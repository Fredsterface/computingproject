["it is an honour to be able to pay tribute to her late majesty queen elizabeth ii and to offer my condolences and those of all of my constituents to king charles and the whole royal family as they face their personal loss right hon and hon members have rightly praised her majesty\u2019s admirable work ethic her sense of duty which has never wavered and her unparalleled dedication to public service her majesty served us right until the very end forever committed to her people and her country she lived and symbolised the very best of our  constitutional system the value of a royal family what it gives to our country and the part that they play in our national life one of the proudest days of my life was when my dad was awarded an obe at buckingham palace my whole family just could not get over the fact that we would get the chance to hang out in the queen\u2019s house on that day it fell to the queen\u2019s daughter the princess royal to hand out the honours but the whole occasion was made magical because it followed precisely the exact example of the queen herself i will also never forget arriving in this place for the very first time in 2010 standing in front of the speaker\u2019s chair and taking hold of this house\u2019s copy of the holy koran on which i swore my loyalty to her majesty the queen as one of this house\u2019s first ever female muslim members of parliament the queen\u2019s relationship with birmingham was strong and in return we brummies had a deep affection for her and gratitude for the time that she devoted to us in the 70 years of her reign over the years she visited villa park the bullring many of our railway stations the nec the international convention centre pebble mill and the hippodrome of course we have just hosted the commonwealth games an important moment for our city which has such a deep connection with the commonwealth and which is inextricably linked with the queen like so many thousands of brummies as much as i am a child of birmingham england and britain i am also a child and grandchild of the commonwealth millions of british citizens have a similar family history making them a part of the commonwealth family and we recognise her majesty as the loving matriarch of the commonwealth its guardian and its guiding light her commitment to the commonwealth and her championing of it recognised and respected our heritage she gave institutional and spiritual meaning and the heart and soul of belonging to those of us who are citizens of our great nation equal before the laws of our land but who do not have centuries of birthright claim upon these our islands and we thank her for it for me the queen\u2019s christian faith always stood out she was a committed christian and as we know supreme governor of the church of england it might surprise some that her commitment to her christian faith could mean so much to those of us who practise and observe other faiths and belong to other faith communities but in a speech at lambeth palace to mark her diamond jubilee the queen said the concept of our established church is occasionally misunderstood and i believe commonly under-appreciated its role is not to defend anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions instead the church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country she was defender of the faith but she was a queen for those of us with other faiths and indeed for those of none may god make it easy for her may he give her loved ones strength and if i may i offer this house an islamic verse which muslims recite when someone dies and which i hope will resonate with the queen\u2019s christian faith too inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon to god we belong and to god we all return ", "to ask the secretary of

particular circumstances at islington gates i am sure that my constituents will have heard and appreciated his recognition of the situation as unfair and unjust could i press him on how he sees the recovery unit working in terms of the carrot-and-stick approaches that we might take with developers that still fail to live up to their responsibilities ", "i beg to move that this house has considered the financial effects of building safety remediation on leaseholders it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr stringer i am grateful to have the opportunity to directly address the minister on some of the ongoing financial impacts of building safety remediation what has come to be known as the cladding scandal on behalf of leaseholders in birmingham ladywood and all over the country last week we saw the five-year anniversary of the grenfell disaster it was a truly horrific tragedy that claimed the lives of 72 people no one who saw that building aflame or the images on the news will ever forget them it has left a mark on not just those affected but the whole country the inquiry into that disaster is ongoing i have a real concern that it may prove to be one of those cases which we have seen too many of in this country of justice delayed being justice denied and that while the inquiry may result in new procedures those responsible for the events that led to that disaster may not be held directly to account we live in hope and i send my solidarity i am sure everyone present will agree to the loved ones of those who perished at grenfell the impact of grenfell has extended much further than most of us could have imagined that tragedy has exposed a shocking litany of regulatory failures and in my view outright negligence which has led as i say to what we now call the cladding scandal we have gotten a little too used to calling it a scandal when we consider the huge impact it has had on my constituents and people all over our country it has exposed huge issues in building safety my experience has been that just as i get my head around one part of the problem many more present themselves i am sure that that has been the experience of the minister and his predecessors the cladding scandal has cost many of my constituents their peace of mind it has cost them financially and wiped out life savings it has left people languishing in the stress of knowing that the building where they live raise their family and go to sleep every night is unsafe and poses a real fire risk it has brought many to the brink of a complete mental and physical breakdown i have sought to support my constituents and have dealt with many of the issues they have raised with me over the many years since this scandal was revealed we have been campaigning together ever since along with other leaseholder action groups that have sprung up all over the country i am particularly grateful to the uk cladding action group and the birmingham leaseholder action group as well as other groups across the country which have relentlessly supported leaseholders of course many of them are leaseholders themselves trying to press the government to act the government have passed new legislation and i state at the outset that i recognise how much the government have moved from their original position and i welcome many of the changes however and it will not surprise the minister to hear me say this i do not consider the new cap which means that some leaseholders will pay some money towards the cost of remediation to be fair because they have done nothing wrong this is not and should not be on them not any part of it not even at a capped amount they should be spared any financial contribution i regret that there is no direct assistance in the building safety act 2022 for leaseholders who have already paid towards remediation work there is the possibility of redress through civil action but the act does not offer any direct assistance nevertheless the main provisions of the building safety act which received royal assent on 28 april come into effect next week and the landscape in respect of leaseholders will change however as the minister has already heard from me and other hon members getting to this point has taken far too long the government have resisted acting in respect of many of the issues that mps have been raising from the outset only to concede that space some years later i remember my first pieces of casework relating to the cladding scandal when government ministers and officials were still distinguishing between aluminium composite material cladding and non-acm cladding all of us involved in trying to seek redress including members of parliament from across the house and leaseholders all over the country pointed out the unavoidable truth that non-acm cladding was just as dangerous as acm cladding and would have to be removed from all the buildings where it was present originally the government held their ground and maintained the distinction but then gave ground and bowed to the inevitable acceptance that non-acm cladding would have to be removed in fact most of the topics on which the government have had to give ground represent issues that have been campaigned on from the start by all the groups i have mentioned and by the levelling up housing and communities committee as well we have come a long way but these five years have taken a very heavy toll ", "the hon gentleman is absolutely right i will be coming on to the issues in relation to insurance later in my remarks may i take this opportunity to say how refreshing and positive it has been to be able to work with members from across the house that has been the house at its best and i am sure that is the reason why we have been able to make so much progress in the building safety act i hope we will continue to work together on the ongoing financial impacts and i  hope to persuade the minister to give further necessary ground i will come to the matters of insurance very shortly many hundreds of people in my constituency have been affected and have been living with the consequences of the cladding scandal for five long years with work having started on some of these buildings if people are very lucky they may finally be able to live in safe buildings in about five years\u2019 time at best we are looking at an entire decade of normal life being wiped out for people caught up in this scandal even that timescale with people losing a decade of their life will be out of reach for many thousands of people in our country i want to bring some of the ongoing issues to life for members and the minister by using an example in my constituency the development at islington gates there are 141 flats in the development which is now described as an orphan block the original developer midlands and city developments went into liquidation in 2007 and miller construction which built the block was bought out by galliford try in 2014 the remediation works at islington gates come in at a total of \u00a39 million some 80% of that \u00a37 2 million relates to the removal of the non-acm cladding that covers the building the remaining 20% \u00a31 8 million relates to additional defects that were discovered and revealed as a result of the scandal including deficiencies in fire compartmentation and other measures as per the new rules in the building safety act the \u00a31 8 million will need to come from the developer and through the cascade effect that the legislation envisages could be passed on to the owner and potentially to leaseholders up to the value of the new cap let us consider the issues relating to the ongoing work for cladding remediation the bid that islington gates submitted to the building safety fund for cover was accepted but the payments came in later than anticipated creating huge cash-flow problems that have further exacerbated the crisis for many of my constituents ", "i completely agree with the hon gentleman i see no reason to maintain a cap if we have conceded the principle that leaseholders are not to blame that developers have made a lot of money out of these developments and that there is money available for the government to go after on behalf of taxpayers all over the country they should do so and they should protect leaseholders from any additional costs i am concerned that the building safety fund still adopts a  computer says no approach in cases such as those of islington gates where eligibility for the fund has been accepted the works are under way and the initial payment has been made administrative errors can lead to delays in further payments for the works and that causes a huge amount of unnecessary stress people are putting up with living in buildings that are completely covered and have no natural light they are putting up with living inside a building site so they have all the noise and dust of that and the general loss of normal life and the amenities that we all have a right to expect this work is unavoidable and necessary but it is in everybody\u2019s interest that it takes place as quickly as possible so leaseholders have a chance of living a normal life soon every time the bsf causes an additional delay that is completely unacceptable if it has accepted eligibility works are under way and the initial payment has been made there should be an expectation that money will be got out the door as quickly as possible for all additional payments if administrative issues need resolution they can be dealt with after the cheque has been paid we have already established eligibility and it is not as though my leaseholders are going to run off with that money there is no risk to the taxpayer will the minister say something about the bsf\u2019s approach and will he make sure it does not add to the stresses and strains that my constituents face in respect of non-cladding defects \u00a31 8 million is required to make islington gates safe the government have made it clear in statements about the legislation and in press releases on their website that they expect developers to take responsibility for any building developed by any company within their corporate group including cases where they acquire the original developer of the building that would mean that the \u00a31 8 million liability for islington gates falls on galliford try which bought miller construction the original builders unfortunately galliford try insists that it has no obligation to pay and none of us has been able to do anything to persuade it otherwise my constituents have been campaigning and i have written to galliford try we have done everything that we can think of to try to persuade it that it must meet its liabilities do the right thing and put up the money to remediate the non-cladding defects revealed at islington gates i understand that in a meeting with some of my constituents civil servants from the minister\u2019s department confirmed that galliford try is the correct entity to pursue for the cost of those remediation works i want to press the minister on just what we are supposed to do now that galliford try refuses to pay it denies any and all liability for the \u00a31 8 million will the minister explain the role he envisages for the department\u2019s recovery unit and whether the department would front up that money and then go after galliford try itself how does he see the new legislative landscape for remediation contribution orders working in respect of leaseholders such as those at islington gates my view i think it is shared by many members across the house is that innocent leaseholders should not have to stump up any more money and then wait for redress at some unknown point in the future that money should be made available now from the correct company which should hold the liability to begin with i turn to insurance costs which the hon member for woking (mr lord) mentioned much attention has been paid to the cost of remediation waking watches alarm systems sprinklers and other measures but it was clear to me from the start from my constituency casework that the cost of insurance was a major problem in my constituency premiums jumped in buildings affected by the cladding scandal at the jupiter 1 development residents saw a 1025% increase in their insurance premium from \u00a340 000 to \u00a3450 000 king edwards wharf saw their premium jump from \u00a350 000 to \u00a3450 000 islington gates used to pay \u00a336 000 and saw that jump to \u00a3320 000 brindley house was in the terrible position of being the first building in the whole country without insurance when it was impossible to get cover for it for a period of time the minister will know that placed all leaseholders and everybody else who was connected to the building in default of their mortgage or rental agreements that was a terrible stress when insurance cover was eventually obtained it jumped from \u00a346 000 to \u00a3322 000 those are shocking increases in insurance premiums it is clear to me that the calculation of the premiums did not take into account the risk in those buildings and in particular the measures that leaseholders have taken to reduce risk in their buildings in each building hundreds of thousands of pounds has been spent on state-of-the-art alarm systems and other measures such as waking watches to bring down the risk of a catastrophic fire none of that was reflected in the insurance premium the more residents have paid for risk mitigation the more their insurance premium has gone up it would have made no difference whether they had done those works or not i think that that is a total con i first wrote to the financial conduct authority and the government at the beginning of 2020 and it has taken two years for a little bit of investigation to be done i welcome the fact that the secretary of state wrote to the fca to ask it to look into the matter but if that had been done in 2020 we would be much further into the investigation into the behaviour of the insurance sector i dare say that if the insurance sector had known that there would be government-level scrutiny of the premiums two years-worth of unjustifiable insurance hikes might not have been visited upon my constituents and people all over the country this problem requires much more than a slow-paced inquiry i would like the government to take much stronger action much more quickly so that we are not still talking about the cost of insurance premiums some years hence the reality is that insurance companies have made money twice over out of the cladding scandal first from the policies they used to indemnify the so-called professionals and the building industry as a whole let us be honest they will not be called to pay out on those policies nobody envisages that insurers will pick up at the tab for this scandal and secondly because they have gone on to charge thousands of people eye-watering sums to insure those buildings they have given people no credit for the money they have spent making their buildings safer to live in while they wait for the final works to be completed it is unconscionable the government should intervene to seek financial redress for affected constituents if the additional cost of insurance were included in the cap brought in by the building safety act 2022 many people would be much closer to that \u00a310 000 anyway and they would be protected from additional costs i wonder whether the minister might address that point and see if there is any possibility of including insurance payments within that \u00a310 000 the secretary of state\u2019s letter to the financial conduct authority asked for suggestions to achieve widely available and affordable cover for leaseholders that letter should  have included some additional asks one being that the fca should consider redress for the insurance hikes that are taking place it is clear to anybody from the outside who is paying attention to the effect of the cladding scandal and making a fair assessment about its financial impact that the insurance companies have gained excessive profits from the building safety crisis they should be required to contribute to the remediation costs on the basis that they covered the actions of the developers that failed to comply with building safety and have since received increased premiums as a result thereof nothing less will do we should look to the insurance companies for further assistance in covering the overall costs of remediation which will in the end fall on the taxpayer in some way shape or form especially if more and more developers do not live up to their responsibilities it is high time the government added insurance companies to the list of people that they need to go after in order to recover some of the costs of this scandal i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say about that ",

proliferation of this type of housing units is causing an avalanche of antisocial behaviour that is destroying neighbourhoods he recently promised when he visited birmingham that he would have urgent conversations with colleagues in the department for levelling up housing and communities and the department for work and pensions but in the opposition day debate that took place in this chamber last week there was no reference to any such conversations having taken place and no home office interest in this matter can the minister tell us what steps are being taken by home office officials and ministers after that visit to birmingham by the policing minister to make sure that the home office plays an active cross-government role in shutting down the loopholes that causing chaos in communities ", "i am pleased to contribute to such an important debate the under-secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities the hon member for walsall north (eddie hughes) is aware of my long-standing interest in this subject and i look forward to the further discussions he alluded to that will take place as the pilot reports are all completed and we think about the next steps particularly in respect of the legislative framework we should be clear that we are talking about a situation unfolding throughout the country as we all speak in which rogue landlords total cowboy operators and some with links to organised crime groups and established criminal enterprises are getting their hands on taxpayers\u2019 cash our constituents\u2019 money and not using it for the purposes for which it was intended but simply lining their own pockets and they are able to do so with absolute impunity that situation is the subject matter of this debate the fact that so many people can do such terrible abusive things well within the rules and totally get away with it no criminal enterprise is going to get done for abusing taxpayers\u2019 cash in this way and that is a problem of the law i take issue with the minister\u2019s saying earlier in the debate that this is not a political issue i agree with him in that i do not wish this to be a party political football with which we play knockabout in the chamber but this is a deeply political issue it is full of political choices we have talked a lot about local authorities what local government can do or does not do and all this  he said she said about local government powers but the fundamental problem and the failure in respect of the subject matter of this debate is one of the law itself and only the government have the power to change the law of this land this is an arena of politics but it is also the uk legislature we are pushing the government today not because of matters of party politics but because only they can act to prevent the abuses that we are all seeing unfold across our constituencies there is no point in my going to the chief constable of west midlands police and saying  i know that a drug dealer is basically setting up as a housing provider in my constituency is going to get enhanced housing benefit payments is going to line his own pockets and is probably going to abuse some of the poor vulnerable constituents who end up in the property he manages because i know the chief constable can do nothing about it not a single thing that is the problem that i and all members in this house with experience in this matter are desperate for the government to fix the problem is the law and only the government can fix the law ", "i thank the hon member for that intervention i accept that it is meant to be in the spirit of being helpful and adding to the debate but the idea that criminal enterprises currently lining their pockets with our constituents\u2019 money will be put off exploiting this business model because of a national statement of expectation is absolutely for the birds i am sorry but that will not work here if it did i would support it because i want this problem fixed i am desperate to see vulnerable people no longer being exploited and communities no longer being destroyed but that measure will not cut it these are proper operators and they have spotted a loophole in the law they have calculated correctly that instead of going further into the drugs business where they might have to do 20 years in prison they can just get into the housing sector and no one will put them away for it at all in fact they can do so in plain sight and nobody can do a thing about it that is what i want the government to take action on because that is what i have seen in my own constituency of birmingham ladywood that is what my colleagues in birmingham have seen in their constituencies and some of them have truly horrific examples of abuse of vulnerable tenants we are seeing that problem all across the country i was very grateful to the hon member for hertford and stortford (julie marson) for saying that this is national issue it can become a little too easy for members in this place to think that this is a problem for some cities let us be honest if we are to be party political about this it is problem for some labour-run cities as my hon friend the member for westminster north (ms buck) said piecemeal action a pilot here and a little bit of a change there just creates a whack-a-mole system a problem that starts in birmingham will soon spread to sandwell to stoke and then to dudley and to other places too unless we have a national change in the law of our land that stops the problem dead for everybody then a member whose constituency is currently not afflicted by it would not have to worry about a proliferation of exempt accommodation taking place in their patch if they do have it in their constituency already they could at least see that there was an end in sight to this absolute abuse of the system which as mr deputy speaker can tell leaves most of us utterly impotent with rage because unless the government change the law we can simply not fix this problem the first area of the law that requires change is the  more than minimal test which has been discussed today the minister made the point that the  more than minimal requirement for the access to enhanced housing benefit regulations has come about as a matter of case law he is of course right that was done by a housing benefit tribunal in this country though we do not distinguish between case law and acts of parliament or statutory instruments the law is the law and if a judicial authority a judge or a tribunal comes to a clarification or a statement of the law that is against what the government expect to happen all that creates is a system that is open to abuse it is the job of this legislature this house of commons to put it right and only the government have the power to introduce that legislation to make it so that rule the  more than minimal requirement must be changed it must be tightened up i do not buy the argument that somehow tightening up the access to enhanced housing benefit will somehow drive the good providers out of the sector that is also for the birds those providers are already doing the things that are required in order to help vulnerable people turn their lives around in the end that is the thing in which we should all be interested these are people who have escaped abusive relationships who have come out of the prison system and are desperate to turn their lives around and who have had addiction issues and need help to turn their lives around they need good quality housing in order to do that the hon member for bury north (james daly) was right when he said that people should be sentenced to a house so that they can have stability the stability that is required to help them turn their life around and become a citizen able to play their full part in society once more that is not possible if the rogue operators get their hands on these people first the good providers who have a moral and a social mission when it comes to supported housing will already be doing the right thing i do not buy the idea that they will be pushed out of the system if the regulations for access to the cash in the first place are tightened up the government and the department for levelling up housing and communities in particular rather than the department for work and pensions need to  tighten up the broader regulatory framework it should not be possible to be providing housing to some of the most vulnerable people in our country and to not even have to pass some sort of character test the idea that the good providers who are operating will fail fit and proper persons tests is a joke they will pass it because they have a social moral mission and they can prove their track record in helping people to turn their lives around if they do not pass it they should not have access to vulnerable people in the first place we know what happens when vulnerable people get into bad accommodation they are ripe for further abuse ripe for further grooming into drug activity and ripe for further grooming into sexual exploitation we should not allow any provider who cannot pass a fit and proper person\u2019s test to get anywhere near some of these people because they will exacerbate the problem rather than alleviate it frankly i have no sympathy with anyone who we currently think of as a good provider but who ends up failing that test because it proves they were not a good provider in the first place we also need more powers for local authorities a point that was also raised earlier in the debate to prevent the dumping of problem people from one part of a country to another i accept that there are some classes of vulnerable individuals who need to break the link with their local area if they are going to turn their lives around but that is not the case for the vast majority of people who have ended up in exempt supported accommodation ", "i agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend that we need a system-wide approach local authorities need the power to reject applications for exempt accommodation on the grounds of saturation or oversupply we must break the habit of putting huge amounts of need into already stretched areas and then wondering why those areas can never recover we wonder why people who have raised their families and committed themselves to stable communities in modest properties that they are proud of whether they are socially renting or have managed to become owner-occupiers are so desperate to leave the areas that they were committed to when we have loaded all sorts of high need into those areas and provided none of the services to support them people dumping has to stop over-saturation has to stop and local authorities need the power to prevent an over-saturation of supply we need community impact assessments before we get large numbers of  exempt supported accommodation across our different communities to ensure we are not loading more need into already difficult areas as i said earlier the vast majority of tenants in exempt accommodation should be able to demonstrate some sort of local link to the area unless it is a requirement because of a prison or domestic violence-related issue most people need some such link in order to have the stability to turn their lives around finally we need an inspections regime we need to keep providers on their toes so that it is not the case that once someone has accessed the system nobody will ever ask them questions again there should be at least an annual check to ensure that people who have access to vulnerable tenants and taxpayer cash are doing the thing they said they would do and fulfilling the promises they made only with government action can we turn the dial on a huge problem that affects not only my constituency but people all across this country our communities deserve nothing less when the minister stands to close this debate i hope he will not simply say  we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re waiting and seeing and we\u2019re going to think about what we\u2019re going to do but give us a legislative timetable for making the changes that are needed ", "the minister is well aware that if councils make a decision not to provide housing benefit and they are challenged in a court of law they will lose such cases because the law itself is not sufficiently tight to prevent the abuse that is occurring i would like to push the minister he has implied that he does not want to move quickly on tightening up the regulations because he is concerned about the impact that would have on the good providers which we all agree are trying to do the  best they can in difficult circumstances but what is it about tightening up the regulations that would be so onerous for the good providers and take out the bad providers the way i see it the good providers are doing what they should be doing anyway and it is only the bad providers that would be targeted by tightening up the regulations i really do want to hear from him what he thinks would be onerous on the good providers if he tightens up the regulations ", "would the minister agree that one of the fastest ways to get action in this area is to destroy the business model of the rogue operators that will not impact on good operators doing the right thing because they are using the extra cash to do the right thing it is the rogue operators that need the scrutiny and the blunt instrument of tougher regulations and a proper test in law ", "i beg to move that this house has considered regulation of supported exempt accommodation it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship ms fovargue i am pleased to have secured the debate today to discuss something that is a huge problem in my constituency in my city and in many other places across the country if someone had asked me a few years ago what supported exempt accommodation was i would not have been able to tell them i know it confuses people even now given my difficulties in dealing with the issue in my own constituency i have become quite a world expert i will set out for all exactly what we mean when we talk about supported exempt accommodation supported accommodation is a broad term that describes a range of housing types group homes hostels refuges sheltered housing and so on an offshoot of supported accommodation is referred to as  exempt it is basically a resettlement place or accommodation provided by a council housing association charity or voluntary organisation where a person or organisation provides the claimant with in theory care support or supervision i say  in theory because too often that is not the case in reality and that is what i will discuss in detail in my speech exempt accommodation is supported housing that is exempt from housing benefit regulations if we provide someone with that type of housing we get access to enhanced housing benefit and can access more money to house this group of mainly vulnerable tenants who are in need of care support or supervision we can see why that has happened the cost of housing vulnerable people care leavers women fleeing domestic violence ex-offenders people with addiction issues and so on is higher the costs of helping those individuals are higher so the exemption from housing benefit regulations the ability to access higher payments to house such people was designed to allow providers to access adequate sums of money to help individuals as they seek to turn their lives around too often that is very much not what happens in practice i stress that there are some good legitimate providers of this type of housing who do important work with people in desperate need of housing and help there are still those who are committed to a social and indeed moral mission to help people to get back on an even keel recover from addiction turn their lives around and play a full part in society once again however there are too many rogue i describe them as cowboy providers who have clocked that this is a lucrative money-spinning  opportunity and who take full advantage they get access to larger sums of money to house housing benefit claimants who need care support or supervision and then they do not provide it in law it is the case that all a provider has to do is provide care support and supervision that is in legal terms  more than minimal those three words have plagued me as i have navigated the complex world of supported housing while trying to help my constituents those who live in such properties and those in communities where there is a proliferation of those types of properties ", "my right hon friend is exactly right i will come to his point about the connection with organised crime which is becoming a real problem he is right that the distortion in the housing market in these communities means that working families are being priced out of good viable family homes other social tenants cannot access them either when a person cannot get enhanced housing benefits they are subject to the local housing allowancein fact this lucrative loophole is causing huge problems not only for the tenants who often get trapped in unsuitable properties but for the communities living in those in those areas and those who might wish to live in them too it is exactly those nefarious operators moving into the sector who are causing problems in my constituency and across the country in practice  more than minimal means hardly anything at all i have heard providers say that installing cctv in communal areas or having a manager who might visit the property once in a blue moon counts as adequate supervision of vulnerable people that sort of so-called supervision would certainly pass the  more the minimal test but the idea that that is what was meant by the regulations that determine access to larger pots of housing benefit is utterly outrageous cowboy operators know that they can access more money per tenant and they do not have to spend very much or indeed anything at all to demonstrate that they are providing care support or supervision so what is the upshot lots of cash is available for those who know how to game the system ", "i thank my hon friend for her intervention and her work in this area i know of the shocking case in her constituency it really speaks to the problems caused by providers in this sector not doing what they are supposed or intended to do i will come on to the regulations that i think need to change later in my speech and i very much hope the minister will take those on board if someone knows how to game the system the next stage is obtaining properties which these providers do by leasing them from owners with that lease-based model providers do not have to shell out large sums of money to buy property of their own they do not have to spend lots of money adapting it either they simply lease houses turn them into houses in multiple occupation or hmos and frankly watch the money roll in this is the other aspect of the exemption in relation to this type of housing providers are exempt from not only housing benefit regulations but other regulations such as planning and licensing laws that enable councils in other areas to limit the types and proliferation of hmos those rules do not apply to supported exempt accommodation having a so-called article 4 direction in a city or area as we do in birmingham does not stop the proliferation of this type of housing in theory we can see what was being attempted with those rules to provide more money to cover the additional cost of housing associated with vulnerable tenants and to allow enough appropriate units to be set up to ensure that an adequate quantity of housing is available again however that is not how things have worked in practice the exemption from licensing rules and regulations that applies to other types of hmo does not apply here whole streets and communities are becoming saturated with family homes converted into hmos providing exempt accommodation housing vulnerable tenants and creating problems for the whole community while failing the tenants by placing them at risk of very real further harm it is a system that is failing everyone ", "my hon friend has been doing huge amounts of work on this issue in her constituency many of my birmingham colleagues are in this chamber today this is a big problem in our city and i thank my colleagues for their interest in this debate and for the work they are doing in their own constituencies my hon friend is absolutely right about regulation and i will come to some of the regulations that will be needed some might be thinking that there is surely someone regulating the system and carrying out the very checks to which my hon friend just alluded there is a regulator for social housing but it simply does not have the powers to deal with rogue operators because those people know how to game the system they have set themselves up as small operators so they are outside of the direct purview of the regulator they can make lots of money with little to no scrutiny which is leaving too many people in my patch in utter despair more than 150 000 households in the country are living in exempt accommodation this represents a 62% increase in five years and there are 1 600 such properties in my constituency alone there has been a massive increase and we are seeing these problems all over the country as i have said the tenants are too often being let down many of my constituents come to me with their problems and many of my colleagues have raised in the house and with the city directly the issues that their constituents face with their properties it is not unusual to find properties that are in complete disrepair and that we would not consider fit for human habitation in any way it is not unusual for vulnerable women to be housed with dangerous men in these properties for them to be at risk of attack or in fact to have been attacked ", "my hon friend is absolutely right she has raised those horror cases in her constituency at regular intervals directly with the department and in this house those cases of women left at real risk of harm having truly suffered at the hands of dangerous men who they should have never been housed alongside are not unique it is not unusual when i have investigated cases in my constituency to discover that the housing contract that was approved has forged signatures on it there are multiple layers of subcontractors that get involved with the providers in this sector and it is not unusual to see faked documents i have had constituents come to me and say that they are being held to a contract that they have never seen before it is also not unusual for people to be left without any hot water or electricity it is often the case that the tenants who are desperately in need of care support or supervision are left to rot in disgusting properties and at real risk of physical danger the residents who live alongside them are also being let  down over-concentration in particular areas just loads more need and deprivation into areas that are already struggling crime and antisocial behaviour has massively increased i have had constituents break down explaining that they are worried that their children are witnessing public drug taking people collapsing in the street having drunk too much or urinating in their front gardens all on what were once modest quiet residential streets that were home to tight-knit communities that is why so many people in my patch and my city are in utter despair ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the example he describes is something i see too often in my own advice surgeries people really are in despair this situation is attacking the heart of the social spirit we need to help vulnerable people turn their lives around people generally want to do the right thing by people who are in trouble they want to have mixed communities where everybody can play a part in uplifting and supporting each other but when there is an over-saturation of need without the necessary supporting services that breaks down the social fabric of our communities and the spirit of social solidarity so many times i meet people in complete despair at the change they have seen in their local areas as a result of the proliferation of exempt accommodation units in many cases they are desperate to move out and leave the places they have always loved because they can tolerate the degradation of the living conditions of the whole community no longer this is all happening in plain sight only the government have the power to act i implore the minister today to commit to taking the necessary action no more pilots or evidence are needed we have plenty of evidence we have been shouting about the evidence for years it is high time that we see some action as others have also said i have been convinced for some time that some rogue operators in this sector have links to organised crime i know that the police have raised concerns at a national level the sector has the advantage of having zero chance of a jail term so we can see why criminals previously involved in drugs or whatever are now concluding that this is a better business to get into what do the government need to do they need to destroy the business model of the rogue operators good providers spend the additional money they receive in the ways in which it was always intended so they will have no difficulty meeting higher legal tests or proving themselves but that is not the case with rogue operators the department for work and pensions needs to tighten up the welfare regulations we need a proper legal test for access to enhanced housing benefit the regulations have to be toughened up and a proper test  for what counts as care support or supervision has to be set out in law we have to cut off the ease with which this extra cash can be accessed from the minister\u2019s department we need tougher regulations and a regulator that has the full range of powers needed to deal with the problem i want to see a tough  fit and proper persons test that has to be passed before any provider is allowed anywhere near the sector no matter how big or small the operator or how many units they have at their disposal it need to be the law that they should all have to pass such a test local authorities need the power to reject applications for exempt accommodation on grounds of saturation or over-supply in a specific area and to insist on community impact assessments that have the power to prevent over-saturation that is the only way we will be able to stop the overloading of high need into already difficult areas all tenants in exempt accommodation need to have some sort of local link to the area birmingham has become in the words of some council officials i have spoken to a dumping ground for people from elsewhere a local link will not always be appropriate i fully accept that in cases of domestic violence and occasionally in respect of ex-offenders a local link needs to be broken to help somebody turn their life around but we cannot simply allow a system where local authorities or national government agencies are displacing huge amounts of vulnerability and need into other parts of the country with no thought whatever for the people left to cope with the changes being made to their communities against their will once a provider has shown that they are fit and proper and we have prevented over-saturation we need an inspections regime to keep providers on their toes and a regulator that has full powers of enforcement to clamp down on those who might still flout the system we need a whole package of regulations to clamp down on the many abuses in the sector i know the minister has been looking into the matter and the minister for welfare delivery has sent me written assurances that he is considering changes to benefits regulation they must understand the desperation we are feeling as vast swathes of our communities are changing right before our very eyes and we have no powers to do anything about it i hope that in his response today he is able to give us some assurance that this government will finally take decisive action to turn this absolute horror around ", "to ask the

constituency neighbour but because he was selected relatively late to be our candidate in birmingham erdington we did not get to meet until we were both newly elected birmingham members of parliament i remember in those early weeks lugging around a massive rucksack that basically had a mobile office in it having no idea of the lobbying required to get ahead in the race for an office in this place jack came over to me we had only spoken a couple of times at this point and told me that he had secured a whole suite of offices in portcullis house on hearing that i was immediately insanely jealous but he went on to ask whether i wanted to share them with him of course i went from insane jealousy to all but falling at the man\u2019s feet with gratitude he laughed and said he simply had to rescue me from my flipping bag because it was practically the same size as me and he could bear it no longer that set the tone for our friendship lots of gentle mickey-taking and loads of laughter i was always struck by how ready jack was we have heard so much about this today with his praise and encouragement it is something that his children spoke so movingly about at his funeral jack would always stop you text you or drop you a note to say he had seen you make a speech or give a tv interview whatever it might be and that it was  first-class absolutely brilliant the best of labour he never hedged his bets when it came to praise did jack but he really believed in generous and uncomplicated affirmation not just of his loved ones but of his friends and colleagues the sincerity meant it always mattered to the person on the receiving end it always made a difference not every conversation with jack was quick he would stop you to talk about the famous  three or four quick things but i soon clocked that the correct number was calculated by taking the number of things jack said he wanted to talk about multiplying it by two and adding three it seemed to work every time and jack always got a promise out of you or maybe more than one promise to attend a meeting to look into something or to join one of his campaigns in one of our more recent conversations he told me he wanted to talk about campaigning four quick things were actually 11 and at the end i laughed and said  jack mate how is it that your four quick things have now led to 10 absolutely urgent immediate priorities for my to-do list i soon regretted admitting those 10 priorities because he then laughed wholeheartedly and said  that\u2019s the target from now on shabana 10 things to be added to the to-do list it is difficult to believe that a man so full of energy positivity and generosity is gone he leaves an immense legacy not just as a titan of the labour movement but as a thoroughly decent good man jack dromey was first class he was absolutely brilliant and he was the best of labour ", "what recent discussions he has had with the financial conduct authority on the regulation of the insurance industry ", "insurance companies are exploiting the cladding scandal by charging leaseholders extortionate punitive and unethical prices for their buildings insurance the treasury and the fca have frankly done nothing while people are forced to find eye-watering sums of money because of a scandal that they did not cause and there is no transparency as to how their premiums are being calculated after many years a government minister has finally written to the fca but will the treasury now step up and ensure that the fca not only looks into this matter but provides redress for my constituents and the thousands of people across this country who are experiencing severe financial distress ", "i shall speak to opposition new clause 3 and to the amendments that although they will not be pressed to a vote this evening would protect leaseholders from the costs of not only cladding removal but the remediation of non-cladding defects i can hardly believe that it is four and a half years since the horrific fire at grenfell and still we are fighting for the robust legal protection that leaseholders in my constituency and across the country need and deserve it is too easy to assume that removing cladding is the beginning and end of the scandal the costs of remediating non-cladding fire safety defects are just as ruinous and blameless leaseholders should not be picking up those costs i have seen for myself the extent of fire safety defects at various buildings in my constituency including the brindley house development where the scale of the  missing firebreaks and other defects was truly shocking the people who were responsible for putting up that building were grossly negligent and in my opinion complete cowboys the regulatory failure whereby buildings were declared fit for human habitation when they contained defective or inappropriate fire safety measures or when those measures were wholly absent is staggering when there were negligent and dishonest practices the costs of remediation should not fall at the feet of my constituents a commitment to full legal protection for leaseholders from all costs both for the removal of dangerous cladding and for the remediation of all other fire safety defects should have been added to the bill today because those issues are not new and have been the subject of intense debate for years ministers and their officials know full well the contours of the debate and the issues at stake so it is not good enough that the government did not make such amendments today instead we will have to wait to see whether full legal protection is made available when the bill goes to the other place we may understand parliamentary procedure and the different staging posts of a bill but to my constituents watching from the outside every single staging post feels like a slap in the face when they are not given the full protection that they need and deserve i associate myself with the comments that have been made about insurance particularly professional indemnity insurance but i want to mention the increased insurance premiums that many of our constituents have faced across the country i have been writing to the government the fca and others for more than two years to ask for action against the insurance industry for the huge increase the hike in premiums that our cladding-affected leaseholders have faced that increase bears no resemblance to the mitigations that our constituents have paid for to decrease the risks in their buildings people have paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for new fire alarm systems and internal compartmentation to try to bring the risk down in their buildings yet that is never reflected in the insurance premiums that they have to pay that is unconscionable there are big questions for the wider insurance sector to answer in addition to the buildings industry it seems to me that someone who has profited from for example charging a building in my constituency an insurance premium of \u00a3700 000 in total which has never come down has some big questions to answer i hope that when the minister brings the bill back to this place we get the time for adequate debate and the further amendments that we need i hope that we take action on insurance and perhaps even god help us implore the fca to do its job and stand by our constituents who deserve the regulator\u2019s protection when the bill comes back i hope that it addresses all those issues as it is high time that the government did right by leaseholders ", "to ask the secretary of state for levelling up

go i the ceasefire is of course welcome we all pray that it holds and is strengthened and that a path forward can be charted but it is essential that all holy sites in that holiest of cities holy to so many people of many different faiths are protected and respected i press the minister to do whatever he can to ensure that there is no repeat of the scenes we saw just a few short weeks ago the history of palestine and israel is in so many ways a perpetual cycle of loss sorrow and conflict pierced only occasionally by moments of hope and fleeting opportunities for positive and lasting change even those moments have become ever rarer in recent years with a cycle of violence that has decimated entire communities led to the loss of countless lives and laid bare the shaky foundations on which any aspirations of a negotiated diplomatic settlement have been built the goal of a viable and sovereign palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel remains the shared objective of so many in this house and all over the world but in truth it has rarely seemed further away the end of benjamin netanyahu\u2019s 12 years as prime minister of israel at least suggests that a path towards a settlement political and practical could be charted indeed the high-wire balancing act that led to his removal points to a long-missing political tenacity that could bode well however among those who have removed an indisputable roadblock to peace are some with still greater belligerence with opinions more extreme and entrenched even than benjamin netanyahu\u2019s the fact that they will serve alongside those with an unequivocal commitment to a viable two-state solution is welcome and it is perhaps to them that we must reiterate that the illegal occupation and proposed annexation of the west bank is violating international law only when they accept that can we make progress in the field of peace any and every road towards a just and lasting peace requires that the occupation is brought to a permanent end with both palestinians and israelis enjoying true and meaningful security dignity and human rights some may try to argue that formal annexation has been stopped that we no longer need be concerned it is impossible to articulate adequately how dangerous and misguided such counsel is the truth is that illegal settlement expansion has continued and palestinians are still being evicted from their homes i cannot condone these violations of international law nor should anyone in this house or in the international community the labour party has repeatedly called on the uk

amendments designed to protect leaseholders make no mistake the funds that the government have made available thus far have taken too much time to come on stream the money will not ultimately be enough to meet the scale of the crisis and crucially interim costs are not covered on top of all those costs today we have heard about the cost of insurance i have lost count of the times that i have pleaded with the government to do something about insurance costs in my constituency there have been insurance increases of 1 000% in affected buildings those are shocking figures and this shocking situation is falling on deaf ears as far as the government are concerned long before any cladding is removed from these buildings the people living in them will have been ruined by the costs of insurance and interim measures such as waking watches to keep their buildings open there is simply nothing left to remedy the internal fire safety defects as well leaseholders need the protection that the lords amendment would offer we should never forget that at any point a further tragedy could god forbid occur that is a terror that leaseholders in brindley house in my constituency have had to

away from the fire engulfing the whole of their building two more minutes and the windows in that flat would have shattered and the cladding wrapped around that building would have caught fire when i heard that my blood ran cold can the minister imagine what it must be like for the people who live in brindley house that is the risk that is the fear and that is the scale of the financial ruination

to their properties that have come about through no fault of their own the only possible answer is no we know that the cladding calamity that has befallen so many of our constituents did not come about because leaseholders have failed in any way all the costs that are attributable to the cladding scandal are down to  failures by developers and successive governments who have presided over shocking scandalous regulatory failure which has pushed thousands of wholly innocent people to the brink of financial ruin we all know that the costs of the regulatory failure that has created this crisis are in the many billions of pounds but they must not fall on the ordinary people who are not responsible for this mess there are other ways i believe that the government can raise the necessary money they should introduce a levy on developers and the construction industry to fund the cost of remediation  both cladding removal and remediating the many other fire risks that many of us in the house have been raising for quite some time the government should also strengthen procurement regulations so that local authorities and metro mayors can prevent developers and construction companies that are failing to live up to their moral obligations and put right the fire hazards that they are responsible for creating from bidding for any further publicly funded development contracts in that way we can reward those who are doing the right thing and putting right the cladding issues in the buildings that they were responsible for putting up and hopefully force a rethink on the part of those who are failing to live up to their responsibilities by preventing them from bidding for further taxpayer-funded contracts but what is clear is that the government must not pin the spiralling costs of this crisis on the ordinary people who are currently facing financial ruination i urge all members to keep the amendment tabled by the bishop of saint albans in the bill because to do anything else is a dereliction of our duty this house must do the right thing by leaseholders this evening ", "i support the motion tabled by the hon member for wealden (ms ghani) and very much appreciate the opportunity this evening for a straight vote on the alton amendment which is particularly welcome in the light of the procedural shenanigans that prevented it last time i want to call out the rank hypocrisy of the government on their approach to the whole issue of determining whether a genocide is taking place they have always ducked the question of whether the chinese regime is committing genocide against the uyghur people in xinjiang by saying that the determination of genocide is a judicial decision not a political one and that it requires legal determination the prime minister said that when he was the foreign secretary when answering foreign office questions in november 2017 he said genocide is a strict legal term and we hesitate to deploy it without a proper judicial decision [official report 21 november 2017 vol 631 c 839 ]in fairness that has been the position of successive governments but this government know that there is no international mechanism that will enable a legal determination on genocide against the uyghurs because china will use its veto none of the options for competent courts under international law is viable now that there is a way forward in a domestic setting with the new alton amendment which in itself is a significant compromise we are no longer considering a role for the high court but one for former senior judges in the house of lords to make a determination on genocide the government say that they are happy to leave this issue to parliamentary select committees instead this is unconscionable unacceptable breathtaking hypocrisy and the house should take a stand against it today if the government are acting in good faith i cannot think of any reason why they will not accept a role for the judges panel in the house of lords as per the alton amendment so we all have a fundamental judgment to make today it has nothing to do with constitutional precedent or any other separate actions that the government have announced today in particular their welcome though long overdue decisions on deploying the magnitsky sanctions regime today is simply about whether we draw a line in the sand and say that britain must not do trade deals with countries that commit genocide that is the only issue at stake here today which is why i urge all members to vote for the alton amendment this evening ", "to

insurance costs issue because there seems to be little relationship between the interim measures that leaseholders are paying for such as very expensive state-of-the-art alarm systems and the cost of the insurance premiums that they are being quoted that has to be called out and it is clear to me that some form of guarantee eventually needs to be offered by the government that reflects a balance of all the risks and affordability for our constituents in terms of the way forward i associate myself with the remarks made from the labour front bench but i also believe that the businesses developers and construction companies responsible for putting these buildings up should face some consequences if they do not step up to remedy the defects that they are responsible for such businesses should not be able to bid for and receive public sector contracts i think of developers such as galliford try in my constituency which is failing to engage with leaseholders over islington gates it is eligible to bid for projects that are part of the west midlands combined authority area framework i do not believe that anyone who fails to live up to their responsibilities and does not pay their due liabilities to wider society should get our money it is unconscionable that ordinary people who are wholly innocent and have done nothing wrong are losing everything that they have ever worked for and that those responsible are getting off scot-free this house should act as one tonight call time on this behaviour and stand with leaseholders ", "to ask the secretary of state for work

councils in their response to the pandemic council leaders at the sharp end of responding to the pandemic were entitled to take him at his word and they were right to do so it is an absolute betrayal that the secretary of state has since gone back on his word and that councils face a total shortfall across all local authorities of \u00a32 6 billion we can compare that with the billions the government have wasted during this crisis on contracts handed out to people with strong links to the conservative party and people who have been donors to the conservative party those contracts have failed to live up to what they were supposed to be delivering all while local authorities face such a huge shortfall it is unconscionable in birmingham we face a shortfall of \u00a3207 million and the

social care \u00a39 5 million on education and \u00a32 3 million on ppe which of those i ask the secretary of state is superfluous to requirements which of those is an add-on or a waste of money none of them they are part of the statutory responsibilities of our local government in birmingham we are expecting a total loss of \u00a344 million in business rates and \u00a320 million in our council tax receipts given the state of the economy does anyone seriously think that business rates and council tax receipts will recover quickly if at all the changes that are occurring to the high street as i speak mean that the hight street is changing beyond all recognition and some of its revenue will never return to local government the expectation of a 5% increase in council tax implicit in the government\u2019s own numbers is morally wrong given the promises that the government made at the start of the pandemic but it is also wrong that the government continue to pass the buck on funding for local government for a decade they have succeeded in devolving the blame for their cuts but they know that the biggest factor that is driving up expenditure of local government is adult social care we have an ageing population and that brings with it increasing costs much of which are currently picked up by council tax payers this method of funding is simply not sustainable the pandemic has brought into clear focus the parlous frighteningly fragile state of our adult social care it is a dereliction of duty that the government have for 10 long years failed to come up with a sustainable solution to the adult social care crisis preferring to let councils and families muddle through that cannot continue i urge the government to change course and come up with fairer more sustainable funding for local government ", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions how many people in receipt of universal credit have been issued with court fine deductions in each of the last

committing genocide i associate myself with the remarks made by my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury (emily thornberry) the shadow secretary of state for international trade on that amendment and on the human rights situation more generally i am grateful for the cross-party efforts that led to the addition of the amendment to the bill i hope that another cross-party effort in this house will be successful today i note the comments the minister made in opening the debate today they follow the position taken by the foreign secretary when he made a statement to the house on forced labour supply chains last week the approach taken by the government is dispiriting and deeply disappointing if the government prevail today i believe they will come to regret it the amendment will first send a clear signal about the absolute basic threshold that must be crossed before we strike trade deals around the world and about the sorts of people countries and regimes that we will do business with not being a genocidal state should be the absolute minimum requirement that all of us in this house should be able to sign up to it would enable the uk courts to make what is in effect an advisory preliminary determination of genocide for the government to consider when they are signing trade deals with states accused of committing genocide the government say that genocide determination is a matter for judges not politicians that is the long-standing position of uk governments of all political persuasions the amendment would provide the only viable legal route to have a genocide determination made by judges that is why the remarks made by the former secretary of state for international trade the right hon member for north somerset (dr fox) just a few moments ago are entirely wrong when we talk about genocide it has  to be a determination made by judges in a legal context the problem is that at the moment the international legal system the routes provided by the united nations and international treaties are frankly a busted flush something is needed to break the cycle of inaction and ineffectiveness we are awash with warm words that simply do not change the situation on the ground all we are currently laying the ground for is an after-the-fact statement of sorrow when genocide has occurred the world keeps saying  never again in relation to genocide yet it occurs with shocking depressing regularity china is of course the most striking example of the failures of the international system the government recognise and condemn the actions of the chinese regime against the uyghur people in xinjiang mountains of evidence exist about forced sterilisation mass detentions slave labour and the destruction of culture and heritage to my mind a genocide is being perpetrated by the chinese regime against the uyghur people but of course that requires a legal determination in a court to have legal force rather than simply political and moral force every international legal route is blocked by the chinese government china has a veto it has a majority on the un human rights council and is not a party to the international criminal court the amendment provides a mechanism for the uk high court to make a preliminary determination in the context of a trade agreement if the uk high court rules that the extremely high evidential bar for the crime of genocide is satisfied its judgment will be available for the government to consider perpetrators of genocide should not be rewarded they must know that actions have consequences and an increasingly belligerent china needs to see\u00a0that the british government will not simply stand by and watch impotent and unable to do anything whatsoever the modest import and export restrictions linked to forced labour abuses that were made by the government last week are welcome but they do not deal with the specific charge of genocide so i am afraid that that action although it is welcome and although it was taken by the government only last week cannot get them off the hook on agreeing with the amendment today the amendment does not give the courts too much power it is supported by eminent lawyers in the other place who have dealt with the issues around the separation of powers far better than i can in the short time available to me in any case if the government agree that genocide determination is a matter for judges the fact that at the moment their position amounts to saying that they will go along with a genocide determination made by international judges through the international system but not one made by our own high court to my mind simply does not stand up the amendment does not prevent the international legal system from kicking into action although frankly that seems impossible at this point in any case it is a preliminary determination it would enable the word  genocide to be used credibly in a legal sense and i simply do not buy the idea that the courts would be swamped with vexatious claims they can will and regularly do dismiss claims that lack minimum standards of evidence i say to the minister that if the amendment still does not work for the government they should have considered compromise amendments and efforts to reach compromise offered by members  from their own benches which i agree with and support they say we have no trade agreement with china we do not have an fta with china but we have other bilateral trade agreements with china such as the uk-china bilateral trade and investment treaty others could be made genocide is described as the crime above all crimes surely we can all agree in this house today that it must be the minimum starting point for the conditions we will place on whom we will trade with i urge the

that he has just made so profoundly depressing in case he or anybody else has not got the memo the virus has already started to run amok in our country the government have already lost control of this virus at a time when we all need to pull together in the context of a global emergency the government are pursuing rhetoric and a narrative that is all about dividing communities from one another and sowing division as if our country needs any more division after the last few years we have already had quite enough of that why pit mayor against mayor why pit region against region the virus does not care for geographical boundaries or which local or national official is ultimately responsible for any of our policies the virus is running wild through our country we all need to pull together and the government therefore need to behave as the government of a united kingdom and pursue a national strategy that is comprehensible and understandable to the vast majority of us one that is rational and does not mean careering from one type of measure to another doing 180\u00b0 turns from one day to the next we need some rationality and a clear national strategy from the government the virus has shown the absolute mess of english devolution under this government because it is not true devolution it is just devolution of blame and responsibility for decisions that local people are not involved in the government are going to have to change course because everything that we know about strategies that work to get the virus under control shows that we need local expertise and locally led decision making we also need a package of support that can protect jobs and businesses nothing that the government have done since the tiers were introduced particularly in areas such as mine which is under tier 2 restrictions will go far enough to protect jobs livelihoods and businesses which will be crucial to our economic recovery when we are through the worst of the crisis the cost of borrowing is low at this point i say to all those who behave as though this one change in the measures to support businesses and jobs will somehow destroy our economy we are in unprecedented times the cost of borrowing is low and we should do what other nations are doing we should provide as much support as necessary to save as many jobs and businesses as possible so that there is a viable economy for us to regrow once we are back out of this crisis finally i urge the minister to deal with the fact that areas in tier 2 such as birmingham are in the worst of all worlds because their business base has been decimated by public health measures but businesses are not forced to close so they do not get any support it is nonsensical that we should end up wishing we were in tier 3 just to get some

secured an adjournment debate on the plight of the uyghur people i had hoped that we would see more progress since that debate on 9 september i had hoped that we would see the imposition of so-called magnitsky sanctions against key individuals from the chinese communist party but sadly we are no further on and the plight of the uyghur people against whom i am quite clear the chinese communist party is perpetrating genocide becomes ever more desperate my hon friend the member for islwyn (chris evans) and the right hon member for chingford and woodford green (sir iain duncan smith) have both given a huge amount of detail about what the uyghurs are suffering as a result of the actions of the chinese government they have detailed issues around forced sterilisations the drop in the birth rate a drop of almost a third in xinjiang province mass detentions slave labour and the destruction of culture and heritage families are being torn asunder and we all wonder as we look on in horror how much more the uyghurs will endure as the world simply watches impotent and unable to act i have pressed the minister before on his rationale for not pursuing magnitsky sanctions when i questioned him in september he told me that i was right to press him on this point i believe that i am right to do so members who make similar arguments about magnitsky sanctions are right to do so too it is completely unclear why the government are still dragging their feet the case for the imposition of sanctions against individuals about whom we have clear evidence has been made what is the roadblock i would like the minister to explain what the roadblock is because we deserve to know too many members across the house have been pressing him on this point and have got very little out of the government since that adjournment debate in september the government have moved with lightning speed on the imposition of magnitsky-style sanctions against individuals connected to the regime in belarus and the rigged re-election of president alexander lukashenko it was announced that sanctions were being drawn up on 24 september and they were imposed on 29 september it took merely days i contrast that with what is happening to the uyghur people and the actions that the government are still considering against key individuals in the chinese government we have many years-worth of evidence and months and months of review from our government but still no action we have heard that the americans have taken action and imposed sanctions against key individuals in the regime what is the reason for the uk not following suit the legal tests have been met but perhaps there are political tests and ever-shifting political tests that have not been met if that is the case that is a low moment for our government as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green has said no amount of trade can wipe out the actions of a regime that is committed in the case of the uyghur population to genocide i echo the remarks that have been made about the amendment tabled by lord alton in the lords to the trade bill i hope that when the bill returns to the floor  of the house of commons labour spokespeople will support that amendment and i hope that the shadow minister will enlighten us on that today i hope that the amendment receives cross-party support because it is an important step and is one of the legal innovations that i told the minister we must consider given that we all know that the united nations is a bit of a busted flush on the issue the chinese with their veto in the security council and the buying up of influence we have seen in the last few years will be able to ensure that any un process is frustrated and even prevented from getting off the ground we therefore need more innovative and legal approaches and empowering our own high court to nullify trade agreements with regimes where the trade partner is with good evidence believed to have perpetrated a genocide would be an important step forward it would be a way for our country with our long commitment to the rule of law and to calling out egregious human rights abuses wherever they occur in the world to make a real contribution i therefore hope that approach has support across the house i will certainly seek to support it i hope that  the government can bring forward such measures if there are concerns that such mechanisms may be used in vexatious ways before our high court may i say to the minister that we can come up with thresholds and tests that must be met before the high court could make such a declaration it is however an important thing for us to consider it is an important step for us to take and i hope it will happen finally i have a couple of quick remarks about uk supply chains in relation to chinese production of personal protective equipment and in particular ventilators procured by our government for use during the pandemic there is a clear real risk that personal protective equipment and ventilators that have ended up in use in our health system in the last few months procured at great cost in the middle of an international emergency may well have come about as a result of forced labour of the uyghur people if that is the case that is an unconscionable breach we must do much more as a country to ensure that forced labour slave labour and the labour of the uyghur people is not found in either the clothes we wear and the technology we use or the kit that our national health service uses allowing for the international emergency there are many more questions for the government to answer about the checks that took place to ensure that uyghur labour was not being used for the procurement of things now in our health service i hope that the minister can enlighten us today in my view all legal tests have been met for our government to act it is time for the minister to stop repeating the words he has given to all of us before and lay out some practical action because the time has long passed for us to act against the chinese government ", "to ask the secretary of state for justice what the ten longest lengths

has proven to be the case even amid growing international fury in many quarters the chinese government continue unhindered with a campaign of what can only accurately be described as genocide but where we should expect leadership and action there is only a yawning void we learned this week of one of the most striking examples of choosing to look away from what is happening to an entire people at the hands of the chinese government the disney corporation that self-styled beacon of wholesome positivity chose to film its latest blockbuster movie  mulan in the very province where the uyghur people are being interned tortured and forcibly sterilised disney even thanked the state authorities in china for their co-operation there is a particularly savage irony in a story of family friendship and emancipation being filmed against a real-life background of forced sterilisation families torn asunder and cold-blooded torture in short against a backdrop of genocide the repression of uyghur muslims by the chinese government has a depressingly long history but in the last few years the state has become bolder and more belligerent in the scale of atrocity that it is willing to commit its bullishness is matched only by its brazenness it is estimated that more than 1 million people are being held at internment camps in xinjiang and the chinese government are showing no signs of pausing their orchestrated campaign we have all seen the horrific drone footage showing men being rounded up and we have all heard the stories of forced labour camps the testimony of witnesses is becoming ever more disturbing earlier this month a uyghur doctor spoke to itv she speaks of participating in at least 500 to 600 operations on uighur women including forced contraception forced abortion forced sterilisation and forced removal of wombs she told me that on at least one occasion a baby was still moving when it was discarded into the rubbish in the same programme a uyghur man

government i think we should aim for more debates on the floor of the house with more time rather than end-of-day adjournment debates like this one the genocide convention to which china is a signatory defines genocide as specific acts against members of a group with the intent to destroy that group in whole or in part these acts include killing causing serious bodily or mental harm deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about the group\u2019s physical destruction imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group any one of these categories constitutes genocide the overwhelming evidence of the chinese government\u2019s deliberate and systematic campaign to destroy the uyghur people clearly meets each of these categories ", "i thank the hon lady and agree with everything she said her remarks are testament to how much cross-party agreement there now is about what is happening to the uyghur people at the hands of the chinese government i would certainly welcome an opportunity to work closely with her and other conservative members so that we can lobby their government to take the action that we would all i am sure like to see we should all be alarmed and appalled by what we are seeing but we should all also resolve to forge a path forward for uyghur freedom i do believe that as the hon member for wealden (ms ghani) said our government can play a key role in averting disaster the time has certainly come for magnitsky-style sanctions on individuals whether state or non-state actors where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person  is involved in serious human rights violations in xinjiang there is no good reason to explain why these have not already been activated i believe that the government\u2019s current position is that the evidence is not there yet a position that i have to say i find incredible if the evidence we already have is not strong enough then could the minister tell us what more is required what line has to be crossed before we say that sanctions are now appropriate sanctions alone will not of course be enough we should go further in using and enforcing domestic avenues of accountability in particular corporate accountability relating to supply chains as my hon friend the member for coventry south (zarah sultana) remarked we cannot allow the fruits of forced labour to end up on our shores and in our homes i know that british people everywhere would be appalled to think for example that the personal protective equipment that we have all come to rely on could have been produced by the abused and subjugated people of xinjiang if our words on eradicating modern slavery are to mean anything then surely the commercial goods that the uyghurs and others in xinjiang are forced to make should be squarely in our sights both these options relate to following and then attacking the money as distasteful as it may seem money does matter a very great deal the chinese communist party has busily been buying up influence and the silence of other countries a challenge based on restricting the flow of money for key regime individuals and also for companies both chinese and others that are benefiting from these crimes would hit where it hurts and send a clear message too there are legal options as well i know that the situation is complicated china is of course a permanent member of the un security council but we should not let that stand in our way as the hon member for wealden made clear i know that the government are proud to have co-ordinated a joint un statement and i am sure that the minister will remark on that i do not wish to sound uncharitable as to the actions that the government have been trying to co-ordinate i know that even getting to that point faced with a concerted counter-effort by the chinese government is significant but i also know we can do better as the bar human rights committee has said we should lead efforts to establish an impartial and independent un mechanism such as a special rapporteur or maybe an expert panel to closely monitor the situation in xinjiang we should investigate the viability of more innovative legal approaches that could be taken as we have seen in respect of the rohingya the international criminal court has intervened to probe the violence against myanmar\u2019s rohingya community because part of the crime deportation has taken part in bangladesh which falls within the jurisdiction of the international criminal court even though myanmar itself does not similarly we know that deportations are taking place from jinjiang to tajikistan and cambodia and people are then repatriated to china and later murdered tortured or sterilised ", "my hon friend makes an important point we can be in no doubt as to the ambitions that the chinese government have president xi jinping made clear in his 2050 vision statement the sort of dominance that his country wishes to achieve if the current actions of the chinese government are allowed to go unchecked for any longer we are heading for a very dark century indeed which is why we must all take action and press the minister today ", "the points that my hon friend highlights go to the fact that many of us now think that the tests for what constitutes genocide are being met by the chinese government it is truly depressing that because of the growing dominance of the chinese government and the way in which the united nations institutions work so much of the international community is just completely unable to effectively stand up and say  this is not going to happen too often the world just says  never again we were supposed to have  never again on genocides decades ago yet they have continued to take place and one is taking place even now what will it take for the world to act that is why i want to push the minister very strongly on that point the government can do more to consider more innovative legal approaches i will refrain from making comments on the rule of law which everybody has been discussing in the past 24 hours with regard to our treaty obligations but the minister will know because he has to have the conversations with his chinese counterparts and others that britain must be believed to be a country that stands by its international obligations and the rule of law that is one of the great gifts that we have and it is one of our key strengths as a country when we play our role on the international stage the government should right what they have done wrong in the past 24 hours so that we can make representations with the full force of moral and legal authority that we have enjoyed for a long time one thing is indisputable nothing will change unless co-ordinated robust political force and pressure is applied while commercial financial and legal routes to take action against the chinese government are navigated and explored the uk now has a choice as to whether to lead the charge or turn our backs and allow these atrocities to continue once the outrage has inevitably subsided i support the actions that the government have taken and intend to take in relation to hong kong citizens and i have supported the government\u2019s decision in  relation to huawei in fact i think it is high time that we as a country take a more realistic and clear-eyed approach towards our relationship with china as the shadow minister my hon friend the member for aberavon (stephen kinnock) has said we have frequently rolled out a red carpet for the chinese government but got nothing in return surely the perpetration of a genocide necessitates a full review and reset of our relationship ", "the hon gentleman makes a powerful point the scale of what is happening in china defies belief the videos that we have now seen and that are being pursued by commercial television news channels such as itv lay out starkly the reality of what is happening and we cannot turn away as he says one of the great crimes of the 21st century is being committed before our very eyes whatever happens next we will not be able to say that we did not know we did we do and we must act because it is not too late for us to avert the worst of this developing atrocity history will judge us for the unforgivable lack of action thus far but it will also judge us for the choices we make in the coming days and weeks ", "that is exactly why i have laid out with some clarity i hope the case today for magnitsky-style sanctions for action against companies that are benefiting from the forced labour in the camps and for approaches that can be pursued in the arena of international law difficult though that is given the position we are in with the united nations and china\u2019s status as a permanent member of the security council it is in our gift to stand up to the chinese government it is in our gift to give voice to those chinese citizens who are as i speak being shaved sterilised dehumanised and brutalised it is in short in our gift to do so much more to halt this genocide enough is enough britain must lead the way ", "i listened carefully to the secretary of state\u2019s speech apart from the litany of excuses that he offered to explain how the exams fiasco came to unfold none of it his own fault of course he did not offer a compelling reason why the document that the opposition motion calls for should not be released to the education committee i appreciate that he intends to give evidence i hope it will be fulsome to the select committee when he appears before it next week but our motion asks for a higher degree of disclosure than is the normal practice when secretaries of state attend select committee hearings he offered nothing substantive about why that should not happen as our humble address suggests for all the young people who have been on the receiving end of this government\u2019s incompetence the inescapable conclusion that they will draw from all that they have heard from government members today is that rather than being the result of a  mutant algorithm the blame for this fiasco lies squarely at the secretary of state\u2019s door when he was warned about the problem with the exam system why did he not address the issues that were raised we had no answer on that point today why were the government so willing to preside over a situation in which the top grades at private schools were increased far beyond those of their state school at counterparts we had no answer on that point today either i want to address the situation in relation to btecs and i welcome what the chair of the education committee the right hon member for harlow (robert halfon) had to say about that the situation has been very much mishandled and that is depressing to see btecs do a great job of contributing towards social mobility which has been frankly limited over the past decade the secretary of state will know that almost half of students whose parents are in routine or manual jobs study btecs or a mixture of btecs and a-levels compared with just over 22% of those whose mums and dads work in higher managerial administration roles half of white working-class and black british students in england get into university with qualifications that include btecs those students should not have been left languishing at the back of the queue waiting longer than anybody else for their results to be confirmed they have been treated with a particular degree of disrespect and it would have been good to hear the secretary of state give an apology at the dispatch box today to btec students and a confirmation that they will not be forced into the same position next year what we have seen unfold over the summer is not simply a story of government incompetence it is the inescapable end point of the political approach that has been adopted by this government one that has degraded teacher assessments and coursework they must change course before next summer ", "in my constituency of birmingham ladywood up to 8 600 jobs are at risk if the chancellor presses ahead  with the removal of the furlough scheme and the self-employed income support scheme in october and if he does not change course and adopt a targeted continuation of both schemes for particularly hard hit sectors my constituency already had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country before the pandemic hit my fear is that if many of the jobs of those currently on wage support schemes go then my area and my city will take much longer to recover than other parts of the country i want to make the case for the arts and entertainment sector i know that many are making cases for different sectors in this debate but there are 60 000 jobs in the arts and entertainment sector in my region of the west midlands and birmingham is at the heart of many of those jobs my constituency encompasses the whole of the city centre which is home to many of the venues and therefore the jobs in the sector it is therefore crucial to my area and the social cultural and economic life of birmingham the sector is struggling because it cannot get back up and running like other sectors can the public health advice and the laws that are in place because of public health mean that its businesses cannot get back to normal in those circumstances it is unconscionable that economic support does not follow where the public health rules lead us everything we heard from those on the treasury bench today about the challenges in continuing a sector-specific wage support scheme sounds very hollow to all those who are desperately trying to save their jobs the government have shown real creativity in coming up with economic policy to deal with the impact of the pandemic and that should not stop now they should overcome the hurdles that are in place to adopt a sector-specific approach because every job in every sector that is saved today or in the next few months will decrease the scale of the bills we will all face when we ultimately have to pay off the costs of this pandemic the cost of supporting jobs and sectors facing total collapse those businesses are going to go to the wall will be cheaper than the cost of inaction which will be much more expensive in the long run the government\u2019s current approach i am afraid to say not only does not make economic sense but fails the test of fairness too in the short time left to me i wish to make the case for birmingham in particular because we are due to host the commonwealth games in 2022 if the heart of our arts and entertainment sector is ripped out from our city we will not be able to see the full benefits of what the commonwealth games could bring to the brilliant city of birmingham i urge the treasury to take a region-specific approach and take into account factors such as international events so that we can have the full benefits for all our constituents benefits envisaged when we win such bids in the first place ", "to ask the secretary of state for health and social care what advice he is giving to

welcoming the bill and in relation to what is needed in respect of fire safety funding for fire services and in particular justice for the grenfell community i shall focus my remarks on the plight of leaseholders in my constituency who have been badly affected and for whom i believe the government need to take much stronger action i represent hundreds of people who have been affected by cladding-related issues including those in the islington gates development and at brindley house in my constituency islington gates is a 144-unit development and brindley house is a 182-unit development both have flammable cladding which has rendered the buildings unsafe in my view the government have not moved quickly enough in dealing with cladding that is not of the acm type that we saw in the grenfell fire i welcome the new \u00a31 billion fund but it took far too long for us to get to that point it was the result of sustained campaigning from members across the house the labour front bench and campaign groups such as the uk cladding action group the birmingham leaseholder action group and manchester cladiators alongside many others who kept up the pressure on the government ahead of the budget that the announcement of the remediation fund was eventually made some big questions remain unanswered about that fund on the speed with which the fund will be paying out for remediation works and on whether there is enough money to cover the cost of all the works that will be required in buildings such as islington gates and  brindley house if the money is not enough the government need to make it clear that they will meet any and all of those costs and that the \u00a31 billion fund does not represent the limit of the support that the government are prepared to make available these issues are difficult enough for the people who live in these properties but many such as those i represent have now been overtaken by another even more pressing matter the insurance cover for their buildings on this issue there has been a depressing lack of understanding and engagement from government if we are not to preside over an even bigger social disaster that has to change at islington gates residents were already paying very large sums for interim fire safety measures before they were hit with a fivefold increase in the cost of insuring their building from \u00a336 000 to \u00a3190 000 they had to find a consortium of five insurers to provide cover for their building when those sums are added to the money that leaseholders already have to find for interim fire safety measures they are looking at bills of many tens of thousands of pounds more than some of them will earn in a whole year for residents of brindley house the new quote for their insurance costs is 1 000% higher having soared to \u00a3530 000 the commission and taxes alone on their premium are more than the whole of their premium for the previous year last year they spent \u00a3150 000 on internal compartmentation and fire door works they are paying over \u00a3180 000 for their 24/7 waking watch and on top of all that they have had to pay \u00a3100 000 to replace their fire alarm system can ministers on the treasury bench imagine the stress of receiving a bill for a sum that is much more than they earn in a year on top of that is the tightening of everyone\u2019s financial circumstances as a result of the covid crisis my constituents are enduring a level of stress that has left them at breaking point their situation is unconscionable given that they have done nothing wrong they are facing the consequences of national regulatory failure and they should not simply be left to it i have asked the government repeatedly to take action on insurance for buildings affected in this way in other parts of the sector where insurance companies have been unwilling to provide affordable cover for natural disasters such as flooding the government have stepped forward with measures such as the flood re scheme i urge them to consider stepping forward in a similar way on cladding insurance cover it offends every part of our british values our sense of fair play and

there is an air of slight unreality about the debate as other members have remarked the budget was out of date almost immediately from the moment the chancellor sat down after delivering  it because of the scale of the crisis the fast-changing situation that we are living in and the difficulties that businesses and people are facing all over the country it is vital that we do everything we can in a national effort to keep people in work and to get cash to struggling businesses in that context i welcome the chancellor\u2019s announcement today that the bounce-back loans are now 100% government backed but i must say we are far behind other countries in particular the us china germany and switzerland on measures to get money through to small and medium-sized enterprises so often we describe smes as the lifeblood or the engine of our economy yet we are failing to get the right level of support to them quickly enough in this crisis that is why we have seen multiple announcements made to correct defects in previous announcements that approach is simply not good enough in my view the government need to go much further than the current schemes because they are not equal to the task that we face in particular they must as a matter of urgency streamline the application process and remove the high barriers that are in place at the moment for businesses to prove their viability i understand the argument about placing too high a burden on future generations but if we fail to take adequate action now that burden will be high in any event we must try to limit the long-term damage to our economy and that means supporting small and medium-sized enterprises much more than we are doing at the moment this crisis highlights more than ever the need to deal with fundamental weaknesses in our economy i think in particular of my constituency the challenge that we have with long-term unemployment and the plight of the working poor we cannot allow such structural weaknesses in our economy to continue after the crisis which has exposed the dangers that we see as a result of those fundamental weaknesses the shadow chancellor said and i agree with her that after the crisis we will need a new economic settlement we will need a new economic settlement not only in our domestic politics and economy but in the international sphere as well so i will speak a little about the digital services tax i welcome the new 2% tax on revenues of search engines social media platforms and online marketplaces that derive their value from uk users as we all know this measure will not deal with the differential tax treatment between brick businesses and click business and it will certainly not deal with amazon which continues to grow exponentially but it is a step in the right direction i appreciate that there is a debate to be had about whether to take multilateral or unilateral action in this space but as far as i am concerned the status quo needs breaking apart and that can happen only through governments taking unilateral action in this case i urge the government to go further we cannot keep standing by watching this ridiculous situation where hugely wealthy companies pay little or no tax in countries such as ours where they have a huge presence the current crisis means that once we emerge from covid and all its related difficulties for our economy it will not simply be a case of playing populist politics i simply do not think the public will accept a situation in which such huge multinational enterprises do not pay a fair share of tax in countries such as ours where they  create a huge amount of their value something needs to break open the logjam on this in the international sphere we know that the us will react but we must be bold and we must be brave we

hundreds of people affected by the cladding issues including in the islington gates development in the jewellery quarter area of my constituency the 144-unit development has already had remedial work carried out residents pay for a waking watch and lighting upgrades and at the moment structural fire resilience work is being carried out including around fire compartmentalisation the work is estimated to come in at a total of \u00a31 5 million about \u00a35 000 per leaseholder and that is before they get to the cladding removal they are trapped by the same problem that many of our constituents have they have non-acm cladding but it is just as dangerous if not more so than the acm cladding that qualifies for government relief the bill for the removal of acm cladding looks as though it will come in at about \u00a35 million to \u00a36 million so each leaseholder faces a bill of about \u00a340 000 to \u00a350 000 on the point about insurance the premium for the building in the previous year was \u00a336 000 but when residents came to renew they found their insurer would not renew the building on its own so the residents had to go through a broker and a huge amount of stress trouble and difficulty to find a consortium of five insurers willing to share the risk of insuring the building and the premium has now come in at \u00a3190 000 a fivefold increase it seems residents have received no credit for the fact that they have carried out a huge amount of remedial work already no matter what people trapped in such buildings do the insurance companies are running scared the government could take action as they have in areas affected by flooding for example we already have the good example of the flood re scheme the government should stand behind our leasehold constituents and force the insurance companies to act it is unconscionable that such buildings might in the end be uninsurable without government action our constituents are hit with a multiple whammy

social media reaction and the past couple of weeks have been a difficult and challenging experience difficult because i have been forced to confront head-on the appalling reality that my  comments and in a number of instances the reporting on my comments has led some to think me a homophobe and challenging because i have felt that my intentions which were to get a fair hearing for everyone and give voice to people who have felt excluded from a process have been both lost and misunderstood let me be clear i think rse should be taught in schools that the curriculum should be inclusive of all and that includes the lgbt community and that all of it should be taught at the right age and in the right way i continue to call out in the strongest terms the homophobic banners chanting and hostile protests at parkfield school in birmingham because they are wrong and feed the very prejudices that i want to help to eradicate i am happy to discuss debate and listen to all communities but i have been a little taken aback by some of the comments made about my position some of which have been quite simply untrue my involvement first came about when a large number of parents turned up at my weekly advice surgery in january they had come to share with me their concerns about a lack of proper engagement ahead of changes to rse at the schools their kids attend and the delivery of education under the purview of the equality act they were measured and respectful but also genuinely angry and frustrated why because there had been a breakdown of trust between the school leadership and the parent body it was and is my hope to restore that bond of trust but we must all reflect on and learn from how it came to pass it is not a breakdown born of bigotry or hate it is one born for the most part of a failure of process policy and oversight under the new guidelines schools will make choices about what they think the best approach is indeed a variety of approaches will be developed all achieving the same end but in different ways it is imperative that there is honesty and trust between schools and parents if a school leadership team oversells and overstates or undersells and understates what is required in order to duck challenging conversations about the choices and discretion that the law allows them we will have conflict where there need be none we need to bottom-out what good consultation looks like because in my part of birmingham there are many examples of bad consultation i have been heartbroken to see the contempt with which some parents in my constituency have been treated some deeply troubling and discriminatory assumptions that because these people look a certain way they will think a certain way  lie at the heart of that treatment so where is the dispute resolution process to fix this mess any sensible person would say that we must either construct a system designed to stop disputes occurring in the first place or have a system to deal with them once they have occurred what we actually have is a system that assumes there will not be any disputes at all that does a disservice to everyone not least of all the children where they still exert control local education authorities can respond and move quickly to ensure that everyone is represented within a structure that is designed to stop disputes and foster a sense of shared mission between different minority communities but academies are not designed in that way and that is a real problem it is a matter of profound regret to me that the clash between rights and the role of the state and the issue of whether all our protected characteristics are protected equally have found themselves played out in our classrooms the question of what happens when there is a clash remains if others like me happen to think it is not possible to twitter-storm out of existence everyone with a view different from their own a different approach is required one that is focused on dispute resolution negotiation compromise and reconciliation it is terrible to see communities pitted against one another we cannot allow hard-won advances for the lgbt community to be quietly rolled back but nor can we allow faith to be re-badged as bigotry or shout down those with sincere questions or concerns hard conversations cannot be avoided forever this very institution must ultimately be the one that reconciles the competing rights and needs of different groups which is what the guidance clearly seeks to achieve my fear though is that without more it will fall short ", "will the minister give way ", "i appreciate the minister\u2019s comments about how schools are expected to behave as a result of the new guidance but he has still not addressed the material point about what happens when schools and parents disagree what is the mechanism for resolving that dispute what rights will parents have in that process the process he outlined in relation to parkfield was made up as he went along and is not a process that parents can rely on as the guidance is rolled out ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this debate mrs moon the turnout of hon members from across the house is testament to its importance it is a little disappointing that the debate clashes with the statement by the secretary of state for education we will be making our speeches a little bit in the dark as most of us have been here in westminster hall rather than in the chamber for that statement matters may have moved on a little depending on the content of the secretary of state\u2019s statement i wonder if that government statement was initiated by this debate and the e-petition which many of our constituents signed i want to put into context my contribution and the perspective of my constituents my hon friend the member for warrington north (helen jones) discussed the whole range of issues around sex education relationships and sex education and relationships education however most of my constituents have been contacting me about the specifics of mandatory relationships education at primary school none of my constituents is seeking particular or differential opt outs at secondary school level it is all about the age appropriateness of conversations with young children in the context of religious backgrounds when these issues were first raised with me i did what all hon members do i turned to the law itself what does the children and social work act 2017 say in respect of mandatory relationships education for primary school pupils section 34 gives the enabling power to the secretary of state to lay down the regulations and guidance which i believe is the subject of the statement in the house today it says that religious background and age appropriateness must be taken into account that is the legislative protection for faith communities so that children who are being educated in any part of the education system outside the faith school system are protected and have their religious background taken into account before any relationships education is delivered according to the legislation there must be a consultation failure to hold a consultation has led to a number of issues arising in my constituency and across birmingham it was not just a badly conducted consultation that did not involve all parents there was no consultation whatever that is in direct contravention of the spirit of the  draft regulations and the draft guidance and the absolute commitment in section 34 in relation to religious backgrounds parents come to me in my advice surgery and say  there is no consultation shabana who do we complain to it turns out that there is no process and no guidance for how to deal with those concerns those parents\u2019 first question to me is  what is the sanction when a school fails to carry out any consultation at all it appears to me that there is no sanction or mechanism the regional schools commissioner does not have a role i do not think that the secretary of state has a role nobody seems to be able to say what the sanction is when the process fails if a school does carry out a consultation the question is who decides what is appropriate and what is not what happens when you have conflicting views between different sets of parents that is particularly important in respect of religious backgrounds as a member of a faith community myself i can tell the house that we are not all the same there are many differences of opinion between religious groups between different groups of muslims on what is appropriate i welcome those from faith communities who are watching this debate from the public gallery i hope they will not mind me noting that many are from the orthodox jewish community there is an interpretation of religious texts within the jewish community that leads people to what is described as an orthodox set of values and beliefs there is also a self-described modern progressive and reform end of the jewish community as there is in the muslim and christian communities in all faith communities in fact what happens when religious background is taken into account in a primary school setting in birmingham and there are two groups of muslim parents with full religious conviction one of which says  actually we think this is unacceptable and the other says  no this is perfectly acceptable who is the arbitrator when  their rights collide there is nothing in the guidance and no consideration of the fact that it is perfectly possible for religious groups to come to different views about what is appropriate ", "my right hon friend has been attempting to reconcile conflicting interest groups in his constituency as he will discuss later he is right that most cases in our constituencies have arisen in academy schools for which there is nowhere to go other than the secretary of state if those schools were within the family of birmingham local authority schools we could at least come together in a joint process that respects and gives voice to religious backgrounds not just moderate reform or progressive religious communities but orthodox ones we could negotiate a settlement that does justice by all parties allows all our valued loved and respected communities to be included in that process and enables our children to have the confidence to move forward in modern 21st-century britain that is what all the parents who have come to see me in the last few weeks want and why they wanted me to be in the debate ", "no because i wish to give other hon members time to make their speeches it has been a real problem for parents to get a fair hearing about genuinely held religious conviction in an atmosphere that sometimes does not feel tolerant of religious beliefs most of those parents absolutely sign up to the equalities agenda particularly in the muslim community in birmingham ladywood we recognise that our status as a minority community demands that we stand up for the rights of other minority communities it has to be possible to reconcile the differing perspectives on life of different minority communities i consider it a failure of politics that we find ourselves in entrenched polarised and divisive debates where the rights of people are set against one another we in parliament the representatives of the people have not done our collective job to reconcile those rights instead we have left it to schools in birmingham in some instances that has left us in a total mess which is not acceptable some of what has been done in birmingham is not part of an early roll-out of relationships education for primary school pupils but action under the equality act 2010 as my hon friend the member for warrington north mentioned the equality act sets out several protected characteristics nobody disagrees with the protection of those characteristics but it is a fact of our modern politics the culture war that we are all living through that those protected characteristics conflict with one another in some cases for example there is no point talking about biological sex and gender identity with children because the adults of our country cannot  decide what the exact relationship between the two is those two protected characteristics are clearly in contested territory who decides how we navigate that contested territory and draw a line that does justice by competing groups it must be parliament it cannot simply be left to teachers or state officials acting in other capacities such as in prisons or schools there has to be a negotiated settlement led by the government with input from every part of parliament there must be an acceptance that in a diverse society we must pitch at negotiated settlements between different groups in which most people can come to a compromise because they are the greatest thing that we have to offer in the absence of anybody willing to play that role i do not blame parents for saying that they want to opt their kids out because the subject has become so divisive and polarising that they cannot see another way out without any arbitration mechanism or protection for those of us at the unfashionable end of the faith spectrum in orthodox religious communities i am an orthodox muslim whenever there is a conflict about rights everybody feels it is okay to ride roughshod over orthodox communities and push them to one side i do not believe the government have the right to legislate for the calling of an individual\u2019s conscience i ask the minister to take that point away unless he can come up with a system that ensures fairness between competing rights he must give way and allow a right to withdraw ", "the prime minister said this morning in setting up today\u2019s vote that we that is to say parliament must not  let the country down the real tragedy is that ever since the prime minister assumed her position and began the process of implementing brexit her way of handling the process has done exactly that it has let the country down a vote won by 52% to 48% required the language of compromise from the government and the prime minister at the outset not the language of red lines we are a divided nation that is not surprising given that we asked our citizens to answer a binary question in a highly polarising and toxic debate no genuine attempt has been made to reach out to the 48% to bring people together and to tell those who found themselves in a minority by a very small margin on the day of the referendum result that this is still their country too no attempt has been made to state unequivocally that all those citizens who have been exercising their british rights and freedoms to dissent to hold an unpopular or minority position and to still argue for remain are not acting as saboteurs or traitors but are as british as it gets instead we have allowed toxic language and rhetoric to take hold poisoning not only our politics but our wider society just as there has been no reaching out to the rest of the country by the government there has been no reaching out to the rest of the house either at the outset of his speech which feels a long time ago the attorney general said that we have reached this point reluctantly that is not true all the choices made along the way choices made willingly and wilfully by the prime minister have led us not reluctantly but inexorably to the place we are in today it is unforgivable that we have lost a whole month to a simple running down of the clock because the prime minister was afraid of losing the vote as she will inevitably this evening anyway i cannot support the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration for many of the reasons that members have already set out not least because they ignore 80% of our economy the services sector on which so many thousands of jobs depend i will however support all and any measures that allow parliament to do what the executive have so demonstrably failed to do which is to commence the  search for a consensus we should hold some indicative votes to find what will command a majority in the house we must take all and any steps to rule out a no-deal brexit the real tragedy is that brexit on any terms will not solve many of the reasons why the brexit vote took place in the first place at the very least we as a house must make the best of it and find a consensus to go forward ", "i thank all hon members who have contributed to the debate as well as the minister for not closing his mind to the idea of a national-level response and a new licensing regime for shisha bars i take on board what he says about requiring a high threshold to be passed before somebody\u2019s business can be closed members of my family and my friends and constituents who go to well-run shisha places and have a nice time out will not thank me for getting their lovely venue which they enjoy shut down i am not a killjoy and i am not trying to get rid of good businesses and establishments my concern is focused on where things go wrong and at the moment i cannot accept that we have what is needed to head off such problems before they start affecting residents in the way that many in my community have been affected i take on board what the minister said about thresholds that must be crossed and we must ensure that we have fully considered all the measures currently available i hope that on further reflection and given that he does not have a closed mind on the matter i will be able to persuade him and his colleagues that a licensing regime is necessary normal nightclubs can become troubled premises because they attract the attention of gangs or protection rackets we know those things happen i take on board the minister\u2019s point that there is no silver bullet but there is a whole world of activity before we get to the serious end of the spectrum that a licensing regime could take into account i will certainly take up the minister\u2019s offer of a roundtable particularly by engaging with council officials from across the country who have a wealth of knowledge on these matters ", "i am mrs main i am not an expert on how these matters play out in devolved administrations but they obviously need a voice because they face different regimes i will take up the minister\u2019s offer and i hope we will get to have greater knowledge about shisha establishments the impact they can have and how best they can be regulated question put and agreed to resolved that this house has considered reforming the regulation of shisha lounges sitting suspended ", "from the work that i have done and from engaging with birmingham city council i know that council officers who deal with shisha issues in local authorities where it is a problem are already in contact with one another they know each other well and get together regularly to share best practice so it happens already i appreciate what the minister has said so far i guess what i was explaining from my experience which i hope has been noted a bit more than the minister\u2019s speech has signalled is that the current rules have too many gaps unless there is alcohol nothing can be done it is too difficult to get action where there is a licence for alcohol but if there is no alcohol licence it still takes too long of the three shisha bars in my constituency that were closed two did not have licences for alcohol i hope that he will reflect on that ", "i beg to move that this house has considered reforming the regulation of shisha lounges it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mrs main i am delighted to have secured this debate in a week in which ministers have been held in contempt of parliament for the first time ever and we have had ongoing and various crises related to the handling of brexit talking about the regulation of shisha premises might seem a little niche i have found myself educating many colleagues about what shisha is and about the problems relating to shisha premises in the affected communities central to this debate is how we as citizens navigate community life together balancing the social and entertainment needs of some against the needs of residents and whether we can take effective action when things go wrong residents affected by issues relating to shisha lounges such as those in my constituency and other areas including westminster brent ealing preston manchester and many of our other core cities can attest to the fact that when things go wrong they face the misery of noise nuisance crime antisocial behaviour and everything that goes with that for them this is definitely not a niche issue it affects communities profoundly i should explain what shisha is and what form these premises take shisha which is also known as a water pipe hubble-bubble smoking or a hookah is a way of smoking tobacco through a bowl and a pipe or a tube the tobacco is often mixed with other flavours such as mint coconut or pineapple i have seen every variety going the tobacco is burned and then the vapour or smoke passes through a water basin before inhalation it is a social activity people do it in groups it is not dissimilar to going out for a night at the cinema or any other kind of entertainment activity people go out for a night of shisha smoking i am not exactly sure where shisha smoking originated but it is common in parts of the middle east africa and asia in recent years it has become much more popular in the uk i have been aware of shisha places in birmingham for some years but there has been a proliferation of establishments there over the past five years it is a growing trend in our major cities i have never smoked shisha or any kind of cigarette and i cannot personally see the attraction of it but many of my constituents friends and acquaintances enjoy it as a night out and regularly go to a shisha lounge bar or caf\u00e9 these establishments are much more varied than might be assumed one of the stereotypical assumptions about what shisha premises look like is that they are typically some sort of middle eastern caf\u00e9 with a middle eastern food menu and d\u00e9cor that is indicative of some sort of middle eastern origin almost tent-like certainly some establishments fit that stereotype but there are also many huge venues swish swanky establishments that are often spread out over a number of floors in buildings that may previously have been warehouses they look and feel like any other major nightclub or similar attraction in a major city in my constituency and across birmingham i have seen that the clientele of those establishments is much more cosmopolitan than might be assumed it might be thought that this activity is primarily enjoyed by people from black and minority ethnic communities but it is much wider that is partly because some of those establishments do not sell alcohol some do but some do not and make a virtue of offering an alcohol-free space for people who wish to enjoy it that fills a gap in the market for young muslims in particular who want to go out and have a good time just like anybody else but want to be in an alcohol-free space there has also been an increase in the number of 16 to 24-year-olds across all communities and social classes who do not drink alcohol entrepreneurial businessmen and women are trying to fill the demand in the market by opening up these types of venues which do not serve alcohol but provide a night-time entertainment offer for different sections of the community many shisha establishments serve food food is a key part of their offer many double up as dessert places another type of venue that has proliferated where people can get milkshakes that contain three days\u2019-worth of their recommended calorie intake and smoke shisha at the same time some are modest caf\u00e9s and others are much more like nightclubs across birmingham the number of establishments of various different forms has grown over the past few years as a member of parliament a resident and a citizen of my city i was aware that these venues were growing in popularity but i had not come across the issues that affect local people when one opens up until i did a coffee morning in my constituency in the summer of 2016 i expected it to be a normal coffee morning when the issues we would expect were raised but every resident who came wanted to talk about the problems they were facing as a result of a shisha lounge opening directly opposite their small housing estate it related to a shisha lounge called arabian nites which has featured much in birmingham news over the past few months the stories that my residents shared with me were horrendous they said that a nightclub had opened directly opposite their houses and they were powerless to do anything to stop the issues they faced as a result some residents had been attacked and some had woken up to find patrons of the establishment urinating in their front gardens in one case as they were getting ready to take their children to school in the morning the noise nuisance was so bad that they could never open their windows at night not even in the peak heat of summer and even with their windows shut the noise disturbance was pretty high parking became a total nightmare and there was partying till the early hours people told me that their community had been ruined one of the saddest things is that in that area there are lots of council housing tenants who have lived there for decades and are the absolute backbone of the local community they have been there through thick and thin and have seen lots of changes to their community but they love their community and the place where they live ", "i am grateful to my hon friend the member for manchester gorton (afzal khan) for his intervention i know that a lot of work has been done in manchester i will come on to some of the public health issues he is right to raise public health concerns there are of course public health duties on local authorities and the public health risks relating to shisha are not well understood and publicised he is absolutely right that much more awareness is needed i congratulate manchester for the good work it has done in this area the common life of those residents and the community they created which they love and have thrived in for all these years was being ruined some of those stalwart residents the absolute backbone of the community told me that they wanted to leave and were desperate to move out in fact they most wanted my help with council housing transfers i thought that was one of the saddest things because those people are the lifeblood of the area if they move out we will lose something much more profound in the community it was all because they simply could not tolerate the daily misery they were facing because of the shisha venue as people became more vocal with their complaints i took up the issues and worked with the council and the police who were doing their best to manage the fallout from the venue opening near my residents and there was more media coverage in the birmingham post and the birmingham mail residents became worried about reprisals from patrons of the venue suddenly it became much more of a hot topic things then took a more serious and frightening turn because gun violence and other serious crime was taking place people were up in arms but also terrified i was shocked that almost overnight a community could be ruined by a shisha place opening as the local member of parliament i initially treated this as a policing matter it is interesting that other parliamentarians and council leaders have tended to raise it with home office ministers as a policing issue i too talked to the police we thought about having more policing patrols and possible interventions but eventually i had to conclude that the law itself makes things complicated in this area my thought was  just take away the shisha licence because that is the business  model on which the premises are based take it away and they will not have a business and will soon move on but of course there is no licence for shisha in the case of arabian nites it took a couple of serious incidents involving gun discharges one discharge ricocheted and hit a passer-by before the police could apply for a closure order under antisocial behaviour rules such closure orders are temporary and the one for arabian nites was for only three months the venue has not reopened but it is free to do so once it has met the new conditions ", "my hon friend the shadow minister is absolutely right the process is too difficult and onerous i have a copy of the documentation put together at huge cost in time and resource by the police in support of the application for a closure order it is more than 100 pages long i was trying to print it before coming to the chamber so that i could show it to everyone but my printer broke given the amount of work and number of witness statements required of police officers in the first case against arabian nites the police did not get the closure order and had to apply a second time meanwhile my residents who live with that place directly opposite their homes are terrified of gun violence of stepping outside late at night and even of taking their kids to the school around the corner the regime is too onerous and to rely simply on existing police powers is not good enough i have nothing but praise by the way for the way that the police have tried to engage with the issue they have done their best with the avenues open to them in birmingham a total of three such establishments have been subject to closure orders all three happen to be in my constituency arabian nites which i have mentioned cloud nine which was closed after the suspected sale of laughing gas to children as young as nine and following breaches of fire safety and venue capacity limits and the emperors lounge which was closed after a murder was linked to the premises but which has since reopened after a three-month closure order as the law stands shisha smoking is subject to the ban on smoking in public places alongside all other smoking in the uk it is subject to the same rules shisha is a tobacco product so it is subject to the same rules that apply to regular tobacco in particular the ban on sales to those under 18 when it comes to licensing legislation however the licensing act covers only the sale of alcohol and certain forms of regulated entertainment shisha bars or lounges do not require a licence under regulation unless they sell alcohol or have other regulated entertainment under the 2003 act some establishments sell alcohol arabian nites was selling alcohol which was one of the bases on which the police and the council were eventually able to take action but cloud nine and the emperors lounge did not have licences for the sale of alcohol instead falling within the other regulated activities under the licensing  act no single agency or piece of statutory legislation regulates shisha activities if serious incidents occur shootings or serious violence such as i have had in my constituency the police may apply for the powers available to them under antisocial behaviour rules such as a three-month closure order as we have seen in birmingham however that process takes a lot of time and effort furthermore many premises will fight their corner with what is available to them through the legal system it is fair to say too that many will do whatever they can to frustrate the legal process keeping the thing running for as long as possible in order to beat everyone down and evade the enforcement action being sought ", "i will develop that point i absolutely acknowledge that shisha lounges are often small businesses but a lot of the troubled premises are not the average small business they are big venues and very lucrative i have learnt a lot more about shisha than i ever anticipated when i first became a member of parliament and the biggest establishments can afford to have personal appearances by celebrities it is not unusual to find boxers or instagram stars visiting such places putting in a personal appearance in the same way as they might for a new nightclub or members\u2019 club opening in any city across the country there is a distinction to be drawn between the much smaller operations which are more similar to a caf\u00e9 with the added ability to offer shisha smoking to its patrons and the big ones that are much more like nightclubs the legal tests in existing legislation are onerous and there is a balance to be struck in ensuring that people can have a viable business and not be shut down on spurious grounds or unfairly police and council officers are cognisant of their legal responsibilities and do not want to drive away good businesses but i believe them when they tell me in my conversations with them that some of the most troubled establishments employ high-powered lawyers and do everything they can to frustrate the process that happens right at the beginning of the process at the planning stage they set up as a caf\u00e9 or restaurant and add other things as they go along developing the shisha business there are many ways around the system as well as many gaps which some individuals are keen to exploit because this is a lucrative business in london westminster city council in particular i am pretty sure it is westminster so i hope i have got that right has led work looking at tobacco duty which is often not paid on imported shisha so there  are tax implications as well i do not want to make out that these are all bad businesses they are not but where people flout rules and regulations they do so in a  considered and planned way they know what they are doing so it is right to weight the law and to make the thresholds in the legal process that have to be crossed more favourable to residents because when it goes wrong as it did for the people of highgate in my constituency it is horrendous it ruins lives and breaks communities and that is too high a price for local residents to pay for the sake of the business needs of some of the shisha establishments in birmingham we have 37 premises many of them concentrated in my constituency but with some in other parts of the city that is only the ones that we know about 37 premises known to birmingham city council with no specific licence requirement for shisha many places open without any recourse to any of the authorities whatever as i said the numbers have grown rapidly the highest concentrations of shisha premises are found in the london boroughs of westminster ealing and brent while birmingham has the highest concentration outside of london the statutory provisions around fire risk indoor smoking the sale of tobacco to minors and the non-payment of tobacco duty which i mentioned are regularly frustrated the sanctions available under tobacco-related laws are not acting as a deterrent that is certainly our experience in birmingham the fire risks are considerable in birmingham alone we have had six major fires over the last five years that is not surprising when one drills down into the situation because within those premises there is a high number of ignition sources combustible material and often low staff awareness of fire safety and some of the venues are situated in hard to get to places or are big and spread out over a number of floors which poses a risk in and of itself a business sector that is relatively small in number suffering six big fires in a five-year period is indicative of a much wider problem other local authorities are also greatly concerned about the fire risks something that i thought about when drilling down into the issue the minister might raise this himself was whether it was simply a case of the different agencies not working effectively together could it be that although the law annoyingly is not all neatly in one place and the powers are spread across different acts of parliament it can be used creatively and effectively to bring the problem under control after two years of dealing with these issues i can say that it is not a case of the agencies not coming together i have seen nothing but good practice at birmingham city council and i pay tribute to janet bradley who has taken the lead on shisha issues and all of her team there they have worked with all the other teams across the council they have worked with partner agencies and they have worked very closely with the police to whom i also pay tribute for all their work particularly on getting closure orders that is the case not just in birmingham westminster city council too has published a strategy held a symposium and got everybody with any interest whether public health fire safety or policing the whole picture into a room together to create a strategy for them to deal with the problem as far as the law currently allows brent council either won an award or was shortlisted for one for its work in preparing its strategy in the commons debate pack produced by the library there was an article that i had not seen before in which brent council\u2019s leader who wrote to the home secretary  about the problem in 2017 called some of the shisha establishments in brent  lawless places that attracted drug-dealing and sex-trafficking it is not for want of trying by different local authorities run by different political parties where people have tried to grasp the issue and find a way to cut through and get enforcement action quickly and effectively but no matter how much good work is done in truth it takes a disproportionate amount of time to take action with the available powers and resources the time has come to enhance the legislative framework surrounding shisha premises and i believe institute a licensing regime specifically for shisha premises that would allow local authorities to license shisha premises to operate in their area and make it illegal for a shisha premises to operate unless it was licensed it is important to go after the shisha aspect of the entertainment offer of those premises because that is the basis on which the business model operates those venues are not interested in being your average caf\u00e9 or restaurant the shisha is key it is lucrative it is absolutely essential to the business model that activity rather than anything else that might be included and covered by licensing regulations needs to be licensed now the first aim of the licensing regime would be to reduce the detrimental impact on communities that must be at the heart of any such regime\u2019s objectives it must ensure that premises do not cause a public nuisance along with all the other crime and disorder issues that i have highlighted there is also space for the raising of hygiene standards and for safeguarding policies to restrict the admission of under-18s that is not something that i have focused on particularly in my work in birmingham but i often see college-age students under-18s going to those venues and it is pointless to have age limits in law if they are openly flouted in that way a licensing regime would give us the opportunity to put those policies in place we need to have sanctions for non-compliance that cannot be frustrated by the company changing name which often happens even when we do have absolute clarity on the ownership and management of the business there are problems for example when the police obtained closure orders for the three venues in my constituency it was normal when they or council officers turned up for people who clearly worked in those establishments to say that they did not work there and did not know who the owner was many of the venues do not even have a postal address because like some other problem night-time economy venues they evade postal contact that sounds like a small issue but it frustrates council officers\u2019 or police officers\u2019 ability to contact those responsible when trying to fulfil their legal duties and from day one that stops them taking effective action following discussions with officers at birmingham city council and others i conclude that there are three ways in which we could pursue a licensing regime for shisha premises the best and most workable solution would be to make an amendment to the local government (miscellaneous provisions) act 1982 which would simply state that we are going to control shisha premises that amendment should provide for an adoptive licensing regime that gives flexibility to local authorities so that they can set local controls to deal with the issues that they face in their areas that is important because  problems take different forms according to the locality in which the shisha lounge is located on edgware road for example problems in connection with shisha premises are of the same order but play out slightly differently from those in highgate in my constituency an adoptive regime that gives flexibility to local authorities is the best way forward taking a similar approach to that which has been taken on sex entertainment venues that gives local authorities powers to set local controls and in doing so puts local people back in the game and gives them a say on what happens in their local area i believe that is the change that best lends itself to a licensing regime for shisha premises many of the standard terms that apply in other licensing regimes would be easily transferable to a shisha regime which would comprise all of the standard enforcement actions that flow from licensing regimes the key ultimate power would be the ability to revoke a business\u2019s licence and thereby put it out of business rather than providing an opportunity for it to come back in some other shape or form if we do not go down the road of an amendment to the 1982 act there are two other ways that i and others consider that a change might be made another way of trying to control shisha premises is to strengthen the current provisions of the health act 2006 and the smoke-free (premises and enforcement) regulations 2006 current regulations stipulate how enclosed a space has to be in order to comply with the legislation obviously there must be proper ventilation and so on some premises earning good money can install a retractable roof when somebody goes to conduct a check the roof is off so it looks like there is adequate ventilation as required under the regulations the roof of course goes straight back on as soon as the officer has left the building because offering shisha outdoors in the cold weather or in the rain will massively affect the business model it is not tenable to assume that the 2006 regulations are being regularly complied with in some of those establishments we could try to find a way around that but in the end i concluded that trying to draft something that closes all the loopholes in the legislation and covers the ways some problematic shisha premises operate would not achieve the desired effect i also considered whether it would be possible to reach an agreement on an interpretation of the local government declaration on tobacco for local authorities with public health duties an interpretation could be added that councils cannot allow any kind of licence for businesses with a model that gains money from people smoking the public health duty is to try to reduce the risk of harm from smoking i am not an official draftswoman but i did not think that would work i played around with two other possibilities before deciding that the 1982 act is the way forward following advice from janet bradley and the officer team at birmingham city council and having consulted other local authorities that face this issue i concluded that the cleanest and most effective way of dealing with the problem is to adopt a licensing regime under the 1982 act i would be delighted if the minister stood up and said  yes you\u2019re absolutely right we will get on this straightaway if that does not happen i would like him and his officials to have an open mind about the licensing regime and at least to commit to exploring what changes under the 1982 act might look like there is a wealth of experience across local government and  from other parliamentarians in this house some colleagues are waiting to speak in the brexit debate in the main chamber and could not be here that the minister could draw on which hopefully will convince him that there is a problem that needs a solution and that this is the best solution on offer following the point made by my hon friend the member for manchester gorton about public health shisha smoking is as harmful as normal tobacco smoking if not more so people still think that the smoke is much less harmful because it goes through the water filtration system before being inhaled the world health organisation and other organisations that have researched this are clear in one hour on a shisha pipe a person can take in as much tobacco as if they had smoked 100 cigarettes the health implications of large numbers of our population smoking shisha on a regular basis cannot be underestimated local authorities have a public health duty places such as manchester westminster and birmingham are trying to do what they can to raise awareness of the public health implications of shisha but piecemeal work by good people in good local authorities is not the way forward the work should be led at ministerial level at least to convene a roundtable to get the right people in the room to think about how we might do more together through central government and to raise awareness of the harm of shisha smoking we are storing up future public health problems for ourselves i would be grateful if the minister shared his thoughts on that my absolute ask as i have said throughout my speech is for a licensing regime for shisha the residents in my community have suffered greatly because of the gaps in the current system it has taken us too long to get temporary action that is not good enough my residents deserve better a licensing regime is the best way to deal with the problem once and for all ", "whether he plans to increase

end in response to the budget the director of the institute for fiscal studies said if i were a prison governor a local authority chief executive or a headteacher i would struggle to find much to

really believed the rhetoric behind the programme when they set it up that it was about making work pay and all those high ideals they and the secretary of state in particular would show some humility

not compassionate that is not humane and that is not moral i urge the secretary of state to reflect on the attitude she is displaying to the house our constituents and the country in the way that she

genuinely to learn lessons and make the programme better instead the government said that talk of cuts was somehow  fake news the secretary of state then had to admit that people are going to be worse off we have heard the figures of \u00a3200 a month and \u00a32 400 a year being mooted that is a staggering sum of money to lose every year for the working poor and the vulnerable in our community we know that the self-employed will potentially be up to \u00a32 500 a year worse off compared with those who are not self-employed under the new system these are the realities that the government cannot deny that is not fake news that is just the truth the government and the dwp said to the national audit office this was recorded in its most recent report that the organisations at the coalface of helping our constituents to deal with the troubles they face because of universal credit whether the trussell trust other people who run foodbanks or local government which is now facing much higher levels of rent arrears than previously are motivated by a desire to lobby for changes rather than accurately reflect what is happening on the ground that is a disgraceful attitude for the department to take towards organisations that yes may well have a different vision for how they think the social security system should work but are absolutely telling the truth about the destitution and difficulties our constituents are facing i invite the secretary of state and any of her ministers to come and spend a day in my constituency office and to see the explosion in our case load that has been created by the roll-out of universal credit my staff spend most of their time every single day on the phone trying to sort out difficulties arising from universal credit i shall highlight just two cases we have had recently the first regarding delayed payments the government say they are taking action on that but i have a constituent who has not received any money since 12 july he has no money for food fuel or anything i invite the secretary of state to intervene and tell me what i should tell him about where he should get some money to try to survive while his universal credit is being sorted out ", "i wish it was just one case i would happily bring them all to the minister and he can tell me how i should respond to my constituents but my experience of engaging with the department on this matter is not a happy one if he wants to become the constituency caseworker for the whole of the house for universal credit cases he will be a very busy man in fact it would be easier for him to improve the system and fund it properly so that people are not forced into destitution in the first place there is a particular difficulty in my constituency relating to constituents with autism and other mental health conditions moving on to universal credit often  because they have failed the assessment they had previously been in receipt of employment and support allowance having not been supported as they tried to navigate a very complicated online system the support that is available is simply not enough i invite the government and the minister in that spirit to revisit some of those issues because they are not ones that he will be hearing from me for the first time in this context it beggars belief that the government wish to continue with managed migration there is only one fair humane and compassionate thing that they could do for all the people facing difficulty under the system stop the roll-out and try to genuinely engage and fix the problems of universal credit right now before they move on most importantly however they need to fund it properly because this is a vehicle for cuts they know it we all know it and our constituents are paying the

am grateful to the hon gentleman for making that point but as we all know in this place there are always the usual channels for discussions to be had and if there was ever a moment for the usual channels and for discussions to be had i would say that in resolving this most important national matter this would be the time it is open to the government at any point to work with those of us who want the paperwork released so that we can get to the bottom of what happened and truly learn lessons and move forward in a way that would honour the windrush generation and put right what they have suffered that is what needs to happen i welcome the move today to provide legal certainty about how the windrush generation will be treated in their future applications but i ask home office ministers to consider giving those citizens access to legal aid and good-quality legal advice as they try to regularise their status i say that because the absence of legal aid has pushed people towards rapacious and terrible solicitors who give bad advice and because simply saying  we have put this on a legal footing and now you can trust the home office is not enough for people who are still too scared to come forward the government have lost the trust of a generation i know people who despite my personal assurances are still too afraid to come forward a simple legal and legislative change will not be enough they need access to independent legal advice and they need financial help for the purpose i shall make a couple of general remarks on illegal immigration some conservative members attempted to ask the opposition  what would you do about illegal immigration we dishonour the windrush  generation if we make this a debate about illegal immigration and if we miss the point about the culture of disbelief that fuels the hostile environment which as the scandal has shown sits at the heart of what has happened it is that culture of disbelief that renders british citizens and british nationals as if they were not just immigrants but illegal too it visits upon them the ignominy and humiliation of being deemed illegal in their own land that assumption which is made at the heart of our system does not simply go after illegal immigrants as we have said it goes after those of us who look like we could be immigrants we have talked a lot about illegal immigration sitting at the heart of this debate but what we are not talking about so much is race i say to hon members who do not quite understand how these policies impact on their fellow citizens and their fellow british nationals try making an application to the home office while having a name that is demonstrably african in origin try making an application as a british national to the home office with a name that is demonstrably south asian in origin i promise that the protection of a british passport will not help one little bit people will have visited upon them casual humiliation upon humiliation the system will treat them as if they were dirt on the bottom of its shoe and that is not good enough that happens to british nationals on a daily basis when they apply for visitor visas or spousal visas if they can get past the income threshold and prove the legitimacy of their love for somebody they fallen in love with and married the system still makes them take a dna test to prove that a child who might have been born while they visited their foreign-based spouse is in fact their child that is not acceptable in 21st-century britain i say to government members do not be complacent about what your system is doing on a daily basis to people that have the protection of a british passport if you are in any doubt come to see me in my constituency which is 70% non-white i have one of the highest immigration caseloads in this country and i see this daily if you have illusions about this i suggest that you disabuse yourselves of them straightaway this is a moment of national truth of clarity it is a moment when we can make a choice to have a better debate about immigration it is a moment that we must not allow to be missed we will honour the windrush generation if we move forward in a way that is humane that is compassionate and that acknowledges the truth of the failures at the heart of our system and seeks to put them right ", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department

world and their persecution is not a recent phenomenon it is of long standing people are being rendered stateless in their own land if they are not being beaten murdered or raped they are being

leadership i hear the argument saying that she does not have power that this country is transitioning to democracy that she has to tread a fine line and that there is a fear of overthrow by the military leadership but the compromise of transition to democracy cannot come at the cost of turning a blind eye to ethnic cleansing that is abhorrent and a total corruption of democracy and everything that democracy stands for there is an idea that aung san suu kyi has no power but for many years not only did she have no power but she did not have liberty yet she used the one power she did have the power of her voice the power to speak out and now she has fallen silent and brought her nobel peace prize into disrepute if she has not been utterly silent all she has done is to act as an apologist for the military regime and to deny the truth of the crisis that has fallen upon the rohingya in burma the point about aung san suu kyi raising her voice is so important because she must stand up and make the argument for democracy democracy is not the tyranny of the majority having a vote and persecuting a minority it is founded on the principle that human rights are universal and the universality of human rights must be accepted in myanmar if it is ever going to be a democracy worthy of the name that is the argument that aung san suu kyi could and should make and we in this

will let him off on this occasion because that was a first-rate start to his parliamentary career and i wish him all the very best i want to focus my remarks on the government\u2019s record and their failure on their own terms i note with interest that the government benches are all but empty that may be because government back benchers are not exactly lining up to defend the increase in national insurance given the row that has erupted between no 10 and no 11 downing street but the reason may go back further than that long before the government\u2019s broken manifesto commitment on national insurance the government failed the test they set for themselves their central mission when they came into government in 2010 and the one promise they made to this country was that they would eliminate the deficit in five years and that the age of austerity was the only way to achieve it the budget documents are clear in 2016-17 i am glad more government members are coming into the chamber so they can hear about their government\u2019s failure on the deficit in person the deficit will be  \u00a351 7 billion in 2017-18 it will be \u00a358 3 billion even in 2021-22 it will still be \u00a316 8 billion on this trajectory the deficit will not be eliminated until 2025-26 a full 15 years after their famous promise made in 2010 to eliminate the deficit in five years that is the true shameful record of this government but it sits alongside a much starker and more catastrophic reality on living standards for ordinary working people [interruption ] government members should stop chuntering and listen to what they have done to ordinary working people on current forecasts average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007 that amounts to 15 years without a pay rise for ordinary working people according to the resolution foundation by 2020 families will have missed out on pay growth of \u00a312 000 the worst decade in 210 years that is what the government have delivered for ordinary working people country they used to taunt us on the labour benches with a slogan about us not fixing the roof while the sun was shining for people going 15 years without a pay rise it is as if the sun never shone at all on pay wages jobs and growth i was particularly disappointed that the government failed to take action to offset the planned cuts to universal credit later in this parliament i say to conservative members who rightly kicked up such a fuss on the changes to tax credits planned by the former chancellor of the exchequer that the u-turn was not truly a u-turn the cuts are still coming down the tracks many of the same people will be affected when those currently on tax credits are moved on to universal credit towards the end of this parliament at the moment only 170 000 or so people are in receipt of universal credit by the end of this parliament millions of families will be on universal credit the secretary of state\u2019s warm words on opportunity mean nothing given what the government are doing to the working poor the cuts to work allowances will total \u00a36 4 billion by the end of this parliament only a tiny concession was given at the autumn statement by the chancellor when he reduced the taper rate from 65% to 63% it remains the case that lone parents on the national living wage with one child in 2021 earning \u00a316 000 will lose \u00a32 800 the measures in the autumn statement will give them back only \u00a3200 of that money so they will be \u00a32 600 a year worse off those are not small sums they are the difference between keeping a roof over your head and being homeless they are the difference between putting food on the table or watching the children go hungry that record of delivery that the government are putting on the people of our country in the 21st century is unacceptable in the end politics is always about choices and priorities this government have made the choice to cut corporation taxes totalling \u00a311 2 billion by 2021-22 they could have made a different choice they could have chosen to spend that money elsewhere perhaps on universal credit or social care or to alleviate the crisis in the national health service this is a choice that they are making it is not the case that cuts to corporation tax are necessary to ensure that we have job growth in our country we have seen what has happened to wages and we know that business investment is nowhere near where it should be the cuts to corporation tax are therefore being pocketed as profit more than they are delivering for the rest of the economy they should be reconsidered the government\u2019s choices thus far have made ordinary people pay the price which is unacceptable ", "to ask the secretary of

should like to congratulate my right hon friend the member for doncaster north (edward miliband) and the hon member for stratford-on-avon (nadhim zahawi) on securing this debate i agreed with the entirety of my right hon friend the member for doncaster north\u2019s speech and with much of what the hon member for stratford-on-avon said although i disagree with his more fulsome praise for the actions of this government over the past 48 hours i would take issue with that but i was very moved by his personal experiences and his personal reaction to the ban i commend his speech and his efforts on this matter i want to return to a point made when the foreign secretary was taking questions earlier following his statement about the importance of recognising that this is a muslim ban other members have made that point as well but it is so important that we send a clear message and that we call it exactly what it is we seem to be living in an era when the truth and facts are challenged at every moment i was struck by a recent film  denial which is the story of how professor deborah lipstadt had to take the holocaust denier david irving to court  in order to prove the truth about the holocaust it really focuses the mind on the importance of speaking up for the truth at every moment and calling out those who deny it many people are trying to divert us from the truth by saying that this executive order is about nationality it is not about nationality the president of the united states made it very clear in his campaign that he wanted to ban muslims from entering the united states rudy giuliani was on fox news recently not one of those organisations that the president likes to accuse of distributing  fake news saying that he had been asked by the president of the united states to put together a commission to work out how to enact the muslim ban legally these people are not hiding in plain sight they are telling us in clear words on national television that is broadcast around the world exactly what they believe exactly what they stand for and exactly who they are ", "i am grateful to the right hon gentleman for making that important point and reminding us about humayun khan in normal circumstances that action would have been enough to ensure that someone lost an election and received the opprobrium of everyone everywhere it is a sign of what we have come to that that did not happen it is important that we stick to our principles and that we hold the line in relation to the truth because that is what is at stake here everyone in this house must be unashamed and unafraid to do that we have to hold the line when people scream at us on social media that things are not as they seem and that the president suddenly changed his mind and does not think that it is a muslim ban we also have to hold the line when people try to divert us and when the  alt-right go on the marches they are now so famous for we have to hold on to the truth ", "i will not because of the time i do apologise i want to make a point about british values as a british muslim parliamentarian i have spoken a lot in this house about british values i have also heard a lot from this government about british values in fact i have often felt that the government feel that the british muslim community needs to do more to uphold those values we have heard famous phrases such as  muscular liberalism and we have been told that we need to give strong and vocal support to our respect for democracy the rule of law equality and tolerance for everyone and every group in this country we are told that we as a community have to step up to the plate and call out behaviours that do not match with our british values if we as a community fail to do that we have the threat of the prevent strategy hanging over us as i watched the prime minister\u2019s limp weak and shameful response to  this muslim ban i hope i can be forgiven for wondering whether the british government would consider referring themselves to their own prevent strategy for failing to provide that strong vocal muscularly liberal defence of our british values i am reminded of the recent casey review of integration in our communities one of whose recommendations was held up by the secretary of state for communities and local government it stated that we could increase standards of leadership and integrity in public office by\u2026ensuring that british values such as respect for the rule of law equality and tolerance are enshrined in the principles of public life and developing a new oath for holders of public office i wonder how many members of the government would feel if they had taken such an oath that they had fulfilled that promise by calling out this behaviour on the part of the american president in the way that they should have done i feel that they have not fulfilled any such promise and that they have therefore undermined the very case that they make for our own values that is a real shame i have a final point about the personal impact that the ban is having on muslims around the world particularly the almost 3 million british muslim citizens as a british muslim i can tell you mr speaker that people among my family friends and community feel terrified they fear that this is a portent of what is to come we live in an age of supremacists whether the muslim supremacists of isil or the white supremacists who think they have achieved their life\u2019s dream with the new administration in the white house supremacists are on the rise around the world in this age of supremacists and their success we have a duty to call them out to stand up to them and to say  not on our watch we have a duty to provide comfort and security to all our minority communities we will not let them down we will not stand by we will stand up and be counted ", "this order does not stigmatise just on the basis of nationality as the secretary of state says it does it stigmatises on the basis of faith

take an interest on their behalf but i have a more personal interest as my family originates from kashmir all four of my grandparents were born in kashmir before my family moved to this country so this debate has very personal resonance for me the hon member for bury north (mr nuttall) has already set out the background to this long-standing dispute and i pay tribute to him and to others who led the charge to secure today\u2019s backbench business debate we have heard already that this is a long-standing dispute between two nuclear-armed powers in one of the world\u2019s most heavily militarised regions it does not receive enough attention anywhere outside the region and certainly not in our own country given the size of our british kashmiri population it certainly has a lot of from that population but not enough from those outside it i therefore pay tribute to all the doughty campaigners from all parties who have taken every opportunity available to raise this serious matter in the house of commons and to press both our current government and previous governments to do more to help to build a resolution to this long-standing crisis the further push for debate on kashmir has come as a particular result of the upsurge in violence and fighting in indian-administered jammu and kashmir since last summer we see the unacceptable failure of the whole world the refusal to give effect to un resolutions and the denial of respect for the self-determination of the  kashmiri people playing out in the worst possible way people have lost hope and are rising against that loss of hope to try to force to have their rights be respected that significant upsurge in violence has elicited a brutal response from the indian authorities i am afraid that i wholeheartedly disagree with my hon friend the member for ealing southall (mr sharma) i do not believe that it is possible to minimise the extent to which the indian authorities have acted in a disproportionate manner that has significantly harmed and indeed created great tragedy for the kashmiri people in the region this is the biggest uprising in two decades and the brutality of the response of the police and security services cannot be ignored the fact that that is the case is upheld by human rights organisations across the world including human rights watch whose world report for 2017 found clear evidence that the police and security forces have acted with impunity that there have been extra-judicial killings and that mass rape has occurred all those things are not acceptable i concur with the comments made by the hon member for wycombe (mr baker) of course there will be questions about the veracity of the videos we will see on youtube on facebook and elsewhere on social media but there should be an open investigation to prove the veracity of the videos if they are true i believe that they will be found to be true there are big questions for the indian government to answer i have to say to my hon friend the member for ealing southall that the big difference between the indian government and other governments that commit human rights abuses is that india is the largest democracy in the world being a democracy is not simply about giving people a vote to decide their government it includes much more it is about fundamental respect for the rule of law and for basic human rights that must be protected and that sit alongside the ability of the people to elect their government ", "i am afraid that i would be doing other members out of their time if i gave way i apologise the use of pellet guns has been mentioned this is a significant issue for the indian government and our government must press them more on it the indian defence for the use of pellet guns to see off protestors who they say are throwing stones is that pellet guns are non-lethal of course a pellet gun will probably not kill but i defy anyone to see the pictures of the victims of pellet gun attacks and say that that is a proportionate response against civilians in a democracy it is not and i do not believe that anybody would stand up in this house and say that it is when we debate kashmir people who speak more in favour of the indian government\u2019s stance will often say that the position of those who live in jammu and kashmir is better because they are able to vote they are free to take part in the democratic process and they are basically free and that self-determination is not necessary because they are a free people freely electing their own local leaders with a significant devolution of power nobody not one person in jammu and kashmir has voted to be hurt injured beaten up raped blinded or  killed pellet wounds are brutal they are a brutal response by the indian authorities and send a brutal message to the kashmiri people they leave brutal scars which are not just carried by the individuals who bear the physical scars but are borne by the whole community in jammu and kashmir itself and all around the world by those of us of kashmiri extraction they are a symbol of the population\u2019s repression its desire to resist that repression and its cry to be heard that cry is falling on deaf ears in the largest democracy in the world which wants to do more business with the rest of the world and play a greater role in world affairs that position is simply not acceptable and our government must not shy away from making that plain especially in relation to the use of pellet guns tremendous appalling sustained and deliberate misery has been visited on  the people of kashmir for too long the stories of disappearances and the discovery of mass graves have brought no official un-led investigation whatever the police and the security forces have impunity especially given the implementation of the special powers act of 1990 if a people are humiliated abused and allowed to lose hope and offered only despair in turn and given no answers and no rights there will an uprising it is inevitable none of us as responsible legislators also working in a democracy can watch these events unfold and sit on our hands we can do more the legacy of empire demands that we do more we have a duty to speak out more regularly we have a duty to challenge as well as to encourage both the indian and the pakistani authorities i have to say to the minister that the written answers to the questions tabled particularly last summer are so bland it is as though these matters are a daily occurrence that can be ignored that is not good enough there are other disputes in this world that elicit much stronger responses from the government when members of this house table written questions that has not been the case in relation to the dispute in kashmir in particular there has been no definitive answer on whether the prime minister specifically raised the issue of human rights abuses with the indian government it is not enough to tell us that the issue of kashmir was raised we need to know whether the human rights abuses and the use of pellet guns were raised i believe that it is now incumbent upon the british government to make a clear call to raise this issue at the united nations and to ask for an independent un-led investigation into human rights abuses so that we can at least demonstrate that although some parts of this world see this as a forgotten conflict or a conflict they want to be forgotten we will never forget it and will keep fighting ", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department what geographical unit of

queen\u2019s speech debate today if only for three minutes as many people both inside and outside this house have remarked this speech has felt a bit like a damp squib or as my hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde (jonathan reynolds) said all filler and no killer perhaps that is because all eyes are on the referendum it is astonishing that the tories have been waiting for a majority government since the 1990s and have already run out of ideas by their second queen\u2019s speech that takes some doing as far as the economy is concerned the sum total of bills in this queen\u2019s speech does not add up to the comprehensive plan that would put the recovery on a more sustainable footing or allow our citizens to meet the challenges of the labour market as it is today and also more importantly as it will be in the future we are not producing enough secure well-paid jobs and the government have presided over record low pay growth so we badly needed a clear bold and comprehensive productivity plan which is totally missing from this queen\u2019s speech the chancellor has been the steward of the uk economy for the past six years but unfortunately for all of us he appears to be a one-trick pony struggling with his only trick his only real plan for the economy is deficit reduction and he continually misses his own targets we know that he failed to eliminate the deficit in the last parliament as promised and figures released by the office for national statistics on tuesday showed that the chancellor had missed his borrowing target from last year by \u00a33 8 billion with the deficit still standing at \u00a376 billion manufacturing remains 6 9% below 2008 levels and our export performance is really worrying although services continue to outperform we are still lagging behind on goods exports with the widest shortfall since records began it is worth remembering that in 2011 the chancellor said that our exports were critical to our economic growth and that he was going to double the value of exports to \u00a31 trillion and increase the number of exporters by 100 000 his record shows that exports were not even mentioned in last year\u2019s budget because there has been only a tiny increase in the value of exports since 2011 in fact the number of exporters has fallen between 2013 and 2014 the chancellor will try to blame the global cocktail of risk but many of the problems are of the government\u2019s own making because of their failure to do any serious heavy lifting in rebalancing the uk economy what we really needed from the queen\u2019s speech was a proper productivity plan not just a vague ragbag of old failed policies that the government have tried  to put together under a new label we needed a fresh start for exports so that our

the chancellor\u2019s opening speech today i could not help but reflect that he should consider a job swap with his financial secretary to the treasury who did a much better job of trying to defend the indefensible in the chamber yesterday the chancellor could have improved his performance by saying sorry sorry to all the disabled people he has frightened over the last few days but not for the first time for him sorry proved to be the hardest word on the basis of the things the chancellor does say it is clear he has a habit of saying one thing and then doing quite another he famously promised in 2010 that he would eliminate the deficit within five years but it now seems it will take him another full parliament to achieve that he said the debt would peak at 70% of gdp in 2013-14 and then fall and that our debt-to-gdp ratio would fall every year but he has missed those targets the borrowing figures out today do not make for good reading for the chancellor public sector net borrowing was higher than expected last month last week the borrowing forecast was lowered to \u00a372 2 billion but the ons tells us that borrowing so far this fiscal year from april 2015 to this february is already at \u00a370 7 billion meaning he can only borrow \u00a31 5 billion in march i very much doubt this is achievable given that in march 2015 he borrowed \u00a37 4 billion it is another target that is likely to be missed he said he would cap welfare spending but he has well and truly bust his own welfare cap last summer when he launched the productivity plan he said it would produce  world-beating productivity it is a damning indictment of that plan that the obr has significantly revised down its forecasts of our national productivity the combination of all those factors means that as a nation we are ill prepared for the global cocktail of risks that the chancellor himself has spent the last three months telling us about his habit of saying one thing and doing another is something he has been getting away with for some time but this year finally some on his own side are recoiling his iteration of that famous phrase  we\u2019re all in it together was too much for the former work and pensions secretary taking money from the disabled and cutting capital gains tax for the better-off was more than he could bear and he is not exactly a soft touch it comes to something when the government are deemed too right wing even for him the government\u2019s retreat is welcome but with it comes a hole in the budget and a scorecard that no longer adds up the scorecard already had the air of surrealism about it many people play fantasy football but it seems the chancellor plays fantasy budget the fiscal forecast for 2019-20 suggests that in one year we will go from a \u00a321 4 billion deficit to a \u00a310 4 billion surplus never mind that we will never have reduced the deficit by that much in any year since 2010 never mind that the fiscal charter introduced in october has already been broken never mind the retreat from the cuts to pip the chancellor has reigned over a litany of missed targets growth down productivity down fiscal rules broken a fantasy scorecard the resignation of the right hon member for chingford and woodford green (mr duncan smith) puts the attention squarely back where it should be on the chancellor\u2019s ability to deliver what he says he will and it has become clear especially over the last few days that he has utterly failed ", "given that the chancellor has been warning us all about the so-called global cocktail of risks and given that we learned from the budget statement that our growth forecasts are down as are those for our productivity which is fast reaching crisis point what possible justification can the minister offer considering all the other changes that have already been made to the budget for retaining the substantial cut to capital gains tax which disproportionately

of the process were more adequate and consistent and ensured that crucial characteristics such as drug problems were not missed when will the government introduce changes to the assessment process ", "like other members i have struggled to work out what is the right thing to do this evening faced with a very difficult decision as i have done with every decision regarding military action since i have been a member of this house in the last parliament i voted in favour of action in libya and in iraq in 2014 and i voted against action in syria in 2013 i know how hard it is to vote both in favour of action and against action i have learned in the five and a half years that i have been a member of this place that it is almost impossible to say with the benefit of hindsight which of those decisions was 100% right or 100% wrong having weighed up the arguments on tonight\u2019s motion i will be voting against it before i explain my reasons for that let me say that as the house knows i am a muslim those who know me well know that my belief in god and in my religion is not just a small part of my identity or simply a box that i tick on the census but the defining characteristic of my life i am a sunni too sunni born sunni raised and since i have been old enough to make my own mind up about these things a sunni by choice although there is a wide variety of opinion and practice within sunni islam we can all agree that isil is not representative of our faith and not representative of sunni muslims they are nazi-esque totalitarians who are outlaws from islam who engage in indiscriminate slaughter and who murder any muslim who does not agree with them if you are different or if you disagree you die i am well aware that under isil a muslim like myself would be killed so please believe me when i say that i do not simply want to see isil defeated i want to see it eradicated however i believe that the proposed action will not work that is why i cannot vote for it i fear primarily the chaos that might come from a vacuum or ungoverned space many members have said that airstrikes alone will not work and i agree we cannot simply bomb the ground we need a strategy to hold it as well on that point i have listened carefully to the arguments about the 70 000 moderates normally we believe that our enemy\u2019s enemy is our friend but in this case i believe that our enemy\u2019s enemy will turn out not to be our friend there are too many different groups with too many shifting allegiances and objectives ", "i agree with that point and believe that on this matter i am able to speak for the wider british muslim and british sunni community what of russia it too is acting against isil but it is also bombing the very moderates that the government will rely on to hold the ground following the airstrikes i think back to the decision regarding syria in 2013 when i feared that action against assad without a more comprehensive strategy would create a vacuum that would lead to more militancy for which we would be responsible now i believe that an isil-first strategy risks strengthening assad and creating another deeper crisis for which we would also be responsible as for our own security my instinct tells me that the threat to us will probably be the same whether we act or do not act isil will not give us a free pass if we vote against action but we will not be any more in its sights if we vote in favour of it it has been suggested in the last day or so that when the time for the apportionment of blame comes those who vote in favour of the motion will have to step forward and there will be nowhere to hide the implication is that if members vote against it as i will they can avoid the blame to those who think that way i say this if only the world were that simple there will be consequences and innocent people will die from action or inaction whatever we decide tonight we will all bear a measure of responsibility ", "i was on lesbos three weeks ago volunteering at moria camp and on the shore at sikaminia where the boats from turkey come in the conditions are appalling and the scale of the human suffering and tragedy is soul destroying every time we saw a boat all we could do was hope and pray for a safe landing there was a shocking lack of presence on the ground of official authorities and the larger international charities that one would expect to see when faced with such a crisis instead the work was left to smaller organisations and volunteer groups which are utterly overwhelmed will the secretary of state consider visiting lesbos and working with the greek authorities directly to provide british co-ordination assistance and infrastructure particularly at moria camp and sikaminia because if the rest of europe will not step up to the plate she should bypass it and go to greece directly ", "you should have paid more attention to what i was saying ", "i hesitate to be mean-spirited to the hon gentleman but it is obvious from his remarks that he was not listening to my lengthy remarks in which i set out not that there is nothing of any substance in the finance bill but that there are measures in the bill that we support and measures that we have further questions about that is different from the budget which contains measures on which we have a very real difference of opinion with the government we will test those when they come before the house in delegated legislation committees ", "i am grateful to the minister for his comments on the measures set out in the bill it is a somewhat strange finance bill because many of the most contentious measures announced in the chancellor\u2019s emergency budget are not actually in it indeed the bill is almost as significant for what is not in it as for what is it is important to reflect on that and on the fact that the budget exposed a real difference between the chancellor\u2019s rhetoric and the reality of what he is delivering particularly for ordinary working people in our country it was certainly not the budget and this is certainly not the finance bill that working people needed the institute for fiscal studies has told us that 3 million working families will be around \u00a31 000 a year worse off the budget clearly leaves working people worse off despite what the minister has said about productivity as a package it fails the test of building a more productive economy to bring down the deficit in a more sustainable stronger and fairer way the bill does not provide for the contentious changes to tax credits which the minister and i have debated several times already over the past week or two or the reduction in the work allowance and the increase in the taper rate which will hit working people on middle and lower incomes we discussed those changes during treasury questions this morning particularly the high marginal tax rates that people who earn just above the personal allowance threshold and are currently in receipt of tax credits will be facing i understand that those changes will be made by delegated legislation which we expect later this year they will be hotly debated and opposed because choosing to make 3 million working families \u00a31 000 a year worse off is the wrong choice regardless of how the government try to dress it up the bill also does not set out the changes to the minimum wage despite what the minister and the chancellor have been saying over the past week or so what the government have announced is not a real living wage ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the government have been busily trying to claim that the changes to tax credits will result in no real change because the new national living wage which is effectively only an increase in the national minimum wage will make up for that the ifs has made it clear that that is arithmetically impossible that is a pretty damning indictment of the messages that the government have been trying to put out since the budget on 8 july ", "it is quality that counts rather than quantity and labour members will show their true quality as opposed to those sitting to my left literally to my left that is on the snp benches we will of course support the measures that will bring in what is effectively the new national minimum wage but it is important to expose the fact that it is not in fact a living wage the living wage is calculated on the assumption that there will be full take-up of tax credits which is exactly what the chancellor has cut given the cut to tax credits the real living wage will be significantly higher than anything the chancellor has set out the effect of his decision is that in 2016 he will be offering the people of this country the 2011 living wage that is an important point to get on the record that is why the ifs has said that compensating ordinary working people for the loss of their tax credits with the changes on wages is arithmetically impossible ", "the hon gentleman makes a really important point taken alongside the changes to student maintenance grants and other measures the budget will leave young people particularly those from poorer backgrounds worse off it will have a real impact on their life chances as those measures are brought forward it is important that we keep holding the government\u2019s feet to the fire on the impact they are having on young people changes to the national minimum wage are normally made by statutory instrument but given the change in the name the chancellor\u2019s rebadging exercise they might need to be done by primary legislation i would be grateful if the minister explained how the government will go about making those changes if primary legislationis needed i am rather surprised that the changes are not set out in the bill it would be good to have the government\u2019s further comments on that the bill contains nothing more on productivity notwithstanding the minister\u2019s comments in his opening speech solving the productivity puzzle is absolutely imperative if we are to experience much stronger economic growth and get the deficit down more fairly the conservatives\u2019 record on productivity is one of failure given the difference between productivity in our country and in our competitors\u2019 economies i am afraid that the budget simply offered more of the same despite the chancellor\u2019s boasts the office for budget responsibility has revised productivity down next year the year after the year after that and the year after that his belated productivity plan was simply a patchwork of existing schemes rather than a substantial reform to boost skills business growth and wages the bill should also have included legislation on big infrastructure decisions which the government appear to have ducked ", "the hon gentleman raises a very important point when we debated tax credits before the budget i discussed i believe with the hon member for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) the way in which in the last recession tax credits assisted people to remain in work to accept a reduction in hours knowing that they would have the safety net of tax credits to help them through that difficult time more research is needed the government should have looked at the way in which tax credits have assisted people there is a real danger in removing tax credit support from people without having already embedded into the economy the high-skilled high-paid jobs that we all agree are needed if our economy had been transformed if the government had brought forward proposals that meant that vastly larger numbers of people were in higher-paid work there would be no need for tax credits and it would be possible to move to a system where we could phase out or decrease the support a modern economy needs a modern infrastructure but the government have pulled the plug on electrification of the railways they have pulled the rug out from under investment in renewable energy and flunked the decision on airports i was interested to see that the home secretary was very willing to take on the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip (boris johnson) when it came to water cannons the least the chancellor could have done was to take on the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip when it came to the decision on airports it would have been good to see this finance bill at least start that process ", "my hon friend raises an important point the northern powerhouse has very clearly got a power cut and it remains the case that with changes to local government funding we cannot empower local government and local people if we impoverish them at the same time there remain important critiques of the government\u2019s policy making in this area he is absolutely right that the budget the finance bill and all the attendant documents that were published on 8 july certainly did not go far enough on infrastructure and the example that he gives powerfully highlights that ", "infrastructure projects must be proceeded with on the basis of an economic case and that was the underpinning of the announcements that we made during the election campaign but it is also the case that under the hon lady\u2019s party infrastructure spending is down compared with 2010 and she should accept that the record of her government and her party on infrastructure post-2010 is certainly nothing to write home about a government who were really serious about narrowing our productivity gap would be majoring on infrastructure they certainly would not be kicking big decisions into the long grass for party political reasons and because of leadership ambitions especially when it comes to airport expansion ", "i assume that the hon gentleman will be backing the chancellor of the exchequer whom he so loyally sits behind whenever we debate the economy the budget and the finance bill have not lived up to some of the most pressing needs in our economy and instead have actively imposed a work penalty and what can only be described as a living wage con we will abstain on second reading this is a relatively short finance bill and we support a number of its measures including raising the personal tax allowance threshold and the increase in business investment particularly in respect of the annual investment allowance we will want to scrutinise some of the other measures in much greater detail we are concerned about the impact of some of the government\u2019s decisions so we will return especially in committee of the whole house to issues on bank taxation the climate change levy and the insurance premium tax ", "that was not quite the cutting put-down that the minister might have envisaged that is our position and that is what all our party will be doing today ", "that question probably sounded more cutting in the development in the hon gentleman\u2019s mind than in the delivery [interruption ] the hon member for dudley south (mike wood) chunters from a sedentary position he is welcome to intervene on me if he so wishes i will be delighted to give way to him i say to the hon member for bedford (richard fuller) and others that abstaining on second reading as he well knows because he is a veteran of debates on finance bills both in committee and in the chamber does not mean that we will not press matters to a vote later in the bill\u2019s passage indeed on the second sitting day in september we will be considering the bill in committee of the whole house where we will have tabled amendments on which we will be voting on other important measures including bank taxation the climate change levy and the insurance premium tax we can all have a lot of fun then when it comes to voting on amendments and debating them at great length ", "we will be abstaining on the reasoned amendment tabled by the scottish national party there are measures in the bill that we definitely support there are other measures that we wish to return to when the bill receives detailed scrutiny in committee of the whole house and in public bill committee and we shall return to those issues and press some to a vote on others we will table probing amendments to gain greater understanding of the government\u2019s detailed intentions ", "i do not want to get into a tit-for-tat debate with the hon gentleman but the snp did not support our reasoned amendment last night in my opinion the measured and sensible way to take the finance bill forward as we have done with previous finance bills in the previous parliament is to scrutinise it in detail there are more opportunities with finance bills because we have committee of the whole house as well as the public bill committee and we shall pressimportant measures in the bill to a vote when we reach the latter stages of the bill\u2019s passage but given that there are very important measures that we do support it is important that we signal that by allowing the bill a second reading one issue to which we will return in committee of the whole house is bank taxation the government will decrease the rate of the bank levy from january 2016 and will at the same time introduce a surcharge on profits of banks over a threshold of \u00a325 million which represents a switch from a tax on balance sheets to a tax on profits those measures are contained in clauses 16 and 17 we will debate those in detail in committee of the whole house in september when we will seek to increase transparency regarding revenues from the banking sector we will also push the government for further details about the impact that these measures will have on the diversity of the financial sector including any disproportionate impact on building societies that is one of the things that people have been warning about since the measures in the bill were unveiled as the institute for fiscal studies has highlighted by 2021 there will have been 13 tax rates in 10 years as the bank levy is gradually reduced from 0 21% to 0 1% by january 2021 this measure will cost \u00a31 8 billion from 2021 onwards because from 2021 uk banks will be taxed on liabilities in the uk and not worldwide that represents a fairly significant giveaway that it is important to test further in committee in contrast to what is happening to the bank levy the 8% corporation tax surcharge in effect on bank profits from january 2016 raises \u00a31 3 billion there are a number of questions on the rationale for moving to this form of taxation for banks as well as on the original intention of the bank levy and whether that will continue to be met in the new regime it is important that hon members have the chance to test this further in committee the minister will know that the bank levy was designed to discourage risky leverage but whether it has been successful in doing so is a matter for some debate moving to a system of having a tax on profits possibly introduces a risk that there may be some discouragement from declaring uk profits it will be important to analyse what risk that might pose in the banking sector there is a particular problem with regard to challenger banks which were not subject to the bank levy but will fall within the new surcharge challenger banks are important for the overall health of the financial sector because we need them to challenge the dominance of the big four or five banks the government will say rightly that the \u00a325 million threshold is partly designed to prevent too much of the impact from being felt by challenger banks nevertheless the government will also be aware that a lot of the commentary since publication of the proposals has focused on the genuine concerns of challenger banks which are worried that despite the \u00a325 million threshold they will still be disproportionately affected with a significant impact on consumer choice as well we will need to look at those issues further ", "i will shortly turn to insurance premium tax which is a very significant tax-raising measure that the government have not been quite as keen to trumpet as other measures in the bill as i said at the beginning of my speech i am not sure whether the hon gentleman was in the chamber it is significant that most of the very contentious changes in the budget particularly in respect of working tax credits are not in the bill but will be made in delegated legislation committees i dispute the government\u2019s characterisation of these measures because i believe that they will leave working people worse off that is not necessarily directly relevant to all aspects of the bill but it is relevant to the overall package of measures introduced in the budget there is serious concern about the impact that the 8% surcharge will have on building societies of the six main building societies nationwide yorkshire coventry skipton leeds and principality only nationwide currently pays the bank levy based on the most up-to-date profit figures from 2014-15 it is estimated that the building societies will pay about \u00a3126 million a year through the corporation tax surcharge equating to about \u00a3630 million up to 2020 the building societies point out that the primary way in which they build their capital is through retained profit so a tax on profit has a disproportionate effect on them moreover they do not have shareholders unlike public limited companies so this is in effect a tax on the customers who own them retail savers and mortgage borrowers it will be important for the government to explain their thinking on building societies and what analysis there is of how these changes will play out for them in practice the next key issue that we will return to in committee relates to the climate change levy clause 45 removes the climate change levy exemption for renewable source electricity generated on or after 1 august 2015 i am afraid that this is another example of the government undermining investor confidence in renewable energy they have already tried to halt the development of the cheapest form of clean energy by pulling the plug on onshore wind and this continues that trend it would be fair to say that since taking office they have put placating their back benchers\u2019 more strident views about renewable energy generation above the jobs and investment that would be created across our economy if we were genuinely able to move towards a low-carbon economy we will particularly seek to push the government on a suggestion by the chartered institute of taxation that they produce a road map as they have done previously on aspects of taxation policy in particular corporation tax policy setting out their plans for the future of environmental taxes to help the renewable energy industry and business more generally to take long-term investment decisions that could be an important way for the government to set out their intentions for the life of this parliament and for us to test whether they mean it with regard to charting a course towards a low-carbon economy for our country insurance premium tax as i said in response to the hon member for gloucester (richard graham) is a significant revenue-raising measure clause 43 increasesthe standard rate of the tax from 6% to 9 5% with effect from 1 november 2015 raising \u00a31 6 billion there are very important questions about the distributional impact that that will have and whether those on middle and low incomes will bear the brunt of the increases it is interesting that the chancellor did not focus on the very significant revenue-raising measures in his budget indeed the rhetoric and narrative that he has been pursuing suggests that it is a budget of giveaways he will not be surprised that we will not let him get away with that characterisation insurance premium tax has been described as a stealth tax ministers will be aware that several industry figures have warned that increasing it could prompt policyholders to buy less cover possibly exacerbating problems caused by under-insurance particularly with regard to car insurance again we will wish to test those areas further in committee when we will look carefully at any analysis by government of the possible impact on under-insurance the aa has said that insurance premium tax on the average car insurance policy is equivalent to a fuel duty increase of almost 2p per litre so either way drivers are being hit in their pockets i would be grateful if the minister commented on the measure\u2019s overall distributional income what conversations the government have already had with the insurance industry and what this means for future changes to fuel duty as i have said we support other measures in the bill particularly the so-called tax lock both for income tax at the basic higher and additional rates and for vat i remind treasury ministers that back in 2009 the current chancellor was very critical about chancellors passing laws to ensure that they fulfil the promises they make in general election campaigns and i think that that criticism applies just as much to him now however we support the principle of the lock we have pledged not to raise vat national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax so we welcome those measures ", "my hon friend makes an important point i wonder whether we would have the tax lock had it not been for the vat bombshell poster we unveiled or for the exchanges at prime minister\u2019s questions ahead of the general election ministers were certainly very quick to write such a law and despite the chancellor having suggested in 2009 that passing laws to ensure promises on taxation are kept was a very bad idea he was very quick to convert to that cause nevertheless they are passing a law on the tax lock it was labour party policy and we are very pleased that we pushed the conservative party into our territory in agreeing that the rates for ordinary people on lower and middle incomes should not go up another change we support is on the annual investment allowance i am pleased that the direction of travel has been set out for the whole parliament that contrasts very strongly with what happened during the lastparliament when lots of chopping and changing on capital allowances definitely undermined business investment even if the deal is less generous with a decrease from \u00a3500 000 to \u00a3200 000 it is important that businesses at least know that the deal they are going to get will last a lot longer than it previously did as my hon friend the member for denton and reddish (andrew gwynne) has mentioned with respect to the expected changes on corporation tax there is a lack of concrete proposals for business rates the financial secretary has raised expectations and hopes of real change on business rates when the consultation is finally unveiled later this year we will certainly look at whether the business rates burden will come down for small and medium-sized companies ", "as the financial secretary knows because we have already had such an exchange i feel we are reliving our greatest hits on a number of occasions in the past couple of years our policy at the general election was our manifesto commitment not to go ahead with the corporation tax cut from 21% to 20% we would not have gone ahead with that additional cut to 20% but instead used all the money to pay for a cut to business rates this year and a freeze next year it was a direct switch spend we wanted to make a commitment to small and medium-sized businesses in our country to do something practical on business rates but we needed to find a way to pay for that and we chose to switch-spend in respect of the additional corporation tax cut we of course lost the election and the government are proposing a further decrease of the corporation tax rate we will support the corporation tax measures but we will ask questions about what that means for the future direction of travel following an intervention the financial secretary mentioned the beps project on corporation tax more generally it is important given how some companies seek to shift profits and game international taxation rules to have international agreement concern has already been expressed in some quarters that some of the countries with which we need to do business and with which we need to agree international tax rules might start to see us as a tax haven i disagree with such a characterisation but there is such a risk in getting agreement within the oecd beps process i would welcome it if treasury ministers could in committee provide further details about what is happening and about how our friends in the beps process are reacting and responding to the government\u2019s proposal on the headline rate of corporation tax one measure we have already voted against relates to inheritance tax clause 9 introduces an additional residence nil-rate band for inheritance tax when a home is passed to the direct descendants of the deceased on or after 6 april 2017 the provision which runs to more than 400 lines is extremely technical but it in effect allows parents to pass on a house worth \u00a31 million to their children free of inheritance tax we have made it clear that the focus of tax cuts should be to help people onmiddle and lower incomes and to tackle tax avoidance the treasury has admitted that 90% of households will not benefit from the government\u2019s inheritance tax policy their priority should be to help the majority of families and first-time buyers struggling to get a home of their own rather than a further cut to the rate of inheritance tax at this stage ", "the hon gentleman rather forgets that the scottish national party is not a national party in fact it is committed to breaking up our union if he and his colleagues aspire to be an official opposition they may wish to stop being a party of only national interest and stop trying to break up our country we did not merely abstain on the welfare bill as he well knows we voted for our reasoned amendment which is exactly what his party plans to do today if that approach was not good enough for us yesterday why do he and his colleagues think that it is good enough for them today if the hon gentleman has been listening to my now very lengthy remarks he will know that i have gone through the finance bill and the budget in detail and made it very clear that the bill does not contain many of the most contentious of the chancellor\u2019s budget decisions we will debate and oppose such measures when they are brought before the house as statutory instruments but those measures are not in this bill i have laid out in depth our approach to all the different measures in the bill including those that we support and those on which we will ask further questions and to which we will table amendments which we will vote on as the bill continues through its stages in this house the government have published further changes to the direct recovery of debts from bank accounts and in relation to carried interest that has excited some interest in the inboxes of members\u2019 email accounts with the campaign by 38 degrees we had a manifesto commitment in respect of carried interest i am not sure that the government\u2019s proposals in the finance bill go as far as we were hoping to go had we been elected as i say we will test the detail in committee in short sorry i mean  in conclusion as i have been on my feet for a while many of the most contentious elements of the budget are not in the finance bill it contains a mixture of measures that we support and measures that we will return to in great detail when we get to committee of the whole house i look forward to debating with ministers as the bill progresses through the house i hope that in winding up the minister will deal with some of the questions that i have raised in respect of bank taxation the climate change levy and insurance premium tax ", "research from the house of commons library shows that the effect of the chancellor\u2019s decision to increase the tax credit taper from 41% to 48% is that workers earning above the income tax personal allowance threshold will face a marginal effective tax rate of 73% in 2015-16 which increases to a staggering 80% in 2016-17 how does the minister reconcile the chancellor\u2019s rhetoric about standing up for workers with the reality of a marginal effective tax rate of 80% which is a hefty work penalty by any measure ", "high tax rates are normally loathed by conservative members but obviously not when they affect ordinary working people the chancellor has been busy trying to suggest that his national living wage will compensate for this work penalty but he knows that the real living wage is calculated on the basis of a full take-up of tax credits the very thing he has now cut is it not the case that regardless of the rhetoric all that this budget has delivered for ordinary working people in our country is a hefty work penalty and a living wage con ", "we have had a good debate today and over the last few sitting days it is a pleasure to close our budget deliberations on behalf of the opposition i would like to start by congratulating the hon members for kensington (victoria borwick) for paisley and renfrewshire south (mhairi black) for brecon and radnorshire (chris davies) for airdrie and shotts (neil gray) and for linlithgow and east falkirk (martyn day) on making their maiden speeches today i am sure all members will join me in wishing them well as they begin their journey of standing up for their constituents in this place last week the chancellor delivered his first budget of this parliament although his rhetoric might have delivered him positive headlines on thursday morning the reality is that his budget will deliver misery and hardship for ordinary working people because it leaves them worse off penalised for doing the right thing in working and punished for circumstances outside their control not only does this budget penalise people in low-paid work it fails the test of building a more productive economy because the chancellor has either flunked or ducked the big long-term decisions that need to be made on infrastructure what ordinary working people in our country needed was a budget that would make their lives easier make work pay and help people not just on to the first rung of the work ladder but on to the next one into better jobs with better prospects and better pay instead the chancellor focused his energies on his own bid for a better job better prospects and better pay rather than help the working poor to move up he focused on his own move next door the truth that government members have to confront is that 3 million working families will bear the brunt of the chancellor\u2019s \u00a34 5 billion-worth of cuts to tax credits these cuts will hit working people on middle and lower incomes completely undermining the tory argument that this is a budget for working people they penalised the very people in work who are trying to do the right thing and who do not earn enough to make ends meets as i said only a week ago it is wrong and unfair to remove tax credits from working people without first creating the conditions that would allow it to be done in a way that does not pull the rug from under people on low incomes by hitting them with what is effectively a hefty work penalty we all want to see a higher-wage economy in which people are less reliant on tax credits to make ends meet but we need to embed higher wages in the economy before we consider going ahead with any changes to tax credits ", "that was hardly worth the wait i have to say that the hon gentleman should have been paying attention to what my right hon and learned friend the member for camberwell and peckham(ms harman) actually said she came out very strongly against the whole package of working tax credit changes if he had listened to my remarks rather than try to intervene with a whip\u2019s question he would have realised that that is exactly what i am doing myself the government will say that they have moved on pay again however there is a big difference between rhetoric and reality the government\u2019s cuts to tax credits overwhelmingly outweigh their measures on pay i welcome the proposed rises in the national minimum wage which is still what it is [interruption ] i am pleased to see that the chancellor has joined us he has failed to explain why raising the minimum wage was so wrong only a few short weeks ago during the general election campaign in view of our manifesto commitment or how he came to agree with us so soon after the general election nevertheless imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery we are pleased to observe that the party that forced the last all-night sitting in the house in an attempt to block the introduction of the national minimum wage by the last labour government now agrees with us not only that it is important and necessary but that it should go up however we should be clear about the fact that it is not a living wage there has always been a difference between the minimum wage and the living wage re-badging the new national minimum wage as a living wage will not help the chancellor because ordinary working people can see a political con for what it is the living wage foundation was quick off the mark on budget day in making that very point the inconvenient fact for the chancellor is that the living wage the real living wage is calculated on the assumption of a full take-up of tax credits the very tax credits that the chancellor has just cut to make up for the loss of those tax credits a real living wage would have to be considerably higher than what the chancellor is now promising working people in britain the new national minimum wage rate of \u00a37 20 when it is introduced next year will be lower than the current living wage of \u00a37 85 in effect the chancellor who says that he stands with working people will offer working people in 2016 the 2011 living wage and we will not let him pretend otherwise in the end the simple truth is that the wage increases that are on their way are not enough to make up for the loss of tax credits twenty-four hours after the chancellor delivered his budget the institute for fiscal studies dismissed his claim that increasing the minimum wage would compensate working people the ifs said the key fact is that the increase in the minimum wage simply cannot provide full compensation for the majority of losses that will be experienced by tax credit recipients that is just arithmetically impossible the ifs also said that the biggest change which sounded very technical was the reduction in the work allowance it explained the work allowance is the amount that a claimant can earn before benefit starts to be withdrawn significant allowances were an integral part of the design of uc universal credit intended to give claimants an incentive to move into work this reform will cost about 3 million families an average of \u00a31 000 a year each it will reduce the incentive for the first earner in a family to enter work a regressive budget with a work penalty of \u00a31 000 a year that is what the government have delivered to ordinary working people in our country and whilethey hit those ordinary working people they also fail to address a central economic challenge productivity that is the puzzle that it is crucial for us to crack and solve because getting it right is vital if we are to achieve higher living standards sustained gdp growth and effective deficit reduction but this budget failed the productivity test ", "i will not give way for another whip\u2019s question i must make some progress productivity has stagnated under this government and the office for budget responsibility has revised its productivity forecast downwards for next year and the three years after that it has also confirmed that the chancellor will miss his target of increasing exports to \u00a31 trillion by a staggering \u00a3367 billion by 2020 productivity has been revised down and the current account deficit has widened to 5 9% of gdp becoming the largest annual peacetime deficit since at least 1830 however all that the government had to offer was a damp squib of a productivity plan on the friday after the budget a patchwork of existing schemes rather than a substantial reform to boost skills business growth and wages and in relation to infrastructure output that is lower than it was five years ago there are of course some measures in the budget that we will support not least those that started life [interruption ] i am glad that conservative members are cheering because the measures that i am about to mention started life on our benches as our manifesto commitments i welcome the government\u2019s new-found zeal in dealing with non-doms and with the so-called carried interest loophole involving private equity managers conservative members were not so vocal on such matters just a few weeks ago but i am glad that they have had a rethink since the general election and have found their voices when it comes to our policies we will however stand against measures that that are wrong and unfair apart from the overall package of measures on tax credits we are deeply concerned about the impact of removing student maintenance grants from the poorest undergraduates about the lowering of the level of benefit for those who cannot currently work and are in the work-related activity group and about the government\u2019s strategy on child poverty which essentially boils down to their changing the definitions because they will miss their target otherwise every budget is about choices this should have been a budget to bring the deficit down and help people into work and into better work by creating the high-skill high-pay jobs needed to boost productivity instead it penalises those already in work it is people on low and middle incomes the ordinary working people of britain who will pay the price for this chancellor\u2019s choices and we will stand with the ordinary working people of britain by voting against this budget tonight ", "i beg to move that this house believes that people should be given support and incentives to find employment and stay in employment notes that at a time when the recovery is still fragile for many the impact of a significant reduction in in-work tax credits could increase hardship and undermine the importance of making work pay believes that any meaningful effort to address the real causes of high welfare costs should tackle the underlying drivers of low pay housing costs and insecure working conditions further notes that the threat of a \u00a35 billion reduction in child tax credits would see 3 7 million working families lose an average of \u00a31 400 a year in income and urges the chancellor to guarantee that any assistance in the july 2015 budget is focused solely on people on middle and low incomes i am pleased that we have finally come on to our opposition day debate it was postponed last week and has been delayed today owing to the emergency debate on english votes for english laws it is important that we have this debate ahead of the budget because what the government decide to do tomorrow in relation to tax credits will show up the rhetoric they have been using since the election and prove whose side they are really on it is not the side of working people they say that they are now the workers\u2019 party indeed the chancellor\u2019s op-ed in the sun this weekend started with the line we were elected in may as a party for working people that\u2019s how we\u2019ll govern and that\u2019s who my budget this week is for on reading that line for the first time on sunday morning i would have choked on my cereal were it not for the fact that it is ramadan and i am fasting saying it asserting it simply does not make it true it is about what we do and the choices we make if the decision the government make tomorrow on tax credits is as we expect it will prove that their rhetoric is very far removed from the reality we know from what the chancellor said over the weekend that \u00a312 billion of savings from the welfare budget have been found it is reported that a substantial chunk of that money will come from cuts to tax credits certainly the government\u2019s attempts to discredit the tax credits regime suggest that they are laying the groundwork ahead of tomorrow\u2019s budget the independent institute for fiscal studies has suggested that the government could cut the childcare element of child tax credit back to its 2003-04 level saving \u00a35 1 billion per year the ifs says that a \u00a35 billion cut in tax credits in this way would mean some 3 7 million families losing \u00a31 400 a year on average and would push a further 300 000 children into relative poverty those are huge sums of money for working people on low pay people who are trying to do the right thing who are at the mercy of a labour market that at the lower end is insecure and of high housing costs that keep going up and up without tax credits to help them through those who are working and stuck on low pay simply cannot make ends meet ", "my hon friend makes a really important point in her customary powerful way she is absolutely right behind each of these statistics 3 7 million families and 300 000 children are shockingly large numbers are individual stories of hardship and toil people trying to do the right thing and being punished by the choices the government will make tomorrow ", "and many of those people going into work i gently say to the hon and learned lady will be in receipt of tax credits the only way that that work will pay for those individuals moving from unemployment into work is through the tax credits her government may well cut tomorrow ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the national minimum wage would have to rise by 25% overnight tonight if the government make these changes tomorrow i shall come later to the difficulties and to the changes we need to make to the national minimum wage ", "my right hon friend is absolutely right and this is where i disagree with the tenor of the comments from government members in the debates on the economy thus far in this parliament for them a job is a job is a job whereas we have a better boldervision for people moving into work not just for their first job which could be any job but for progressing we do not do that by punishing people and taking away the support they rely on when stuck in low-paid work we have to chart a course towards a higher skilled higher wage economy but that is not going to happen before tomorrow\u2019s budget the support for those on tax credits should not be removed before we have that high-wage economy ", "i gently say to the hon gentleman that 60% of those in receipt of tax credits do not pay income tax anyway if someone is working 30 hours a week on the national minimum wage they are below the \u00a310 600 personal allowance threshold ", "my hon friend makes her point powerfully but it is not that government members do not understand i think they know full well the impact of their decisions they simply want to pretend it is not going to be as bad as everybody knows it will be a resolution foundation study of these proposals just a couple of weeks ago suggests that over two-thirds of the families affected would be in-work that almost two-thirds of the cut would be borne by the poorest 30 per cent of households and that almost none of the cut would fall upon the richest 40 per cent of households on what basis then can the tories claim to be the party of working people these are the working people the government are choosing to hit and hurt if they are happy to make these choices they should at least admit that rather than hiding behind the rhetoric of being the party of working people as if somehow that will get them through the next five years ", "the hon lady makes a powerful point and i absolutely agree with her of course it was the support available via tax credits that meant that in the recession some people could remain in work evenwhen their employers had to cut back on their hours as a result of the global financial crisis that is an important point the government\u2019s critique of tax credits over the last couple of weeks has implied that this is a flawed regime that does not work and simply subsidises so-called poverty pay but a simple examination of the facts shows that the case undermining tax credits is weak if the government were serious about tackling the reasons why people have to rely on tax credits they would come forward tomorrow not with planned cuts or immediate cuts to tax credits but with longer-term measures to tackle the underlying factors of low pay high housing costs and insecure employment there are 4 6 million households in the uk claiming tax credits four million of the families claiming them have children and 2 7 million of those families are in work there are 5 million children in working families receiving tax credits and over 70% of all of those with or without children claiming tax credits are in work they were introduced in 2003 to tackle poverty and make work pay much of the debate at the time was focused on helping single parents to get into work we know that the lone parent employment rate rose by 28% between 1997 and 2010 and by a staggering 43% between 1997 and 2014 ", "i want to make some progress but i will give way a little later a study of tax credits by the resolution foundation in 2012 found that the introduction of working families tax credit which was the predecessor to working tax credit provided a small but direct boost to employment particularly for single parents the economics editor of the financial times recently said britain\u2019s financial support for low income working families is a key reason why we now have a high employment rate and\u2026the prime minister must take care not to put at risk a 20 year success story ", "no i do not agree and there is a difference between eliminating support from working people in the budget tomorrow and charting a course that would look more like long-term reform of working tax credits to deal with some of the issues relating to clustering at 16 hours which members have spoken about previously however that should not be done before tackling the underlying factors that are driving people into low-paid employment and keeping them stuck in that employment ", "in the end it is about building more houses that is something that this government have singularly failed to do over the five years during which they have already been in government in view of what is being briefed ahead of the budget tomorrow it does not seem to me that they are going to come forward with a game-changing plan when it comes to house building in our country tax credits and child poverty are inextricably linked the same resolution foundation study of 2012 found that there was a clear inverse link between spending on tax credits and child poverty rates the latest households below average income figures show that progress in tackling child poverty has ground to a halt since this government came to office with 2 3 million children remaining in relative poverty and 2 6 million in absolute poverty the work and pensions secretary spent most of last week trying to distract from the government\u2019s record on child poverty first by trying to claim a win on child poverty on the basis that the figures were not as bad as some suggested they might have been in itself indicative of a shocking complacency and then by changing the definition of child poverty the reality remains that too many children in our country struggle with a poor and difficult start in life that directly impacts on their life chances as adults if not dealt with early this means that we will all face higher costs further down the track as i mentioned the ifs says that cutting \u00a35 billion-worth of tax credits tomorrow will push a further 300 000 children into relative poverty tax credit cuts will do nothing to address child poverty they will simply add to it government members would have us believe that by cutting tax credits wages will automatically rise to compensate workers but that is simply not going to happen employers will not give everyone a pay rise on the day the chancellor cuts tax credits as i said the national minimum wage would have to rise by 25% overnight to compensate a lone parent working 16 hours a week for the loss of tax credit and the wage of a worker on average earnings of \u00a322 000 a year would have to rise by 6% overnight that would require employers to raise pay overnight by twice the amount by which the office for budget responsibility has said that they will raise pay over a full year and we know that there is not a chance in hell that that will happen ", "my hon friend has made a powerful point and i agree with all that she has said ", "i think that what we are talking about is the cost of making work pay in the economy that we have at the moment as i will explain in more detail later the government are doing things the wrong way round as was pointed out by the chair of the work and pensions select committee my right hon friend the member for birkenhead (frank field) we must establish a higher-skill higher-wage economy before we remove the support for those who are stuck on low pay i would prefer people not to be in that position ", "i think that it is for the government to tell us what they plan to do about the living wage and i hope that the minister will enlighten us when he winds up the debate at the time of the general election we made a manifesto commitment to incentivise employers to pay the living wage the government are welcome to steal that policy but they should steal it and allow it to embed a living wage and higher wages in our economy before they start messing around with tax credits ", "i will give way to the hon member for bedford (richard fuller) but then i must make some progress ", "the hon gentleman has made some interesting and important observations about the way in which we can encourage employers to pay the living wage and i hope that ministers take up his suggestions ours was a clear straightforward policy to incentivise the paying of the living wage by sharing with employers the benefit that the government obtain because people are earning more money ", "i am afraid that the boy-band operation on the government back benches is a little unimpressive rather than give way for a further whip\u2019s question i shall make a little more progress another argument advanced by government members in recent weeks is that tax credits have been subsidising poverty pay there is academic and expert evidence that they have not depressed wages at the lower end and that there has been no general slippage in the part of the earnings distribution where they bite for the sake of argument however let us agree that in an ideal world we would not even take the risk that tax credits might depress wages or subsidise low or poverty pay indeed let us agree that we would ideally want a system in which they were not needed at all because everyone could earn a high enough wage to manage perfectly well without them if the government were serious about that they would come forward first with proper and realistic proposals for increasing wages and tackling low pay and then start thinking about reform of tax credits instead they are putting the cart before the horse and doing things the wrong way round salami-slicing the tax credits budget but without any credible plan to get wages up before the cuts bite the government have no plans to ensure working families do not lose out from their tax credit cuts instead of tackling low pay the conservatives are attacking the low paid and they have form they cut tax credits 14 times in the last parliament including cutting the childcare element of working tax credits from 80% to 70% of a child\u2019s childcare costs costing some working families up to \u00a31 560 a year an average loss of \u00a3570 per year and increasing the working hours threshold for couples to qualify for wtc from 16 to 24 hours per week with an average loss of \u00a32 600 for families unable to increase their working hours according to research commissioned by us from the house of commons library we also know that there are a number of indicators to suggest that the recovery is not feeding through to job security and pay growth for those who have to rely on tax credits ", "my hon friend raises an important point and we will have to see whether we get any additional information on the impact on equalities ahead of the budget but we already know from what we saw over the last parliament that women are disproportionately affected when the government start to cut tax credits as are black and minority ethnic communities ", "i am going to make a little more progress as i have said we also know that a number of indicators suggest that the recovery is not feeding through to job security and pay growth for those who have to rely on tax credits the number of jobs in low-paid sectors grew at twice the rate of those in non-low-paid sectors between the second quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2014 the number of working people paid housing benefit has risen by 400 000 since 2010 because working people are not bringing home enough money to pay the rent the number of people earning less than the living wage has increased by 1 8 million since 2009 now it seems that these same people the strivers the doers and the workers whom the chancellor claims to want to put his arms around and hug close are having been hit hard over the last five years going to bear the brunt again labour believes the way into work and off welfare is by tackling the real causes of high welfare costs the underlying drivers of low pay high housing benefit costs and insecure working conditions the government\u2019s failure to address these underlying causes in a meaningful way over the past five years has meant they have spent \u00a325 billion more than they expected to spend on welfare in 2010 the welfare bill remains higher than expected for the same reason as the deficit remains high we cannot disconnect what happens in household budgets from the economy overall and that means we cannot remove tax credits for working people without creating the conditions which allow that to be done in a way that does not penalise workers on low pay we want a higher-wage economy where people are less reliant on tax credits to make ends meet that is why we set out plans to raise the minimum wage to at least \u00a38 an hour by 2019 and it is why we support the living wage and set out proposals in our manifesto to encourage and incentivise business to pay it i strongly encourage the government to steal our policy and if they do steal it they should do so as a first step to embedding higher wages in the economy before they consider going ahead with any changes to tax credits the government also should remember that the way in which the living wage is set assumes that families are already taking up their full tax credits entitlement the greater london authority which works out the london living wage says if means-tested benefits were not taken into account (that is tax credits housing benefits and council tax benefit) the living wage would be approximately \u00a311 65 per hour that is more than \u00a32 higher than it is at the moment the living wage already has tax credits priced in and it will not be a living wage in the face of tax credit cuts if the government come forward tomorrow with proposals on the living wage they will have to explain either that they are going to go for a much higher living wage than we have at the moment or why they are going to hit working people again and again the proposed tax credit cuts tomorrow have attracted widespread criticism across the political spectrum everyone agrees that people should be better off in work than unemployed but removing or significantly cutting tax credits without having charted a course towards a high-skill high-wage economy means that this government are not tackling low pay but are attacking the low paid that is wrong those people will be punished for circumstances outside their control as they try to do the right thing hon members from across the house should send a clear signal to the government that that is wrong approach and vote in favour of our motion ", "to ask the secretary of state for

mention the speeches of my hon friends the members for hartlepool (mr wright) for newcastle upon tyne central (chi onwurah) for croydon north (mr reed) for sefton central (bill esterson) and for bristol west (thangam debbonaire) may i also congratulate the hon members who made their maiden speeches today i am talking about the hon member for hertsmere (oliver dowden) or indeed for albert

both to this house and i wish them well as they use the power of their voices to speak on behalf of their constituents and pursue the causes that matter to them one such cause and central issue of the day on which i hope there is consensus in the house is productivity and the impact of productivity on the performance of our economy productivity is the central economic challenge facing the government and i believe that getting it right is vital if we are to achieve higher living standards sustained gdp growth and effective deficit reduction we must seek to maximise output from the efforts of working people if workers can produce more their employers can pay more tax revenues can be morebuoyant and gdp growth stronger and more sustainable in short if we get this right then everyone is a winner governments can make choices to pull the levers at their disposal when it comes to the national minimum wage or indeed the living wage but when it comes to wider wage growth across the rest of the economy and for those on middle incomes then higher productivity is the way forward as the cbi and indeed the bank of england have also emphasised we should all agree in this house that gdp growth that is driven just by increasing the number of people in work and how many hours they work will not make people better off as a nation rather than settling for the current state of things we should aspire to have more for us all to be better and to be stronger we should have a broader vision and ambition for everyone in our country especially those who are currently stuck in low-paid work what has been happening to productivity on this government\u2019s watch seven years on from the global financial crisis some tories appear to have forgotten that there was a global financial crisis before labour left power productivity is still 1 7% below the pre-crisis peak between 2010 and 2014 productivity has grown by an average of just 0 4% a year in quarter 4 of 2014 productivity growth fell by 0 2% compared with the previous quarter and productivity growth was also negative in 2013 and 2012 at minus 0 3% and minus 1 2% respectively uk output per hour is now 17 percentage points below the g7 average and 31 percentage points below that of the united states of america the office for budget responsibility says that productivity growth is the most important and uncertain part of its economic forecast the office for national statistics says that the stagnation of productivity is  unprecedented the bank of england says that this is one of its main concerns about the nature of the recovery going forward one response to this productivity puzzle would be to think that this is just how things are that this is a necessary and inevitable consequence of a changing world but it does not have to be this way and we should not settle for things being this way despite the post-election pronouncements about a soon-to-be-announced so-called productivity plan with respect the tories\u2019 inaction and ineffectiveness on this issue over their previous five years in government suggests that they have been content to settle for things exactly as they are how else can the chancellor explain his complete failure even to mention productivity during his march budget speech or his failure to prioritise productivity growth over the previous five years but he and his team can listen today and start to put things right as they look ahead to the july budget the chancellor has choices to make ahead of the first fiscal event of this parliament and he should make choices that will boost productivity the chancellor could focus on skills and innovation we have heard today that jobs growth has been disproportionately focused on lower-skilled work since mid-2013 and we have a persistent trend of insecurity in the labour market and inevitably weak wage growth too the government are wrong to sit back and watchthat happen because our labour market is changing and the jobs of tomorrow will look very different from the jobs of 20 years ago our future workforce is also changing it is ageing there are more women and there are increasing numbers of people with high-level qualifications the opposition believe that with so much talent to harness public spending should focus on enhancing investment skills and innovation the tories have failed thus far to provide any real solutions or strategies to build the productive high-skilled high-wage workforce that this country needs and this must urgently change on infrastructure frankly labour has already done the heavy lifting with the report that we commissioned from sir john armitt whose proposal accepted in full by us for a national infrastructure commission is one that the current government should also adopt indeed we have even prepared the draft legislation with all the work done and given that it is in the national interest ministers can have that one for free and they should go ahead and do it the chancellor should also listen to us and allow the obr to publish an assessment of how the likely options for the spending review due later this year would impact on productivity i know that we have asked him several times to allow the obr to do a number of things such as auditing party general election manifestos or preparing reports to inform the eu referendum debate unfortunately the chancellor has never taken the opportunity to listen to us before however it is important that we have a wider understanding of the big and difficult choices that will be made on public spending and frankly he should not run away or hide from having some light shed on the consequences of the different choices open to him or indeed the scrutiny that will come once he has made his choices with no clear plan to boost productivity over the past five years no significant drive for the skills that are needed for good high-wage jobs no national infrastructure commission and no long-term funding framework for science and only now plans for a plan in july the chancellor is coming late to this particular party but if he is going to show up and today\u2019s no-show does not inspire confidence he needs to make it count his party colleagues could help him on his way by voting for our motion ", "to ask the secretary of state for justice with reference to the hm treasury

point takes us back to our earlier debate about the value of the headline rate of corporation tax and the policy environment that supports it clearly more needs to be done on the business rates regime we back the announcement of a review of business rates there are problems in the system for example a factory investing in a new piece of equipment will find that its bill will go up next year because property is now worth more which could be a disincentive to invest although our corporate property tax system needs to be fundamentally rethought small businesses need urgent and immediate relief our proposal for a cut in business rates in the first year of the next parliament followed by a freeze in the second year will make a genuine difference i hope that government members will today take the opportunity that they have failed to take previously support our amendment and thereby show their support for small and medium-sized businesses ", "i beg to move amendment 2 page\u00a03 \u00a0line\u00a039 \u00a0at end insert (3) the chancellor of the exchequer shall undertake a review within six months of the passing of this act of the impact of a cut of one per cent to the main rate of corporation tax for financial year 2016 with particular reference to (a) the impact on businesses with fewer than 50 employees (b) the impact on investment by businesses with fewer than 50 employees and(c) alternative tax measures including non-domestic rates which would have a greater benefit for businesses with fewer than 50 employees (4) the chancellor of the exchequer must publish the report of the review and lay the report before the house ", "the review proposed in amendment 2 would give us a better understanding of the factors that are helping small businesses to grow and those that are limiting their expansion most small and medium-sized businesses with a smaller number of employees tend to be run from premises that have a rateable value of below \u00a350 000 i should say at the outset the minister and i have had this debate before that labour does not oppose the recent changes to the rate of corporation tax that have so far come into effect that is in keeping with our party\u2019s policy over the past 15 years when labour left office britain had the most competitive rate of corporation tax in the g7 the rate has been cut several times over the past few years the small business rate for companies whose profits are less than \u00a3300 000 now stands at 20% and the rate for companies earning more than that will be 21% from april in just a few days ", "my hon friend is right this comes back to the impact of the choices being made who is being prioritised and who is not who is bearing the greater share of the burden and who is not that is the material point we know that the government\u2019s impact assessment prepared for the 2014 budget estimates that the cost to the exchequer of the corporation tax cut would be some \u00a3400 million in 2015-16 \u00a3785 million in 2016-17 and \u00a3865 million the following year in the 2015 budget red book the estimates are revised upwards for 2015-16 \u00a3550 million for 2016-17 \u00a31 045 billion and for 2017-18 \u00a31 1 billion those are not insignificant sums for a policy that affects a relatively small number of businesses that is exactly my hon friend\u2019s point the government estimate that some 40 000 businesses pay the main rate of corporation tax and a further 41 000 businesses pay at the marginal relief rate the department for business innovation and skills estimates that the uk has some 5 2 million private sector businesses the majority of which 3 9 million are sole proprietorships and 1 million have fewer than 10 employees clearly if about 81 000 businesses benefit from the corporation tax cut the opposite is also true 5 1 million businesses do not benefit in any way from that rate change the government believe that a further cut in the corporation tax rate makes uk plc a more attractive place to invest and a more attractive destination for business to locate the minister and i have often debated the importance of the headline rate of corporation tax when that judgment call is made by businesses it is important a point that i have made on several occasions but it is worth noting that on the former point it is far from clear that this is the case we know that business investment fell from 8 2% of gdp in 2010 to 7 8% in 2013 that should not come as a big surprise businesses tell us that they face a range of issues and that their decisions about where to locate and where to remain and invest are not based only on the headline rate of corporation tax they take many other factors into account such as infrastructure and the skills available in the labour market businesses often say that these factors are very important to their decision making but they worry that under this government those are areas of policy have not gone in the right direction ", "this might be the one time during a finance bill debate when the hon gentleman and i have been in complete agreement the uncertainty caused by the conservative party\u2019s positioning over europeand the prime minister giving in to the needs of his party rather than the national interest have caused a huge amount of uncertainty in every conversation that i have had with businesses ever since the prime minister made his announcement that has been the no 1 issue that they have raised when talking about their future in our country their future ability to invest in our country and their future ability to employ more people in our country it has caused a huge amount of consternation and uncertainty and the conservative part of the coalition has been wrong to put its party interest ahead of the national interest our amendment seeks to put flesh on the bones of what is happening to corporation tax by assessing the impact on and the benefit to smaller companies with 50 or fewer employees which make up the vast majority of private companies in our country at a time when there are still difficult financial choices to make and a relatively limited number of ways to raise revenue and help support businesses to grow the evidence suggests that now is the time to give much more support to smaller businesses and to prioritise smaller businesses for some change in their circumstances ahead of larger businesses which have with the support of all parts of the house fared pretty well when it comes to cuts to the headline rate of corporation tax there is general agreement that small and medium-sized enterprises are the engine of growth in our country employing more than half of the private sector work force and contributing to 50% of uk gdp but times remain tough and they face wide-ranging challenges they struggle with high energy costs that do not seem to be getting much better despite wholesale price cuts of 20% in the past year and with late payments and charges according to the government\u2019s own figures 44% of smes had a problem with late payments last year with the average small business owed over \u00a330 000 an astonishingly high figure ", "my hon friend makes an important and interesting point this is not only about how we how we make choices that prioritise help for those who particularly need it my case is that smes need particular help with business rates but the impact of the choices we are making and whether they are leading to the change that we hope to see my case i know she will agree is that additional support for smes will yield greater gains for uk plc this is not about pitting one type of business against another government members have tried to argue that the rise in corporation tax from 20% to 21% that we advocate is an anti-business move but every single penny of the money from that change will be spent on smes and i defy them to try to imply that they are not true businesses ", "if my hon friend wants to intervene i will give way again ", "my hon friend is right i am glad that she has put on record the interplay between the consumer rights bill and small businesses that was a missed opportunity the government should have taken the opportunities available to them during the passage of that bill to offer a further boost to these struggling businesses all 5 1 million of them the vast majority of businesses in our country could have been supported small businesses struggle not only with high energy costs late payments and charges but with access to finance every time we discuss these issues the problem of access to finance comes up i am afraid that the government have failed to get a grip on this since 2010 lending has fallen by a colossal \u00a356 billion even in the most recent quarter net lending to small business fell by a further \u00a31 billion research has shown that some 85% of small businesses are locked into the big five banks alone it has also shown that most smes will approach only the larger banks when looking for finance and that even then the rejection rate is about 50% then there is the pressing issue of business rates business rates are levied on the estimated market rental cost of most non-residential properties and currently based on 2008 rental values in 2012-13 they raised \u00a326 1 billion relief on business rates exists for low-value properties those with a rateable value of below \u00a36 000 which are subject to a 100% discount since april 2013 local authorities in england have been able to retain between a quarter and a half of the rates raised from new developments for many small businesses business rates are a significant overhead that they need to factor in more than one in 10 small businesses say that they spend more on business rates than on their rent the only choice for many of those shops workshops start-ups and others that pay business rates is to pass the costs of the rates on to their customers i come from a tradition of small business my first job i have to say that it was unpaid was helping my parents to serve customers in the corner shop that was also our home after school at the weekend and in the holidays i did the stocktake with my dad went to the cash and carry and sorted out the vat i have a clear idea of the stresses and strains that people who run small businesses go through on a day-to-day basis and what their families and young children go through as they help to try to keep things afloat my constituency covers birmingham city centre so hon members can imagine the number of retailers both big and small i hear from regularly many constituents often express the fear that the exponential growth of business rates might put them out of business it is a concern for the people i meet i sometimes hear those stories from people who set up businesses in the \u201960s and \u201970s they have successfully survived the economic ups and downs since that time only now to believe that they might finally be done in by the growth of the burden of business rates on small and medium-sized businesses we should remember that the 2008 revaluation rate reflected an entirely different time of property prices small businesses are stuck paying rates at 2008 levels which do not reflect the lower property values caused by the financial crisis research suggests that in my west midlands region the rateable value for retail units is 13% too high for offices it is 19% too high and for industrial units it is 16% too high the latest research shows that the average business rate increase since 2010 has been \u00a31 500 we have had a lot of debate this afternoon about the relative value of such sums of money to different people and businesses but i can say with complete confidence that that is a lot of money for a small business it is easy to see why the word  critical has been used in relation to the current business rates regime when people are struggling to make ends meet in their business when they are struggling to ensure that all their bills are paid and when their status as a going concern is in doubt \u00a31 500 is a significant sum of money it is a big overhead it has made a huge difference to the ability of small and medium-sized businesses in our country to continue to grow employ more people and succeed business rates are central to the success of small businesses that leads us to ask the chancellor to assess and review alternative tax measures such as a change to non-domestic rates which would have a greater benefit for businesses with fewer than 50 employees specifically we believe that a cut in businesses rates for 1 5 million small businesses and then a freeze the following year would be enormously helpful and would make a difference to the ability of businesses of that size to keep their heads above water and keep their businesses moving forward the measure would be worth an average of \u00a3450 over two years to 1 5 million businesses including shops pubs and small start-ups some firms would benefit by up to \u00a32 000 as i have said an initial cut and then a freeze in business rates in the first two years of the next parliament would be paid for it is another fully funded proposal for the labour party manifesto on which we will seek election from the british people in a few weeks\u2019 time it will be paid for by not going ahead with the government\u2019s cut in corporation tax it will happen in april it is just a few days away from 21% to 20% for the 80 000 largest firms in our country we would spend all the money raised from not going ahead with that additional 1% cut in corporation tax on those 1 5 million small firms instead as i said in response to an earlier intervention government members have mischaracterised our corporation tax proposals as anti-business the minister and i sometimes agree to a score draw when we debate but his mischaracterisation of our proposal is just plain wrong it is also unlike him to be uncharitable and unwilling to engage with the issue at hand i hope he will pick up on that when he responds during a media appearance on  daily politics i put it to the conservative party chairman that his party\u2019s contention that our corporation tax proposals are anti-business only holds true if the conservatives believe that 1 5 million small firms are not really businesses he evaded that point and no conservative member has ever stood up to justify their characterisation of our corporation tax proposals as anti-business by saying that they believe that 1 5 million small businesses arenot actually businesses the minister does not look like he is about to jump up and say  oh no you\u2019ve got us wrong that tells me pretty much all i need to know which is that the conservatives are happy to whip up anti-business fervour but it is misguided and incorrect if we are elected in a few weeks\u2019 time every single penny of the money we raise by not going ahead with a corporation tax cut from 21% to 20% will be spent on small and medium-sized businesses they need that help and they should be prioritised to receive it that is the choice we will make to help small and medium-sized businesses we already have the lowest rate of corporation tax in europe but we also have the most expensive property tax that is why it makes no sense for the government to make it a priority to cut a tax that is already among the most competitive but not help smaller firms with very large costs ", "not at all ", "if the minister was listening to my speech he would know that i am asking for a report to give us a better idea of what this measure will raise including all the data to hand from the additional years in which the rate was in place but not included in the 2011 hmrc report all i can say to him on the figures is that the only certain figure we have is the \u00a33 billion static cost i accept that behavioural change will bring that down and decrease the yield but neither he nor i can say with hands on our holy books that we know the exact number that explains what i have asked for in the amendment i believe this could be a revenue-raising measure to get the deficit down in a fairer way the extent to which we can do that is the thrust of my amendment ", "my hon friend is absolutely right in fact when i was talking about vat in my constituency yesterday i was struck by the number of people i met who were in work but using food banks they are trying to do the right thing and working as hard as they possibly can yet they still cannot put food on the table how must it feel for them to find themselves in that situation and to know that under the current government a millionaire is better off to the tune of a hundred grand a year i would say that it feels pretty rubbish and that is what my constituents are telling me every day ", "my hon friend has acquitted herself of that duty in her usual brilliant way we may not be able to persuade the conservatives to be fully thatcherite but getting them part of the way there would be welcome if they cannot bring themselves to support bringing back the 50p rate which of course they will not they should at least support our amendment as i said it comes down to a simple question is the burden of deficit reduction and dealing with the fall-out from the global financial crisis being shared fairly across all parts of our society the amendment is genuinely intended to shed some light on that ", "that is exactly the point if the government have nothing to hide and nothing to fear from all the data being out there for us to interrogate they should accept our amendment and get on with the review that we have called for they should have got on with it when we first called for it immediately after they made the change to the rate our amendment genuinely seeks to shine light on what has been happening to people\u2019s incomes and the impact of changes to the top rate of tax when the government commissioned their report the data were not extensive and the report has been contentious from the minute it came off the printer the reasons for that go to the thrust of what the financial secretary was asking me earlier and i will come on to those points shortly as we have heard the labour government introduced the 50p rate it came into effect in 2010-11 and was a decision made after the financial crisis as we sought to get the deficit down there was nothing in the coalition agreement about abolishing the 50p rate but in 2011 hmrc was asked to look into it and the yields it produced it did not take a genius to work out that the chancellor was thinking about cutting the top rate of tax and in 2012 with hmrc\u2019s report the exchequer effected a 50% additional rate of income tax to back up the chancellor cutting the rate to 45p ", "as ever my hon friend is absolutely right and it is precisely to get that additional data that we have tabled this and similar amendments ever since the change was made why would the government go through the process of looking at yield and getting hmrc to produce a report in 2011 that is important because everyone knew both at the time and ever since that there were not enough data to come to an accurate view about yield as the rate had not been in place long enough to put it bluntly the chancellor probably felt that some people might not agree with his decision to give people earning more than \u00a3150 000 a massive tax cut given the state of the rest of the economy and the crushing of people\u2019s living standards on his watch what he needed to back his decision was a report that said that the 50p rate hardly raised anything at all which is precisely what the hmrc report said after analysing a host of facts and figures the report concluded that a cut that would by the government\u2019s initial estimates cost \u00a33 billion the so-called static cost excluding all behavioural changes would cost only \u00a3100 million the trouble with the report is that as everyone acknowledges there are too many uncertain variables to be anywhere near sure that the figure of \u00a3100 million is even close to reality the report was based on only one year\u2019s worth of data relating to 2010-11 that is a significant weakness since we know that some incomes were taken earlier to avoid the extra tax further detail is now available including for the tax years of 2011-12 and 2012-13 when the 50p rate was still in place the writers of the 2011 report did not have those data available so their report is therefore lacking that could be remedied were the government to accept our amendment the report attempts to quantify behavioural change the scale of behavioural change is primarily based on an assessment of taxable income elasticity basically the extent to which taxable income changes when the tax rate changes the ifs says that there is a margin of error within calculations for the 2011 report and that staying within that margin of error one could easily say depending on taxable income elasticity that cutting the rate of tax could cost the exchequer \u00a3700 million or could raise \u00a3600 million that gives an idea of the range of figures we are talking about and of how uncertain such projections are i return to my central point more data are now available and could help to calculate a truer picture of the yield of a 50p tax rate as opposed to a rate of 45p if conservative members are so certain that their position on the abolition of the 50p rate is true why will they not agree to the scrutiny that the amendment suggests ", "i was here for that debate and my hon friend the shadow chief secretary was recognising that the first thing we start with is the static costing that is the only certain figure we have and that starts us off at \u00a33 billion we have of course to make an allowance for behavioural change and that will impact on the yield but the calculation for how we get to understanding the behavioural change is the bone of contention between the financial secretary and me ", "my interpretation of what the minister is saying is that he is making a valiant attempt at trying to create something out of nothing as i said i was here for that debate and i remember that exchange very well the financial secretary and my hon friend the shadow chief secretary had a bit of to-ing and fro-ing over the static costing but the rest of the debate and everything my hon friend said was absolutely clear it has always been our position that we start with the static costing and that is not in doubt it is \u00a33 billion the question then is what happens when we allow for the impact of behavioural change my contention it has always been our contention it is exactly what the shadow chief secretary said in his remarks in that debate on that day is that the extent of behavioural change as envisaged in the 2011 report was based on an uncertain set of figures and that we have much more data now to be able to get to a certain point ", "i am not going to give way again because i have very little time the minister can pick the point up again in debate and i am sure he will do so it is not sufficient for government members simply to point at the increased yield following the rate cut to 45p and deem that their point has been proved just as people brought forward their incomes before the rate was introduced so people held off taking income until the rate was lowered we know the increase in yield at 45p was due primarily to record bonuses which were up 80% in the year after the rate was reduced if the truth is what is sought then rigorous analysis is what is required the blunt truth however is that the truth is not what is being sought here by the government the decision was taken for ideological reasons there is no other justification the abolition of the 50p rate was nothing other than a huge tax cut for the very richest while ordinary families continued to struggle and struggle for longer there is growth in the economy and that is welcome but it has been a long time coming it is ordinary families who have ended up paying the price that is why we have continued to press home the point about the top rate of tax while ordinary families are paying the price we have let the very wealthiest in our countryhave a huge tax cut that cannot be right a top rate of tax at 50p will play an important role towards fair deficit reduction under the next labour government if the government have absolutely nothing to hide or fear in the facts and figures behind the cut from 50p to 45p they should accept our amendment to clause 1 ", "i beg to move amendment 1 page\u00a02 \u00a0line\u00a01 \u00a0at end insert (3) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within three months of the passing of this act publish a report on the impact of setting the additional rate of income tax at 50 per cent (4) the report must estimate the impact of setting the additional rate for 2015-16 at 45 per cent and at 50 per cent on the amount of income tax currently paid by someone with a taxable income of (a) \u00a3150 000 per year and(b) \u00a31 000 000 per year ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship sir roger amendment 1 stands in my name and those of my right hon friend the member for morley and outwood (ed balls) my hon friends the members for nottingham east (chris leslie) and for kilmarnock and loudoun (cathy jamieson) and the hon member for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) it calls on the chancellor to produce within three months of the enactment of this bill a report on the impact of setting the additional rate of income tax at 50% the report must estimate the impact of setting the additional rate for 2015-16 at 45% the current higher rate and at 50% on the amount of income tax currently paid by people with a taxable income of \u00a3150 000 and \u00a31 million a year as we all know the 50p rate of tax for those earning more than \u00a3150 000 was reduced to 45p by this government in 2012 that was hotly debated at the time and it has been hotly debated ever since the minister refers to a debate on the additional rate of tax as an annual event whenever we discuss a finance bill government members may groan that the debate is rearing its head again but i am if nothing else an optimistic person and i continue to hope that government members will be swayed by my arguments and be persuaded to accept our eminently sensible and reasonable amendment ", "it is a little unfair of the hon gentleman to shake his head at such an early stage of my speech he should at least give me a chance to develop my arguments ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the measure has a static cost of \u00a33 billion a year and behavioural changes also have an impact that is the hot debate in which the minister and i have been engaged ever since i have been in the shadow treasury team ", "the minister is tempting me to go further than i want to at this stage because i am going to develop exactly those arguments about the costing what the measure is likely to raise and the inherent uncertainty in the government\u2019s work and the report that they produced the minister will be welcome to intervene once i have reached that point in my speech ", "my hon friend is both generous and correct members who were here for the last debate will know that government members utterly failed to meet the charge levelled at them which was that the combination of their history on vat and what they wish to achieve in the next parliament means that a vat rise is inevitable if the conservative party is elected to government in a few weeks\u2019 time we know that the government\u2019s decision to reduce the top rate of tax for those earning more than \u00a3150 000 is as much at the heart of the current political debate today and in the next few weeks as it was in 2012 the debate is about where we raise revenue from and who we ask to shoulder the burden to help bring down the deficit further ", "i was not a member at that time so i was not a part of that government at all but i am proud of the previous government\u2019s record over 13 years the hon gentleman will know that we raised the top rate of tax to 50p in response to the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do [interruption ] he asked about the minimum wage and mentions it yet again from a sedentary position but we were the government who introduced the minimum wage in legislation that was one of our proudest achievements and my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston (ms stuart) told me last week that the last all-night sitting of the house of commons was when the labour government introduced the national minimum wage labour members were in the house at eight in the morning to vote it through and they were absolutely right to do so ", "my hon friend is absolutely right i was coming on to exactly that point this is a question about living standards what is happening to the poorest in our society and where the burden should ultimately rest for sorting out the nation\u2019s finances after the global financial crisis at the budget last week the chancellor would have had us believe that people are on average \u00a3900 better off as well as more secure as the result of his policies i have to hand it to him he has been highly innovative in using a new measure of living standards to try to back up his claim but it includes income to universities and charities i do not blame him for trying but he knows the truth as do members and the public which is that people say time and again that they are worse off a poll of 5 000 consumers\u2019 responses to the budget showed that three quarters of people have seen no improvement in their living standards a populus poll before christmas found that only one in seven adults said they were feeling the benefit of recent economic growth as my hon friend the member for denton and reddish (andrew gwynne) has said wages after inflation are down by \u00a31 600 and the combined impact of tax and benefit changes has left families on average \u00a31 127 a year worse off that was the context in which it was decided to reduce the additional rate of tax to 45p giving millionaires a tax cut worth an average of \u00a3100 000 which is a huge sum of money by any standards as i have just said wages are down by \u00a31 600 a year tax and benefit changes have left people \u00a31 127 worse off and as we heard in the previous debate higher vat has left people \u00a31 800 worse off over four years for people at the bottom end of the income spectrum such sums are the difference between being able to put food on the table and to put clothes on their children\u2019s back or not while the choices for those at the other end of the income spectrum who are benefiting from a tax cut to the tune of \u00a3100 000 are probably about the poshness of the car on the forecourt of their home not the basic necessities of life and of survival that is the important point for struggling families across our country ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the hon member for redcar (ian swales) always takes part in finance bill debates and he always makes one point in exactly the same way i sometimes wish that he would listen to the answer he gets when he does so the answer is that the top rate was increased as a specific response to get down the deficit after the global financial crisis it was the fair and right thing to do then it was unfair and wrong to decrease the rate from 50p to 45p which he as a member of one of the parties of government supported it will be right for the next labour government to raise it to 50p again ", "one of the things about the annual debate on the 50p rate is that the usual suspects make the same points in exactly the same way we have heard that point from several members of the hon gentleman\u2019s party i say to him what i have always said that we have had a consistent approach to the top rate of tax there has been no change to that and we will put it up to 50p if we are elected in a few short weeks\u2019 time we can look at the difference between people at the top and bottom end of the income spectrum the millionaires who have had a huge tax cut and are \u00a3100 000 a year better off and the people who are struggling and \u00a31 100 a year worse off how must it feel to the ordinary taxpayer and to hundreds of thousands of people working on zero-hours contracts to be told that while they struggle on a tiny number of people in our country will be given a tax cut that could buy a house in many parts of the country including my own city that is the stark reality of the choices that the government have made the government\u2019s last budget has told people what is coming the spending cuts that the chancellor has proposed for the next three years will be deeper than those in the past five years and things will continue to be tight for many families they want to know that the load is being shared fairly but that one decision tells us that it is not ", "if the hon gentleman will allow me i will answer that by posing a simple question back to him and then i will give way so that he can answer it where will the \u00a312 billion of cuts to welfare come from how will the \u00a35 billion for tax avoidance be found if he can answer those questions he will go further than those on his front bench have managed to do while making those promises perhaps he can shed some light on the issue for the british public ", "that was not even a valiant attempt to try to answer my questions but the hon gentleman is not on the front bench and i suppose i am being a little uncharitable in suggesting that he cannot answer a question that his own chancellor is not prepared to answer either we have numbers of \u00a312 billion \u00a313 billion and \u00a35 billion from the chancellor yet with all the might of the treasury behind him and lots of officials to do the numbers we have no detail on how those figures will be found the government spent a whole parliament trying to talk up their record on tax avoidance and they are saying that they will get \u00a35 billion in the next parliament yet there is no detail on how those amounts will be made up and no guarantee that they will be delivered i am not surprised that the hon gentleman cannot answer those questions if those on the government front bench will not either the conservative party\u2019s plans for what they would like to do if elected in a few weeks\u2019 time are extreme and go much further than deficit reduction they are trying to deliver a surplus of \u00a37 billion that had to be changed from the previous desire to get a surplus of \u00a323 billion because the government got spooked by recognition across the country of what that would mean for the size of the state they have now come down to \u00a37 billion which still means that they have to go further and faster in the early part of the next parliament than they have in the previous five years those choices have to be paid for given that some budgets are protected and that commitments to international development and aid spending will not change and given the scale of what the conservative party wants to achieve with the country\u2019s finances it is physically not possible to do such things without putting the nhs at risk of cuts or potentially of charging or of raising vat that is the charge being made it is not just about the history and the record the hon gentleman could have resiled from the conservative party\u2019s record but he chose not to do so the combination of the conservative party\u2019s history on vat and its figures for the next parliament tells us that if it is elected a vat rise is coming there can be no doubt about it given the combination of those two factors the hon gentleman attacked our plans and commitments but for every commitment that involves raising revenue we have highlighted where that revenue will come from and we have made the figures public it was the labour party that called for the obr to conduct an independent audit of all parties\u2019 manifesto commitments we could have avoided this debate if we had allowed the obr to do so i was very happy to submit my party\u2019s plans to an independent audit i wonder why the government chose not to do so perhaps they had something to hide perhaps they did not want to be robbed of the ability to have a  tax bombshell -type poster the needs of the conservative party\u2019s electionmarketing material should not have trumped the responsible thing to do to allow the obr independently to audit all parties\u2019 manifesto commitments i was very happy for that to happen the bankers\u2019 bonus tax would pay for one policy and one policy alone the compulsory youth jobs guarantee [interruption ] if the hon gentleman thinks the stubbornly high rate of youth unemployment is a laughing matter he is mistaken the conservatives stole a few of our policies in last week\u2019s budget rather than laughing off the idea of the bankers\u2019 bonus tax i would have been happy for them to have stolen that policy as it would have delivered jobs for the young people in my constituency who could find themselves on the jobs scrap-heap for many years to come the conservatives should have adopted it it would have made a real and practical difference ", "my hon friend is absolutely right we have been debating whether vat will go up but new clause 1 is pretty innocuous it calls only for a review and an assessment of the impact the rise in vat has had on living standards if the minister wanted us to believe what the prime minister said today in prime minister\u2019s questions that he is ruling out a rise in vat then what is the problem adopt the new clause add it to the bill and let us have the assessment he would be able to show how vat has had an impact and why the conservatives are doing such a good job if they are elected again in not letting it go up ", "my hon friend is absolutely right that is the only conclusion we can draw from what the minister and the prime minister have been saying today if the minister really wanted to back up the prime minister\u2019s claims and to give us a hint that he might be believed he should have just accepted our new clause it is straightforward and adding it to the bill would shine some light on the impact of vat we are very clear that we will not raise vat it may be that the government do not want the facts out in the public domain because they plan to do so ", "i am going to finish now because i want to give time to everybody else who wishes to speak in the debate we all know what is coming if the conservatives are elected at the next general election vat will go up that is what their record tells us and that is what their plans require if the minister wants to be even a little bitbelievable even 1% believable he should at the very least accept new clause 1 and set the cat among the pigeons but i do not think he will take that opportunity today ", "i have a lot of time for the hon gentleman and we spend much time debating finance bills but i must say to him as gently as i can that that was an absurd intervention we have made a clear commitment to the british people on what will happen to vat on our watch it will not go up we know that it will go up if his party wins the next general election there are no two ways about it it does not matter what the prime minister has said and it does not matter what the hon gentleman says now we know that because of his party\u2019s record and form on vat i shall give a lengthy exposition of that history and form very shortly ", "if the hon gentleman gives me a few minutes i shall get on to that point very shortly he will understand that the past performance and form of the people who sit opposite me today the conservatives is the clearest and surest indicator unfunded tax cuts have already been promised and spending plans have been made that require a government to cut further and faster in the early part of the next parliament than they have in this parliament and that is the clearest indication we can get they can do nothing else but put up vat that is their tax of choice when it comes to raising the tax revenues they are looking for as i have said the independent institute for fiscal studies has said that the government\u2019s budget plans mean that spending cuts after the election will be twice as deep as anything seen in the past five years the cuts will go deeper and be made faster in the early part of the next parliament than we have seen during the past five years in reality that will translate into extreme cuts to our crucial front-line public services such as the police defence and social care the cuts will be so deep that they will be almost impossible to achieve first without putting the nhs at risk and secondly without making a further rise in vat on the tories\u2019 watch simply inevitable not only do the choices that the government and the conservatives in particular have made about spending and deficit reduction make such a vat rise inevitable regardless of the prime minister\u2019s bluster today they areingrained in their collective dna before the 1979 general election the then shadow chancellor geoffrey howe said we have absolutely no intention of doubling vat he specifically talked about doubling it in his first budget however he raised vat from 8% to 15% conservative members may take comfort from the fact that eight times two is 16 not 15 but they should not be proud of a seven percentage points rise in vat or show off about its not being the eight percentage points rise that it might have been given that such a rise had been absolutely ruled out and that there was no intention to double vat [interruption ] such a point brought no comfort to people who ended up paying the 15% rate of vat despite what the financial secretary who is chuntering from a sedentary position seems to think in 1991 chancellor norman lamont increased vat from 15% to 17 5% claiming that his approach was  consistent with the  strategy for tax reform first set out by geoffrey howe in the 1979 budget chancellor lamont was correct that the approach was consistent it was consistent with the approach of raising vat rather than doing anything else it seems that that approach may have slipped his mind because just a year later before the 1992 general election norman lamont told parliament that he again made it clear that the united kingdom has no intention of changing our vat rate [official report 13 june 1991 vol 192 c 627w ]that promise was reiterated by the former prime minister john major when he promised parliament there will be no vat increase unlike the labour party we have published our spending plans and there is no need for us to raise vat to meet them [official report 28 january 1992 vol 202 c 808 ]he also said that year that he had no plans and no need to raise extra resources from value-added tax the arguments then are almost exactly same as those we are hearing now will government members remind us what happened after the 1992 election there are no takers because they know the answer the conservatives remember their consistent approach to raising vat the then chancellor introduced vat on domestic heating and fuel in the 1993 budget phasing it in at 8% from 1994 when he became chancellor in 1993 the right hon and learned member for rushcliffe (mr clarke) refused to reverse that increase saying that no one is going to die from vat on heating that is a very bad way of making a point because people have in fact ended up dying from the cold we know that people the elderly in particular often have to choose between heating their home and eating had it not been for a labour defeat in the house of commons under the conservatives we would have seen vat on electricity and gas bills increase to 17 5% in april 1995 twenty years later we find ourselves listening to a familiar story before the last general election the prime minister the then leader of the opposition said we have no plans to put up vat it\u2019s not part of our plans i like the double emphasis say it twice and that might make it true the chancellor the then shadow chancellor said the plans we set out involved around 80 per cent of the work coming from spending restraint cuts and about 20 per cent from tax increases the tax increases are already in place the plans do not involve an increase in vat so such a rise was ruled out by the prime minister and by the chancellor when they were in opposition however just weeks after taking office like all the former conservative chancellors before him the current chancellor increased vat to achieve his plans of 20% consolidation coming from tax increases and 80% coming from spending cuts he said to achieve that additional tightening while maintaining the right \u2018four-to-one\u2019 balance between spending and taxation means that i have to announce further tax rises today on 4 january next year the main rate of vat will rise from 17 5% to 20% [official report 22 june 2010 vol 512 c 177 ]there is no doubt that such a rise has hit family budgets hard despite knowing that that would happen and that there would be a huge impact on the economy as a whole the chancellor chose to do what every conservative chancellor has always chosen to do put up vat that is why we can say so emphatically i say this to liberal democrat members in particular that if the tories are elected at the general election in just a few weeks\u2019 time they will do it again it is in their collective dna and ruling it out but then doing it is precisely what they have form for that is their history and i believe that they will honour their history if they are elected analysis produced by the treasury in july 2010 showed the estimated impact of a one percentage point rise in the standard rate of vat that analysis means that we know for instance that in the past four years the government\u2019s vat rise has cost a single pensioner \u00a3500 a one-parent family \u00a3900 a pensioner couple \u00a31 100 and a couple with children \u00a31 800 ", "i was just about to make exactly that point my hon friend is absolutely right that in 2012 having already done what all conservative chancellors do and put up vat the chancellor sought to expand it by applying it to pasties and caravans in the so-called omnishambles budget i have always thought that it was a bit of a shame that that term from  the thick of it was used because if the sequence of events that unfolded following that budget had been presented to the scriptwriters of  the thick of it they would not have touched it they would have said that even for  the thick of it it was an unbelievable series of events yet that is what the chancellor delivered my hon friend is absolutely right that the chancellor tried to expand the scope of vat yet today the conservatives wonder why nobody will believe what the prime minister said at prime minister\u2019s questions we do not have to go back over the past 20 or 30 years we can just look at the record of the current chancellor and prime minister on vat they like toput it up and they sought to expand its application i noticed that earlier the financial secretary appeared to rule out an expansion of vat but i was not entirely sure whether he had done that deliberately will he intervene on me to confirm that not only will vat not go up that is according to the prime minister although i do not believe it but it will not be expanded i wonder why the financial secretary is not biting my arm off to intervene and confirm that ", "i am grateful ", "so basically both those things are definitely going to happen if the financial secretary\u2019s party is elected in a few weeks\u2019 time where are we today the same old tories and the same old story whatever the prime minister has said today simply will not answer the justifiable charge against the government about why they should be trusted if we look only at their record and at what they have delivered in this parliament they broke their promise after the last general election and they will do the same after the next one at the end of each parliament since 1979 in which the tories have been in government they have raised an average of \u00a313 5 billion from vat changes the electorate know that when it comes to vat and the tories actions will always speak louder than words people know that they cannot be trusted because they break their promises again and again they broke their promises in 1979 1992 and 2010 and they will break them in 2015 according to work by the treasury an additional 2 5% rise in vat would cost a family with children an average of \u00a3450 a year and a pensioner couple \u00a3275 a year from what they have shown us in government it is not tory party policy to ask those most able to contribute more to do so in fact it is their policy to give a tax cut to those earning more than \u00a3150 000 a year ", "for the avoidance of doubt and for what feels like the 278th time in treasury debates i should tell the minister that the bank bonus tax will pay for one policy and only one policy the paid starter jobs the compulsory jobs guarantee why do the government not match us on that policy rather than harp on about their failed rhetoric on the bank bonus tax ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr hood new clause 1 stands in my name and those of my right hon friend the member for morley and outwood (ed balls) and my hon friends the members for nottingham east (chris leslie) and for kilmarnock and loudoun (cathy jamieson) it requests the treasury to commission a report on the impact of the increase in the standard rate of vat which took effect from 4 january 2011 the report must estimate the impact of that increase on living standards small businesses the fairness of the taxation system and economic growth the house has debated issues relating to vat on a number of occasions which the minister referenced in his opening remarks and it was of course a hot topic of debate at prime minister\u2019s questions today if the prime minister or any conservative members think that they can put the issue to bed today let me tell them that they will not find it that easy and i will set out the reasons for that during the course of my speech frankly to believe what the prime minister has said today about vat would be rather like believing what the deputy prime minister said about tuition fees before the last general election the public are simply not going to buy it and i think the whole house is well aware of that our new clause asks for a review because oppositions are limited in what they can call for in amendments to a finance bill but no member can be in any doubt about our argument about the consequences of the political choices that are being and that have been made by the conservative party and signed up to by the liberal democrats even though they have been desperately trying to pretend that they had nothing to do with the fiscal assumptions given to the obr on the basis of which it made its assessments of what is likely to happen in the next parliament i welcome to the debate the lone liberal democrat on the government benches the hon member for burnley (gordon birtwistle) perhaps if i give way to him he can rule out raising vat ", "thank you mr hood i am grateful for the hon gentleman\u2019s intervention during which he did not rule out a rise in vat under the liberal democrats perhaps we will have to wait for others to comment on that ", "my hon friend is absolutely right that is exactly what people across the country will be concerned about the conservative party has form which i will go into in detail during my speech history proves that what the prime minister said at question time today should not be believed because it has all been said before and vat has always gone up ", "i give way to the rover from dover ", "i will come on to what we announced yesterday but we are not going to raise vat that is as clear as it gets and the hon gentleman knows that i remind the committee that vat is the tax that hits everyone with the same rate paid by the pensioner as by the millionaire for many pensioners and those on the lowest incomes it is the biggest tax that they pay it is also the tax that hits people every single day whether they are buying a cup of coffee or filling up the family car everybody does that every single day the government\u2019s decision to raise the standard rate of vat has without doubt hit the living standards of millions of people according to the treasury\u2019s own figures it has cost families an average of \u00a31 800 over the past four years that is no small trifling sum of money even if it is averaged over four years as i heard from constituents across birmingham when i was there with the shadow chancellor yesterday \u00a31 800 has had a huge impact on their ability to make ends meet and to do the basic things in life putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their families\u2019 heads desperately hoping they will not have to go to a food bank even though they have a job just to put food in the bellies of their children that \u00a31 800 is a significant sum of money and coupled with the other facts of this government\u2019s record such as wages being down by an average of \u00a31 600 a year and the combined impact of tax and benefit changes families are on average more than \u00a31 000 a year worse off those are significant sums of money and that is why i was proud to join the shadow chancellor in birmingham yesterday when he made a crystal clear pledge to the british people that a labour government will not raise vat or extend vat to food children\u2019s clothes books newspapers and public transport fares in their budget the conservatives confirmed their intentions for extreme spending cuts in the next parliament and we have heard about that in the debate this afternoon we also know from the point made by my hon friend the shadow chief secretary to the treasury that the conservatives have made \u00a310 billion-worth of unfunded tax promises with five weeks left until the election we are still waiting to hear how those promises on tax cuts will be paid for i will happily give way to the minister if he wants to shed some light on the matter but he appears to be unwilling to intervene that is a shame because in his opening speech on this clause he talked with great flourish about credibility credibility gaps and ensuring that people know what they are voting for if people make an unfunded tax promise their credibility will take a huge hit and rightly so when the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister were in opposition they were happy to talk up the fact that nobody believes an unfunded tax cut and they were absolutely right nobody believes them now if they are going to deliver that we should at least hear how they will start paying for it if they want to see off the charge that vat will go up under the tories if they win the next general election regardless of what the prime minister said in questions today they need to start answering some of the questions about the unfunded tax cuts that they have already promised ", " rose ", "i am grateful to the financial secretary as we have been in the chamber he may not be aware that we have ruled out any rise in national insurance ", "i have only a short time in which to speak so let me start by saying that we have heard some very good speeches today the debate was opened powerfully by the shadow chief secretary my hon friend the member for nottingham east (chris leslie) my hon friends the members for islwyn (chris evans) for edmonton (mr love) and for swansea west (geraint davies) all spoke well the rover from dover will live long in our memories and trumps i think  dover soul which is not really up to the mark in quite the same way i pay tribute to my hon friend the member for edmonton who made his valedictory speech today i am sorry that he had to cut his remarks short but i wish to put it on the record that he has had a very distinguished period of service in this house it has always been a pleasure to sit in debates on treasury matters and to hear him speak i have learned a huge amount from him his service on the treasury committee has been to his credit and he has a record of which he can be proud the house and his constituents will miss him greatly as my hon friend the shadow chief secretary said in his opening remarks the budget is as fundamental as it gets when it comes to the business of the government and the finance act the legislation that enacts most of that budget is also fundamental but effectively the vast majority of this bill will go through without debate i confess that the negotiations into which i entered with the financial secretary last week was my first experience of the wash-up although i acknowledge the hard work done by his officials and even by him in terms of the tenor with which he approached those discussions neither of us can pretend that this is a satisfactory way in which to make very complex taxation legislation in particular we know that outside commentators have an eye today on the diverted profits tax the opposition have to make a judgment call based on often very little or last minute com information for example we have to judge whether blocking something now so that we can do it better later would give a signal that it will not happen at all and so cause uncertainty or whether an appropriate reassurance can be made i know about the lively discussions outside the house about the diverted profits tax let me just say that we support the thrust of what the government intend to do but the bill was being drafted at the end of last week when the minister and i were trying to conclude our negotiations that is unsatisfactory because the bill is complex in our first finance bill when we are in government we will seek to remedy any defects that prevent that measure from being both effective and strong i am happy to let it through not because i think that it is a completely 100% foolproof bit of work but because i fear that the tories in opposition might not be quite so keen to see the measure on the statute book i wanted to ensure that we got it passed and then we could fix any issues later although we will support many of the measures now going through later we will debate the measures that we think are missing we think that the bill is a missed opportunity as my three hon friends who spoke from the back benches all said the government could and should have taken the opportunity really to start making a difference to the lives of our constituents across thecountry but they failed to do so only a labour government and a labour finance bill immediately after the general election will start putting those matters right ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer with reference to the contribution of edward troup in oral evidence to the committee of public accounts on 5 november 2012 hc716 question 60 what progress has been made on the further dozen pending

", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer what the value of penalties collected by hm revenue and customs as a result of criminal convictions relating to tax avoidance and evasion was in each of the last five years ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship ms dorries i congratulate the hon member for ceredigion (mr williams) on securing this debate and on his work to highlight the issue we have heard some excellent and important contributions that have reminded us of the importance of tourism to uk plc and the case has been passionately made for reducing vat below the standard rate of 20% on services supplied to tourists in order to improve the sector\u2019s international competitiveness as we have heard member states\u2019 discretion to set lower rates on goods and services is limited by european vat law but there is a special dispensation for a lower rate on certain supplies associated with tourism specifically including hotel accommodation certain restaurant services and some types of admission charge including charges for entry to amusement parks some member states have made use of that dispensation to charge lower rates including the republic of ireland which introduced a lower rate of 9% in july 2011 we heard a bit more about that from some hon members in their contributions the campaign is long-running this is the second debate on the topic in which i have taken part the previous one took place almost exactly a year ago ahead of last year\u2019s budget and was secured by the hon member for south down (ms ritchie) the hon member for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) and the hon member for strangford (jim shannon) from whom we have just heard the hon member for ceredigion made a powerful opening speech focused partly on his constituency and the impact that a vat reduction could have on the welsh economy he also made the point about a potential link between a vat cut and economic growth i take slight issue with his assertion that the labour opposition have not been robust in our approach to this matter we have been robust but unfortunately the answer that we have arrived at is similar to the government\u2019s rather than being the answer that he and others hoped for those hoping for a different answer from us and the government include members of our own party i acknowledge the role of labour back-bench members in the campaign including that of my hon friend the member for is it ynys m\u00f4n ", "i thank my hon friend i hate to get people\u2019s constituency names wrong so i am glad to have got it right on this occasion he made the point that it is welsh tourism week and welsh members of parliament from various parties have been well represented in this debate i recognise his long history of campaigning on this issue and particularly his focus on the number of jobs and the amount of economic growth that such achange could create in his constituency and the welsh economy as a whole i fully expect him to continue lobbying labour colleagues and a future labour treasury on the issue as he has done alongside others throughout this parliament but i am afraid that i will disappoint him and other hon members throughout the house once again by not making a commitment that the next labour government will reduce vat for the tourism sector in the way that they envisage ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that intervention i was just about to develop a point about the evidence presented by hon members in this debate and how we will react to it if we form the next labour government and treasury i start by recognising that cutting vat is a significant monetary challenge the opposition are clear that we will put no unfunded promises in our manifesto the basis on which we will seek election from the public in the coming weeks and we will not borrow any more money for day-to-day spending we note the evidence presented by hon members in this debate from notable academics who have considered the issue in detail it has been cited in support of the argument by the cut tourism vat campaign from opposition i am not in a position to assess that evidence in the same way that the treasury can as it has access to data sets that we do not but i note the minister\u2019s answers to hon members in written parliamentary answers and oral answers during departmental question time in the house he has said on the basis of analysis undertaken by the treasury that a vat cut for the sector would not produce sufficient economic growth to outweigh the consequent revenue shortfall it would be helpful if in summing up the minister put more of that evidence on the record if the position is the same as before ", "the hon gentleman will know that in the early part of this parliament we proposed an alternative package to the government as an immediate measure to stimulate the economy it envisaged a temporary vat cut which at the time could have made a difference across the whole economy and might have meant being in a different position today i note though that the previous labour government when lobbied on the issue felt that targeting the cut in the way then envisaged would not necessarily have produced the effects anticipated by hon members that is why it would be helpful to hear more from the minister about current treasury thinking and analysis of the available evidence an incoming labour treasury would certainly want to consider all that evidence and see the analysis at first hand in particular we would want to understand the relationship between different measures that could be taken including a potential vat tax cut compared with for example the government have also cited this in defence of their position the employment allowance a \u00a32 000 rebate on employer national insurance contributions introduced by the government earlier in this parliament i would also want to be convinced that we would achieve as close to 100% pass-through of such a big change if we were to start considering seriously the case for making it however we return to the fact that if we cut vat in that way the most recent office for national statistics data from 2012 suggest an annual cost to the exchequer of \u00a311 billion to \u00a312 billion those sums would have to be found elsewhere and we as an incoming labour government would not be in a position to make that choice so i cannot commit to a vat cut of the nature called for by the campaign although i can of course commit if i become a treasury minister after the election in may to assessing the analysis and all available evidence i will also work with colleagues in the department for business innovation and skills and the department for culture media and sport to examine what else can be done to assist the tourism sector and ensure that it plays its full part in encouraging sustained and balanced economic growth i am sure that the cut tourism vat campaign will continue to make its case in full heart in the life of the next parliament it is certainly made up of doughty parliamentary campaigners i look forward to engaging with them in much the same way that i know the minister has engaged with them thus far in this parliament tourism is a hugely important sector to the uk it is our fourth largest service industry it employs 9 6% of the uk work force or 3 1 million people it generates 9% of the uk\u2019s entire gdp and in 2013 it contributed \u00a3127 billion to the economy so it is in everybody\u2019s interests to ensure that the sector grows thrives and continues to provide the jobs necessary for uk plc as i highlighted in our debate on tourism last year there are other policy levers that can be pulled without the cost implications that a vat cut on tourism would entail which would still be of real benefit to the sector one of the most effective of those levers could be around immigration policy particularly given the complexity around fees visa applications and the monitoring required to make sure that people do not overstay their visa the government have made particular changes with respect to some countries such as china however it is the case that other countries are deemed to be a high risk for potential overstaying but whose genuine visitors are often locked out i see that in my own constituency with visitors who want to come from the indian subcontinent but the immigration officials almost take a first view that those people are more likely to overstay than not often that is not the case people want to come to the uk to see the land that their forefathers left their countries of origin for and they wish to come and celebrate family events such as weddings they will spend money here and their british citizen relativeswill spend money showing them a good time and showing them what britain is all about we should assist that process and not hold it back therefore although i cannot agree for the cut that has been called for i commend the work of the cut tourism vat campaign and the work of its supporters in the house we will continue to work closely with the tourism sector and we look forward to hearing more from the campaigners in the future ", "i am grateful for that intervention i do not have a fundamental objection in principle to that idea but i am not in a position to commit to a formal review of some kind nevertheless as i have said if i was in the treasury i would happily look at any additional evidence and at the treasury\u2019s analysis of the data at first hand rather than hearing it from the minister ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer what discussions he has had with the prime minister on hsbc and tax evasion since may 2010 ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer whether any minister in his department discussed the declaration concerning the acquistion of customer data stolen from swiss banks with lord green during his time as minister for trade and investment ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer when ministers in his department were first made aware of the findings of the us senate homeland security sub-committee that led to hsbc being fined  1 9bn in december 2012 ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer in how many cases related to tax evasion did failure to agree a rate of penalty go on appeal to the first-tier tribunal (tax) or upper tribunal (tax and chancery chamber) and result in a penalty that was (a) the same as the original amount (b) a greater amount or (c) a lower amount in the last five years ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer how many cases a taxpayer settled with hm revenue and customs for a penalty less than that initially set by the investigating inspector in each of the last five years ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer whether his department carried out an impact assessment on the future implications of signing its agreement with the swiss confederation on co-operation in the area of taxation ", "the minister must acknowledge the significant damage that the recent hsbc tax avoidance and evasion scandal has done to the public\u2019s confidence in the government\u2019s willingness to pursue tax avoiders and evaders thereby reducing the amount of uncollected tax in the uk in the chancellor\u2019s absence will the minister now answer the question that the chancellor failed to answer six times on the  today programme did the chancellor ever discuss tax evasion at hsbc with lord green yes or no ", "still we have no answer to the simplest and clearest of questions if we cannot get a straight answer from the chancellor or his ministers we should at least hear from lord green the man who was in charge of the bank and was then made a conservative minister either in front of a parliamentary committee or through a statement in the other place why are the government parties so desperate to silence lord green what are they so afraid he will reveal ", "i would like to associate myself with the minister\u2019s comments about the quality of our debate thus far on the bill we have had a thorough discussion it has been shorter than originally anticipated but that is becausethe bill has wide-ranging support across the house and it is a pleasure to rise once again to support the measures in it we are committed as are members across the house to supporting measures to increase inward investment into northern ireland and support the much-needed rebalancing of its economy we have all recognised that northern ireland has lagged behind the rest of the uk on productivity and prosperity over the years measures have been implemented to boost the northern ireland economy including through increased levels of investment and job creation programmes but few have met with long-term success it is important to consider a measure that would put a rocket-booster under the approaches taken so far to rebalancing and strengthening northern ireland\u2019s economy in that spirit we have supported the bill as i noted in committee the bill is both straightforward and complicated it is short in respect of the number of clauses but those clauses include a huge amount of detail some of which has still to be worked out the minister alluded to that in his comments it is important to recognise that we are at the start-point rather than the end stage of the process let me draw out a couple of issues that will be the subject of live discussions between the uk government and the northern ireland executive before i do so however let me reinforce a point made in the intervention by the hon member for north down (lady hermon) that it would be a mistake to think that corporation tax devolution will in and of itself do what is needed to rebalance northern ireland\u2019s economy it has to be part of a much wider picture that includes other policy drivers to help make this measure a success that is certainly the experience of the republic of ireland whose extremely low corporation tax does not sit alone it is supported by other policy measures particularly on skills and infrastructure if this bill is to be a success in northern ireland it will be important for all parties work to together to ensure that the rest of the policy framework is in place to allow the rebalancing that we all want to happen ", "the hon gentleman is right to say that the perception of business is really important but he will recognise i think a point that businesses often make to members of all parties that headline rates of corporation tax are extremely important for decisions about where to locate businesses but that they are not the only factor that businesses take into account i recognise the importance of this bill for northern ireland given the unique situation in which northern ireland finds itself as i say it is putting a rocket-booster under the approach taken so far to try to rebalance the northern ireland economy but it will not succeed on its own it has to be part of a wider policy framework despite recognition of the importance of a wider policy framework we have not yet heard a huge amount of detail about what it will look like on the ground in northern ireland these are matters largely for the northern ireland executive but they need to know and to hear that the opposition support them in having a wider framework of policy measures around skills and infrastructure that will help to make all this a success which we all want to see ", "i give way first to the hon lady ", "i am grateful for the hon lady\u2019s intervention but i am afraid that i am going to disappoint her a little because my reading of the bill what it is intended to achieve and of the agreement that has been struck is very similar to that of the minister i agree with him that a deliberate part of the agreement relates to trading profits under the new northern ireland regime corporation tax is to be devolved only in so far as it relates to trading profits rather than other aspects of business that part of the policy is designed to make it successful and ensure that this devolution results in a genuine rebalancing of northern ireland\u2019s economy with respect i feel that takes care of the point about the credit unions i have some sympathy with the argument when it comes to the progressive building society i have received communication from it about how it feels it will be caught unfairly by these provisions i felt that the amendment tabled by the hon member for foyle (mark durkan) did not take care of the scope for profit shifting within the financial services sector we are all alive to that threat but i am afraid that the amendment did not deal satisfactorily with the problem that the good work of the progressive in northern ireland could slip through and be accounted for whereas everything else that could result in profit shifting would be excluded to that extent my reading is similar to that of the minister and that will certainly be our approach i am happy to give an undertaking dependent on the outcome of the general election to continue a debate with members who feel strongly about this point as did the minister ", "i do not want to repeat a lengthy debate on credit unions but i will give way to the hon lady one final time ", "with respect to the hon lady the whole scope of the northern ireland regime under the bill relates to trading profits credit unions do not pay corporation tax on their trading profits so this bill does not impact on them i am not sure how many ways there are of saying that i feel that the different formulations of the point have probably been covered if the credit unions did pay corporation tax on their trading profits we would be having a different discussion if members wish to see a devolution regime for northern ireland that includes activities other than trading profits so that corporation tax would be paid on investments income and so forth that is a big call to make if provisions were to be applied but limited to credit unions alone it would mean carving out an exception to the regime let me say that that goes beyond the context of the agreement struck between this government and the northern ireland executive the agreement that we have supported and the agreement that is the subject matter of the bill i would have a huge amount of sympathy if credit unions found themselves caught because they did pay corporation tax on their trading profits but that is not the case so ", "i am grateful madam deputy speaker and i will move on to the rest of my remarks ", "forgive me but because of time considerations i will not let me raise a couple of issues that received lengthy debate in committee and will be important aspects of the work needed to take the bill forward i speak particularly of the block grant i am grateful for the letter that the minister sent to the public bill committee further setting out the government\u2019s approach to calculating the element of the block grant that the northern ireland executive will have to pay back to the uk government we are still a long way from a nail-down formula as it were for how the block grant reduction will be calculated particularly in respect of measuring and calculating behavioural effects that will need to be taken into account i note the indication in one of the appendices to the letter that the devolution of corporation tax to the northern ireland executive in 2019-20 is expected to cost about \u00a3325 million if northern ireland opts for a 12 5% rate rather than the united kingdom\u2019s 20% rate but much more work will need to be done on that and an agreement will need to be struck with the northern ireland executive ", "the right hon gentleman is persistent i will give way to him very briefly ", "with respect responding to the right hon gentleman\u2019s intervention would lead me into a much lengthier discussion on a matter that is not directly relevant to the bill however he has put his point on the record once again and i am sure that he is pleased about that as i was saying it is clear that the methodology for calculating behavioural changes in particular will require detailed work between the united kingdom government and the northern ireland executive the minister said in committee that there would be pressure on the executive to take account of any profit shifting that might occur indeed it is in their interest to limit profit shifting in order not to increase the amount that they must pay back to the treasury the minister said that a memorandum of understanding would be drawn up between the uk government and the northern ireland executive in respect of the costs of policing the limitation of profit shifting and the processes governance and accountability that would be needed for assessment of the activity that is an important part of the framework but we have not been given many details so far we all hope that the devolution will go ahead in 2017 but a potential stumbling block is the condition that northern ireland\u2019s finances must be put on a stable footing before that can happen we have still not been told exactly what that will mean and what threshold the executive will have to cross in order to prove that they have met the condition i hoped that the minister might give some idea of the timetable agreed between the uk government and the executive in relation to when some of the key decisions will have to be made i trust that they will be made well before 2017 although the minister said in committee that that was the deadline because there is a great deal to be done between now and then i think that we shall all have to return the issue of conditionality after the general election we are in favour of all measures that will assist the people of northern ireland and their economy it is in the interests of the whole united kingdom for northern ireland\u2019s economy to be rebalanced and strengthened we therefore support the bill and will continue to support it ", "to ask the prime minister whether he carried out due diligence before recommending the appointment of lord green to the house of lords in september 2010 ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer whether any ministers in his department discussed allegations of money laundering at hsbc with lord green during

contributions my hon friend the member for glasgow north east (mr bain) spoke powerfully about youth unemployment and the danger of insecure employment i think that government members are too often unwilling to engage with the difficulties posed by insecure employment and not only for those individuals working on zero-hours contracts but for the economy as a whole my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton (liz mcinnes) made an interesting point about the experiences of members of her family who have worked in banks and the pressures put on ordinary bank workers to meet selling targets it is the ordinary workers in banks who are often first in line for abuse when a scandal hits rather than the small number of individuals at the top of those institutions who might have engaged in the reckless behaviour my hon friend the member for bishop auckland (helen goodman) made a speech that was a tour de force she spoke about how banking has not served her region the north-east particularly well she made an interesting point about the dangers of crowdfunding which the hon member for redcar (ian swales) also mentioned her points about financial exclusion and the failures of regular banking to serve all our communities particularly those at the lower end of the economic spectrum were very well made and they had not been picked up by others in the debate as my hon friend the shadow financial secretary set out in her opening remarks the time has come for bonuses to be a reward for exceptional performance not compensation for failure with the bonus season upon us this debate is a timely reminder that the public remain rightly angry about the many banking scandals we have seen and that they will be astonished if they see failure continue to be rewarded with sums of money so far out of the reach of working people on lower and middle incomes our banking sector is vital to the uk economy banking and insurance make up 8% of the uk economy and provide employment for up to 2 million people without the banks individual consumers would be unable to save and borrow and businesses would not have access to the finance they need in order to grow and create high-quality well-paid jobs the importance of banking for individuals businesses and uk plc means that it is vital that our banking system is underpinned by the principles of fairness trust and transparency the next labour government will restore those principles to the banking sector too often fundamental trust in the system has been shaken by behaviour that has been unfair reckless unethical or a combination of all three 2014 was arecord year for fines in the city of london the fca levied \u00a31 1 billion on five banks including hsbc and rbs for their part in the forex fixing scandal and four uk banks barclays hsbc rbs and lloyds have paid \u00a31 5 billion in compensation for mis-selling interest rate hedging products which we have debated on a number of occasions in the chamber we have also had the libor and ppi mis-selling scandals trust and confidence have been fundamentally shaken by the recent revelations about the swiss arm of hsbc helping its customers to avoid and evade tax on the one hand customers have been exploited and on the other hand the taxpayer has been ripped off that unacceptable state of affairs is made worse by the fact that the sector has not fulfilled some of its core functions banks must provide basic borrowing and saving facilities for consumers and finance for businesses so that they can either start up or grow however we know that net lending to business has fallen by over \u00a355 billion since 2010 a couple of government members made the point that of course we do not want to see irresponsible lending and suggested that businesses are actually sitting on large cash reserves and somehow the lack of lending from banks is not a big problem that is clearly not the government\u2019s view because they keep coming up with different schemes to try and encourage lending by banks schemes which have unfortunately failed to turn the situation around in any meaningful way i am sure members across the house regularly meet with business people in their constituency advice surgeries who come to us with complaints that they have viable businesses looking to grow and employ more people but they cannot get access to finance from banks this remains a key problem which the government\u2019s various schemes to try to get net lending up have unfortunately failed to resolve so there are huge fines for breaking rules and a failure to fulfil the core functions of the sector despite all this senior employees continue to receive huge bonuses we can all see that the current state of affairs is difficult to justify we know that last year\u2019s bonus round exposed the gap between pay and performance barclays and rbs increased their bonus pool despite falling profits indeed at barclays we saw a fall in profits of 32% yet the bonus pool increased by 10% we now learn that at hsbc the chief executive will receive \u00a37 6 million and 330 staff will receive more than \u20ac1 million each at a time when profits are down and the tax avoidance and evasion scandal continues to rage what are the public supposed to make of all this not much i would say the government for their part have failed to act fully on proposals for reform and have failed to provide answers on hsbc ", "i am sorry i will not because of time the government have failed to provide answers on hsbc in a way that would inspire confidence and they have wasted money challenging the eu bank bonus cap what can we do to turn this situation around it is clear that we need to reconnect the level of pay and bonuses of some highly paid bankers with the wider performance of the banks and their wider economic contribution a labour government would repeat the tax on bankers\u2019 bonuses which we introduced in 2009 to raise \u00a31 5 billion to \u00a32 billion this tax [interruption ] i will come to that point in a moment for government members this tax alongside a restriction on [interruption ]", "thank you madam deputy speaker this tax alongside a restriction on pension tax relief would fund a compulsory jobs guarantee let me deal with the point made by hon members chuntering from a sedentary position the tax would be spent only once and only for one measure that is our compulsory jobs guarantee that has been the case for as long as we have had our compulsory jobs guarantee policy i find it interesting that the only line of attack that government members have on the compulsory jobs guarantee is to imply incorrectly that the bank bonus tax is being spent more than once it is a weak line of attack from government members who do not want to engage with the substance of the policy a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term youth unemployed only one point was made about the substance of our policy which was about the potential scope for tax avoidance the first outing of the bank bonus tax introduced by the labour government had stringent anti-avoidance measures attached to it and we would repeat those measures to make sure that the tax was not aggressively avoided and that all the revenue that we expect to be raised will be realised in order to fund our proposals for a compulsory jobs guarantee ", "certainly not to a member who has just come in for the winding-up speeches if i may say so a measure such as i have described is clearly needed because we know that the latest labour force survey data show that youth unemployment was at 740 000 in the three months to december 2014 to government members who try to take comfort from some of the welcome decreases that we have seen in constituencies across the country as though that means that everything is hunky-dory i would say that 740 000 young people unemployed are 740 000 too many there is nothing to be complacent about we need a rocket booster under our approach to long-term youth unemployment that rocket booster will be provided by a tax on bank bonuses to fund a compulsory jobs guarantee government members should examine their consciences to decide whether they think that we do in fact need strong measures to tackle the scourge of youth unemployment and join us in the lobby to support our motion we need to restore trust and accountability to the sector i call on the house to support the motion and the need to take meaningful action to ensure that bonuses reward exceptional performance and that where bonuses are given they are taxed and the revenue is used to deliver the much-needed compulsory jobs guarantee ", "to ask the prime minister when and how he was first made aware of files relating to hsbc and tax evasion ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer what average time was taken by hm revenue and customs to pre-approve transfer pricing arrangements in (a) 2010-11 (b) 2011-12 (c) 2012-13 (d) 2013-14 and (e) 2014-15 to date ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr gray and to speak after the hon member for kettering (mr hollobone) who opened the debate very well i note that the last time i spoke in a westminster hall debate on this matter he was in the chair it has been good to hear his views this afternoon i welcome this debate it is important that we debate this very emotive issue in an atmosphere of calm in which hopefully reason can dominate rather than the hysteria that we sometimes see in the national media certainly there was much more hysteria the last time this issue was debated in westminster hall and religious minority communities in this country the muslim and jewish communities rightly felt picked on and unfairly scrutinised it was as if people were saying that their way of life was significantly more cruel and that they were more reckless as to the level of cruelty than any other communities which is a deeply unfair mischaracterisation of the seriousness with which practising religious minority communities in this country take their religious obligations it is clear from some interventions that significant points of disagreement will remain at the end of the debate but it is important that we continue to examine these issues in an atmosphere that as the hon member for kettering said generates light rather than heat as i have noted before i am a practising muslim so the debate matters to me on a personal level but i also represent many thousands of practising muslims and jews and both communities have written to ask me to place on the record in this debate their views and feelings it is interesting to note that the first national legislative requirement in england and wales for stunning before slaughter was in the slaughter of animals act 1933 which even then retained an exception from stunning for religious slaughter by jews and muslims that strikes me as a very british approach to an issue that is clearly of long-standing interest to both the public and legislators in this place the government have made it clear this is my understanding i hope that the minister will confirm it this afternoon that they do not intend to move away from having an exception in the law for religious non-stun slaughter i welcome that commitment on behalf of my constituents for whom this is an incredibly important issue as we have heard in the debate the key point of disagreement is of course about welfare i have to say to hon members who tried to make a distinction between a debate that is focused on religion and one that is focused on welfare that it is actually very difficult to make that distinction for those of us who are members of a religious minority in this country and who practise our faith it is very difficult to hear people say  actually we are talking about only one thing here not something else you shouldn\u2019t really feel so strongly about it thatis simply not possible to do all these issues are tied in intimately with one another and should therefore be considered in that context there will be differing views and different pieces of science that we can quote at one another in support of our respective positions on whether non-stun slaughter is or can be described as humane but one point that is often not made in these debates is that for religious minority communities the non-stun slaughter of animals must be done in a way that ensures that the animal does not suffer the whole reason for having those rules and laws in the first place was precisely to prevent the suffering of animals it is testimony to the importance of the ancient texts that laid down those laws that there was such concern for animal rights at that point that motivation and desire to ensure that an animal does not suffer needless pain is important for everyone to remember when we debate these matters i also make the point that for religious people who are looking for religious slaughter of animals before they consume meat that act itself is an act of faith because religious people who care about these issues do not take the killing of animals lightly the hon member for kettering made the point that there is no good way to kill an animal i made that exact point in the last debate but for religious communities the right to take the life of an animal is an expression of faith it is a god-given right that can be exercised only in very specific and prescribed circumstances for people who take their religious obligations seriously and who practise their religious obligations these are matters of great concern these things are not done in a way that is negligent or reckless as to what act is being committed practising muslims and jews know when they are consuming meat that as a matter of religious law they are allowed that meat only in certain circumstances they recognise that the animal had a life and then died they care about that fact before they consume that meat it is important to recognise that because often the debate happens in a way that implies that we simply do not care about the welfare of animals we just want it our way and no other way without recognising the reasons behind how those ways came about ", "i am grateful for that intervention the next part of my remarks is about precisely that labelling however before i leave the issue of welfare i want to say this point was made by the hon member for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) that enforcement of the current rules on welfare is just as important when we discuss these issues as whether religious slaughter is humane or can be done in other ways because any abuse of the current rules does not exactly inspire confidence that any additional rules that we may bring in will be followed the point about mis-stunning is really important for religious communities the risk that an animal has been mis-stunned would negate the claim that it had been slaughtered in accordance with religious rites even those who accept that stunning might be possible under a different reading of religious law would not tolerate mis-stunning which is cruel and barbaric ", "my right hon friend is absolutely right that is why it is so important that we reach the position of being able to guarantee that the current basic standards are fully realised in slaughterhouses we all need to understand better what goes on in slaughterhouses and how different types of animals are slaughtered in the current process it is important to shed more light on what goes on in slaughterhouses before moving the debate to other practices and complicating things further that may or may not be a road that we want to go down but it does not inspire confidence about enforcement if we cannot do things correctly now ", "the hon gentleman and i are entering the debate from different starting points i do not accept that non-stun slaughter is cruel or inhumane if it is done properly in accordance with jewish or islamic religious texts we must not forget that those texts lay down clear and detailed rules about for example how one animal must not witness what happens to another animal that would never apply in any of the slaughterhouses where the mechanised slaughter of large volumes of animals takes place i simply reject the basis of the hon gentleman\u2019s question i turn to the question of labelling which we have debated before i agree with the labelling of our meat and i believe that all consumers in this country should have a much better idea of where our meat comes from my perspective on the debate is shaped by being a practising muslim i have spent my whole life looking at labels and trying to work out whether something contains for example derivatives of alcohol or derivatives of pig meat for me labels that provide a lot of detail and information are a great thing because they enable me to exercise choice at the moment when i am in doubt about something i simply put it back but i may be missing out on something that i could legitimately have consumed often i rely on the good old v symbol on food which shows that it is suitable for vegans and vegetarians because i think that it must be okay for me as long as it is not a meat product that does not help me out when it comes to meat however i reject what the hon member for kettering said about the danger of too much information i simply do not buy that argument if we say that people should be able to make a choice we should ensure that their choice is fully informed if we want to shed light we should not say that that light can extend no further thanan arbitrary threshold that seems very unfair to me the hon gentleman suggested that the line should be drawn at labelling meat halal or kosher and stun or non-stun but to do so would support a debate that is about heat rather than light such a debate stigmatises certain communities and implies that their way of doing things is really bad so there must be a special label to allow people to opt out of it to say that is to forget that there is no good clean way of killing an animal it ends up dead one way or the other we ought to know more about how animals are stunned as a result many people may well make the choice that they do not want to consume meat full stop and they have the right to do so that is not a choice that i would make because i am quite well informed about these things i make my choice knowing exactly what happens when stunning does or does not take place and what happens during different types of slaughter however i believe that the majority of people in our country do not have that knowledge if we are to be champions of animal rights and animal welfare not only in our country but across the world we should be better informed as a nation detailed labelling would go a long way to supporting that the point has been made that 80% of the halal meat produced within the muslim community is stunned it is certainly true to say that large numbers of muslims have accepted the stunning of animals before slaughter and it should be open to them to make that choice clearly there is a demand for such meat because it is being produced and consumed for those of us who wish to make a different choice however it is just as important to know that our halal meat is non-stunned and to be able to rely on the label to give us true and accurate information i am all for labelling but it should be thorough it should not be introduced because we want to muddy the waters in the debate i believe that some on the other side of the argument believe that we are trying to do that when we say that a label should detail whether the stunning has been done by bolt or whatever we support that precisely because we live in the information age and people want to know what has happened to an animal we should not draw an arbitrary line that puts some communities under greater scrutiny and makes people feel threatened we should make all the information available for all to see in an age of social media it is very easy to put lots of information into the public domain so that the public who care about the matter will learn about it understand it and then apply the rules to their daily life i accept that as technology develops we should continue to re-examine the issues that we are discussing speaking from a muslim perspective it is imperative that as society and science evolve we continue to examine our jurisprudence and our approach to it however i see nothing at the moment that would support a derogation from the exception for non-stun slaughter we should ask much deeper questions about the mechanisation of our slaughter processes and the volume of meat that we produce and whether they make it difficult to maintain any kind of standards when so much meat has to be produced in such a short time it is hard to keep track of different rules and regulations i believe that that is where science as it develops should focus i see no reason for us to move away from the very british way in which we have approached the matter we have maintainedthe exception in law for many decades and i hope that the government will confirm that that exception will remain for the foreseeable future ", "we have been calling for lord green to make a full and frank statement no allegations have been made but he needs to explain what he knew about what was going on at hsbc the exchequer secretary should correct the record on what we have been requesting from the government and from lord green and say whether she agrees that he should make a full and frank statement ", "i am sorry madam deputy speaker you are quite right to admonish me the policy of having a publicly available register of beneficial ownership is a policy of the hon gentleman\u2019s own prime minister does the hon gentleman disagree with that policy ", "i am glad that the financial secretary to the treasury is giving us some answers although they are not shedding quite enough light on what actually happened let us look at the media reports in september 2010 for example everyone knew that the daily telegraph was talking about the number of hsbc customers who were involved it therefore beggars belief that the matter was not raised with stephen green when he was appointed trade minister just a few months later ", "i am grateful to the minister for giving way he is being generous does he agree that lord green\u2019s continued silence on what he knew about what was going on at hsbc is creating a climate in which more questions are being asked does he also agree that what we need and what our motion calls for is a full and frank statement from lord green about what he knew yes or no ", "i beg to move that this house notes with concern that following the revelations of malpractice at hsbc bank which were first given to the government in may 2010 just one out of 1 100 people who have avoided or evaded tax have been prosecuted calls upon lord green and the prime minister to make a full statement about lord green\u2019s role at hsbc and his appointment as a minister regrets the failure of the government\u2019s deal on tax disclosure with switzerland which has raised less than a third of the amount promised by ministers welcomes the proposals of charities and campaigning organisations for an anti-tax dodging bill and further calls on the government to clamp down on tax avoidance by introducing a penalty regime for the general anti-abuse rule which is currently too weak to be effective closing the quoted eurobonds exemption loophole ensuring that hedge funds trading shares pay the same amount of tax as other investors introducing deeming criteria to restrict false self-employment in the construction industry and scrapping the shares for rights scheme which the office for budget responsibility has warned could cost \u00a31 billion in avoidance when citizens hand over their hard-earned cash to the government in the form of taxation they do so on the basis that at some level they have faith in our system of democratic governance a system in which the government are entrusted to make decisions about how to use that money in the best interests of all their people and to keep them safe the collection of tax is a core responsibility and trust underpins the whole structure trust that if i pay my fair share so will my neighbour and trust that the rules are applied as vigorously to the sole trader as to the huge multinational and as fairly to the basic rate taxpayer as to those in the higher band however that foundation has been profoundly shaken the global crisis austerity and a series of media disclosures about the low tax bills and complex avoidance schemes of multinationals and high net worth individuals have led members of the public to question like never before whether when they pay their tax their neighbour is doing the same this week\u2019s revelation that an arm of a leading high street bank hsbc helped clients to evade and avoid tax using swiss bank accounts hassimply added fuel to an already roaring fire it seems that the government have neither the will nor the ability to get a grip on the situation which is fast spiralling out of control ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention he and i have had a number of discussions on the airwaves about these issues given that the government have failed to field any ministers to debate on those media channels he has been doing a grand job of trying to defend the indefensible but he is quite wrong the central point in what we have discovered about hsbc this week is that the data with evidence of what had happened with tax avoidance and tax evasion were handed over by the french authorities to this government in may 2010 that is the central point that is the point at which we had evidence of wrongdoing that needed to be acted on but that is not what happened ", "the hon gentleman is completely missing the point about the debate we have been having this week about the hsbc affair as i said in answer to the intervention from the hon member for wyre forest (mark garnier) we know that data with evidence of tax avoidance and tax evasion were handed over to the government in may 2010 that raises serious questions about due diligence and the appointment of lord green the man in charge of the bank at the time as a minister in this government only eight months after the data were handed over nobody on the government benches has answered the point about why that happened and i hope that the minister might try to answer some of those questions today ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point i agree and i shall come on to that a little later in my speech we have had an ever-moving ever-changing story about what the government or members of the government knew or did not know and the questions that they asked or did not ask about hsbc that goes to my central issue of trust trust is being undermined in our tax system which absolutely depends on it the government have tried to trumpet their record in recent days but i am afraid that it is not the great source of pride that they have been trying to pretend it is we know that the tax gap that is the differencebetween how much tax should be collected and how much is collected rose from \u00a331 billion in 2009-10 to \u00a333 billion in 2011-12 and now to \u00a334 billion in 2012-13 which is the information available for the latest year ", "my hon friend makes an incredibly powerful point all businesses and all individual taxpayers need to know that the tax system is based on a level playing field that nobody is getting away with gaming the system and that when the system is being gamed we have robust measures to deal with it that is profoundly pro-business and it is also in the interests of individual taxpayers uk plc and our economy as a whole ", "i am going to make a little progress then i shall give way again the famous swiss deal between the uk and swiss governments in 2011 came into force on 1 january 2013 ministers told us it would mean that british domiciles would start to be taxed on their banking deposits in swiss institutions and raise \u00a33 12 billion we are now told that this has raised just a fraction of that amount just \u00a3873 million or a shortfall of \u00a32 247 billion the government have increased opportunities for tax avoidance we know that the office for budget responsibility has warned that the government\u2019s shares for rights scheme could open a tax avoidance loophole costing hundreds of millions of pounds on page 52 of the policy costings section of the 2012 autumn statement the obr states it is hard to predict how quickly the increased scope for tax planning will be exploited this could be quantitatively significant as a quarter of the costing already arises from tax planning i have to say to the minister that it is one thing to have to close loopholes that have been an unforeseen consequence of legislative change but quite another to make changes in the full knowledge that they will lead to a loss in the tax take ", "i am surprised the hon gentleman has not done his homework if he were to read the debate on that measure in the finance bill committee he would know that concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the initial draft legislation put forward by the government in fact the government had to table 100 amendments to their own legislation at the last moment on report before the bill became law atthe time the concern was that nobody even understood what the impact of those 100 amendments would be that is why the opposition took that view at that time if all the issues relating to the 100 amendments were remedied of course we would support the thrust of that measure but that was a technical issue discussed in committee the hon gentleman does himself no favours by not knowing the detail given how much of an interest he takes in finance bill committees and how much i have enjoyed debating with him in those committees ", "i am grateful to my hon friend for his intervention which goes to the central point we need to make sure we are collecting all the tax that is owed that is fundamental not just for trust in the system for our taxpayers and businesses but for our public services that depend on that tax take ", "the hon and learned gentleman should look at last week\u2019s financial times report on tax avoidance and tax collection it compared the government\u2019s anti-avoidance measures for companies with the measures labour put in place to tackle corporate tax avoidance during its time in office it found that the tax collected by the government\u2019s measures was going to be 90% lower than under measures introduced by the previous labour government measures put in place by labour during its 13 years in power to counter corporate tax avoidance are projected to raise ten times as much over the next four years as those introduced by the current coalition government ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point i entirely agree with him and it is something i shall come to later ", "i shall deal with the substantive thrust of that intervention when i come to the general anti-abuse rule later in the context of what has been happening on the government\u2019s watch in relation to tax avoidance we have now had the shocking relations about hsbc we now learn that the government were handed information about malpractice at hsbc and that one of their first acts was to make the then boss of the bank stephen green a lord and then a trade minister richard brooks a former hmrc tax inspector and bbc reporter has said that the treasury and hmrc knew that there was a mass of evidence of tax evasion at the heart of hsbc in 2011 but that they simply washed their hands of it a damning indictment if ever there was one the consequences are clear more than 1 100 individuals were identified as allegedly guilty of tax avoidance or evasion but we are led to believe that in only one case was there sufficient evidence to prosecute in november 2012 a senior hmrc official told the times that the government had adopted  a selective prosecution policy towards cases related to hsbc later that month hmrc told the public accounts committee that another dozen criminal prosecutions were to follow however there have been none since it seems that hmrc adopted a deliberate strategy to minimise the number of prosecutions rather than pursue them which explains why just \u00a3135 million has been recouped which contrasts unfavourably with france for example which has prosecuted more cases and raised more money on the basis of fewer account files being handed over ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point we should pursue with equal vigour all those who game the rules in our country whether it be benefit fraud or tax avoidance and evasion there remain serious questions for the government to answer i hope we hear some answers from the financial secretary to the treasury to these pressing questions did he ever speak to lord green about tax avoidance and evasion at hsbc if not why not i am happy to give way to him if he wants to clarify those matters now but it does not seem as though he is willing to take up that offer i hope he will see fit to answer some of those questions in his speech the prime ministerwas asked about conversations with lord green four times during prime minister\u2019s questions today but he failed to answer each time it has been difficult to keep up with the conflicting reports about who knew what and when but today the government have claimed they knew that hsbc customers were in the frame for tax avoidance and evasion but not about any possible culpability by the bank itself it is ridiculous to suggest that despite having files showing that 1 100 customers of a bank possibly avoided or evaded tax ministers did not consider the possibility that perhaps the bank itself had a hand in it and did not bother to ask any questions of a ministerial colleague they knew was head of the bank over the period in question the government were given the data in may 2010 lord green took office in january 2011 and the swiss tax deal was signed in august 2011 in fact the minister and david hartnett the senior tax official started negotiating the swiss tax deal straight after the data on hsbc were received from the french authorities so at a time when the government knew or should have known that serious wrongdoing had been going on i think we need some answers from the minister about whether he ever discussed the swiss tax deal with lord green who was after all a colleague who had run an organisation with a swiss banking arm we need the minister to explain the conversations he had or the conversations that on reflection he now feels he should have had with colleagues in government and to clarify whether he has any regrets we also need to hear explicitly from lord green our motion calls for this with a full and frank statement about what he knew and what discussions he had with those in government about his knowledge of what was going on in the swiss arm of hsbc i also think it is about time we heard from the chancellor he has been quiet since sunday when all this started to come to light so we need to hear from him as the head of the treasury what he knew ", "there are real questions to be answered about how hmrc conducts its investigations and the rigour with which it pursues its different investigations these take place of course within the context of legislation set by this government so ultimately these are matters for the government it is also the government who decide on the amount of resources hmrc gets to do its job an issue that i have discussed with the minister on a number of occasions fundamentally the failure to act is symptomatic of the government\u2019s failure to tackle abuse within the tax system that is why people are losing faith in it our motion sets out what we would do to restore that faith in the system first we have said that we will introduce penalties for those caught by the general anti-abuse rule which is supposed to catch those who set upabusive schemes the most egregious forms of abuse however there is currently no penalty scheme association with the so-called gaar which lacks teeth a labour government would introduce a tough penalty regime with fines of up to 100% of the value of the tax avoided that will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax [interruption ] the minister says from a sedentary position that the government are now consulting on whether to have a penalties regime for the gaar but only after we announced our policy that we would have such a regime the truth is that when the gaar was introduced there was a huge amount of discussion and a review was carried out for the government with lots of academic work done on whether or not we should have a general anti-abuse rule in this country the government could and should have introduced penalties immediately where they have failed to act we will act secondly the quoted eurobond exemption is used legitimately by many companies to raise finance on the international bond market but it is also abused by some companies to shift profits out of the uk into tax havens and so reduce the amount of corporation tax they pay hmrc itself identified the problem but the government failed to act again where they failed to act we will act ", "i will not give way i want to make some progress thirdly we have had much discussion relating to ", "of course ", "at the risk of repeating our previous debate about the quoted eurobond exemption i said at the time that i was fearful that the minister was patronising me he assured me then that he was not and i take that point on board again i have not taken the minister up on his offer of a meeting and i have no intention of doing so the hmrc\u2019s proposal for closing down the exemption on which the treasury consulted involved instances in which there was no regular or substantial trading of the bonds in question we all accept that there is limited liquidity for many legitimate eurobond issues so such a criterion would be difficult to put into operation however we propose to explore the possibility of removing the exemption when bonds are issued to connected persons we are making a substantially different offer with the aim of closing aloophole that everyone knows is being abused and on which the government have failed to act i should be happy to meet the minister and talk to him about how we propose to close down the eurobond exemption i do not have access to the same officials as he does but i do have another way of closing down that exemption ", "i will not because i am going to make some more progress thirdly we have said that we will prevent hedge funds that are avoiding stamp duty on shares from being able to do so hedge funds currently avoid stamp duty by not buying the shares directly instead they get intermediaries to buy them on their behalf those intermediaries are investment banks which benefit from tax relief on stamp duty the hedge funds then enter into a contract for difference with the banks which means that they benefit from changes in the share prices without holding the shares directly that is an exploitation of intermediaries\u2019 relief by hedge funds we have had a great deal of discussion about hedge funds in the past few days i note in particular that during prime minister\u2019s question time today the prime minister did not address the point of the relief that is being abused he wanted to get involved in a debate about who had introduced the relief rather than about the fact that it is currently being abused by hedge funds we have said that we will stop the practice but we hear nothing from the government about what they intend to do about an issue of which they too are fully aware fourthly we will take forward proposals that we were developing in government to deem construction workers to be employed for tax purposes if they meet criteria that most people would regard as obvious signs of employment that would reverse the government\u2019s decision to abandon these measures thereby dealing with a major cause of avoidance in the construction sector finally we would scrap the government\u2019s shares-for-rights scheme which allows individuals to trade key employment rights for shares in a company the policy has received widespread criticism writing in the financial times paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies has said that just as concern over tax avoidance is at its highest in living memory just as government ministers are falling over themselves to condemn such behaviour that same government is trumpeting a new tax policy that looks like it will foster a whole new avoidance industry its own fiscal watchdog seems to suggest that the policy could cost a staggering \u00a31 billion a year and that a large portion of that could arise from \u2018tax planning\u2019 labour will scrap the shares-for-rights scheme and redeploy hmrc resources to other areas where they are greatly needed ", "i agree that we need a public form of country-by-country reporting in government we would seek an international agreement if possible on public forms of such reporting at present the agreement arising from the base erosion and profit-shifting process is to make country-by-country reporting available to tax authorities but we believe that there is a strong case for the information to be made public we will seek a multilateral agreement but if that is not possible we will discuss with business in this country the best way to introduce a public country-by-country reporting format on a unilateral basis as i have said we will take further action to stop umbrella companies from exploiting tax relief and to force the united kingdom\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies to produce publicly available registers of beneficial ownership [interruption ] the minister again chunters from a sedentary position i note that there was no chuntering from him when it came to his record and the decisions that he made about stephen green but he has suddenly come back to life he says from a sedentary position  how i say to him that the prime minister himself said this was a vitally important policy which was desperately needed in order to open up the secrecy associated with the overseas territories and the crown dependencies the prime minister has been writing increasingly shirty letters to the crown dependencies and overseas territories saying that they need to move forward with a publicly available register of beneficial ownership and nothing has happened actually since my right hon friend the leader of the opposition made his announcement at the weekend that we would seek a blacklisting of overseas territories and crown dependencies if there was no movement on a public register of beneficial ownership within six months of the next labour government today gibraltar for example has said it will take very seriously our call for a public register i think that turning up the heat on this issue and being serious about action can gain a lot more than the government\u2019s approach thus far as i said in response to the intervention by the hon member for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) we will make country-by-country reporting information publicly available we will tackle the use of dormant companies to avoid tax by requiring them to report more frequently and we will ensure stronger independent scrutiny of the tax system including reliefs and the government\u2019s efforts to tackle tax avoidance the problem of tax avoidance and tax evasion is not new for as long as the state has been levying tax people have tried to avoid it a fact that rightly and understandably is resented by those who do pay what they owe members on the government benches have failed to understand that those levels of resentment frustration and mistrust have risen to critical levels this is a problem that requires a new level of determination to fix the problem corrodes the central tenet of the contract between the government and their people it is simply not okay to have one set of rules for those who have enough money to require a swiss bank account and another set for those who do not one set of rules for those with armies of accountants and another set for those who do not and one set of rules for those who are well connected and another for those who are not the government have failed to rise to the enormity ofthe challenge the motion i speak in favour of this evening shows how the next labour government will do so ", "(urgent question) to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will make a statement on tax avoidance and evasion by hsbc ", "the financial secretary\u2019s remarks simply do not go far enough we need much more detail from him as to what the government have been up to since they were made aware of this information and why they have apparently failed to act over such serious allegations first when the french authorities passed this information to hmrc who saw it and what was done with it were ministers informed and what communications did hmrc have with the treasury and no 10 if there was no communication why not given the seriousness of the issue secondly what information did the government seek from lord green about the allegations of malpractice at hsbc and his involvement in them prior to his appointment as a trade minister the financial secretary said this morning that the information was in the public domain before 2010 what information was sought and received any failure by this government to question stephen green before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility and the government must address that point does the financial secretary agree that the minimum to be expected now must be an immediate statement by lord green with a full explanation of his role in these allegations while at hsbc his knowledge of them while he was a government minister and all communication he has had on these issues with government ministers thirdly at any point during lord green\u2019s stint in government did the financial secretary or any other member of the government discuss allegations of tax avoidance and evasion at hsbc with lord green in 2011 hmrc was open about conducting investigations into the uk individuals on the so-called falciani list can the financial secretary give a categorical statement about what discussions have been had between may 2010 and now between hmrc and members of the government about such investigations this government have failed to back labour in our calls to crack down on tax avoidance whether on stopping hedge funds avoiding hundreds of millions [interruption ]", "thank you mr deputy speaker this government have failed to back labour in our calls to crack down on tax avoidance whether on stopping hedge funds avoiding hundreds of millions in tax on shares or on closing the eurobonds loophole and now it seems that wrongdoing may have been overlooked on their watch as richard brooks a former hmrc tax inspector has said the treasury and hmrc knew that there was a mass of evidence of tax evasion at the heart of hsbc in 2011 but they simply washed their hands of it ", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of the clause and the amendment i will be brief everything he said highlights again that the onus is back on the political process that must now be undergone for the northern ireland executive to show that they have put their finances on a sustainable footing in the clause 1 stand part debate i asked whether there was potential for the minister until this bill completes all its stages in this house and the other place to give an indication of the timetable we might be working to over the next year or year and a half or so i did not catch an answer to it in his previous remarks will he return to that point ", " further to that point of order mrs osborne i associate myself with the minister\u2019s remarks particularly his thanks to you and sir david amess i thought that his 60 second estimate was rather generous the time we spent in the programming sub-committee was considerably shorter but that was entirely down to sir david\u2019s excellent chairmanship long may it continue i too thank the officials from the treasury hmrc and the northern ireland office as well as the clerks \u00a0the doorkeepers the police hansard the whips for keeping us all in line so very well and members from across the house although the debate has not taken up all the sittings allocated it has been detailed and we have had high-quality contributions from members from across the house that is a sign of how important some of these issues are to not only members with a direct interest but all of us who want both northern ireland and uk plc to succeed i also thank the minister he is right so much for a zombie parliament he and i alone are keeping the legislative flame alive in this parliament i see more of him than i do many of the rest of my colleagues i look forward to discussing the bill further as it continues its passage through the house ", " i was rather surprised that the minister did not go on a bit longer i hope he will forgive me some detailed questions about clause 1 and in particular the 17 chapters of new part 8b of the corporation tax act 2010 that it introduces the committee will be pleased to know that i do not intend to go individually through each of the chapters as the financial secretary explained clause 1 and enables the northern ireland assembly to set the main rate of corporation tax in respect of certain trading profits to be called the northern ireland rate the rate in general will apply to all of the trading profits of a company if that company is a micro small or medium-sized enterprise and the company\u2019s employees\u2019 time and costs fall largely in northern ireland the rate will also apply to trading profits attributable to certain operations of large companies using the usual internationally recognised principles of attribution and to an appropriate share of a corporate partner\u2019s share of the profits of a partnership we are committed as i believe are hon members across the house to supporting measures that would increase inward investment in northern ireland and support the much-needed rebalancing of northern ireland\u2019s economy for decades northern ireland has lagged behind the rest of the uk in terms of productivity and prosperity various measures have been tried to boost the northern ireland economy including increased levels of investment and job-creation programmes but few have had long-term success in contrast for many years \u00a0the republic of ireland has had a low corporation tax rate of 12 5% specifically designed to attract direct foreign investment stimulate internal investment and therefore stimulate the whole economy as we have discussed it has long been argued that a similar or lower rate would have similar benefits for the northern ireland economy the need for such a change is more pressing given the land border between the two countries the starting point is to acknowledge that the case for devolution of corporation tax to northern ireland is unique compared with the rest of the uk northern ireland has underperformed economically the financial secretary mentioned the impact of 30 years of the troubles which deterred inward investment and prompted many highly skilled workers to leave northern ireland and seek employment elsewhere as i said the sharing of the land border with the republic of ireland is what makes the case for northern ireland and for this change different from arguments that may be made by other parties elsewhere ", " i can see where the financial secretary is trying to take the debate so let me tackle the underlying political point head on of course it is the case that the headline rate of corporation tax has an impact on the matters he raises but he will know i am sure that the businesses that tell me this tell him too that the headline rate of corporation tax is not the only factor that companies consider when deciding in which country to locate it is one of a range of factors i will make that point in relation to the changes envisaged for northern ireland that is an important aspect of the policy-making framework it does have an impact on the decisions companies make about the relocation of their businesses but it is not the only factor and it would be a mistake to think that that alone it is a magic bullet either for the uk as a whole or northern ireland in particular if the financial secretary is referring to our manifesto commitment for an increase in the headline rate of corporation tax from 20% to 21% he will know because i have told him on many occasions that we are making that change in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to business rates all the money raised from the change will be spent on cutting and freezing business rates business rates policy is also an important aspect of the cost of doing business i am sure that he would agree though we may differ on the things that should happen to alleviate the pressure of business rates i return to the specific challenges faced by northern ireland as i said there are unique reasons why this change makes sense for northern ireland and not for other parts of the united kingdom i am thinking in particular of the arguments made by the snp in relation to scotland which we heard a little about on second reading however it would be a mistake to think that changes to corporation tax rates alone will succeed in turning the \u00a0northern ireland economy around it can certainly provide a huge boost to the efforts needed to achieve that but i fear that it may not succeed on its own there are a number of other drivers of economic growth in particular labour costs skills availability and infrastructure are incredibly important when looking at why the republic has been so successful many commentators would say that the broader policy framework is just as important as the very low rate of corporation tax many members have already alluded to the importance of other policy drivers in achieving the economic growth in northern ireland that we all want to see however we did not hear much from either the secretary of state or the financial secretary about the government\u2019s view on what further policy changes might be needed i hope that i can persuade the financial secretary to say what he thinks the rest of northern ireland\u2019s policy environment will need to look like for the full benefits of this change to be felt by its people in addition to discussions about the headline rate and what must be done to achieve its devolution are there any discussions going on now between the treasury and the northern ireland executive about the rest of the policy framework the financial secretary may well say that some of those matters are already wholly or partly devolved to the northern ireland assembly but when considering a move that might have a negative impact on other parts of the uk i would think that the uk government would have at least given some thought to what else should be done within northern ireland to ensure that the measure is successful for both the people there and the uk as a whole i would welcome his comments on that has the treasury made an official assessment of other policy changes needed to make this measure the success we all want it to be the financial secretary will be aware that the republic of ireland\u2019s economy has had some well-publicised problems in the past few years despite its low corporation tax rate this measure is partly about enabling northern ireland to compete better with the republic when it comes to investment how confident is he that the measure will provide the anticipated stimulus to northern ireland\u2019s economy particularly given what has been happening to the economy in the republic of ireland the financial secretary is right that we have already had a fair bit of discussion about issues in relation to the azores judgment the block grant and the formula but he will not be surprised to hear that i want to press him further on those as he confirmed in his opening remarks this afternoon the block grant reduction is currently estimated to be in the region of \u00a3325 million that is a significant element of northern ireland\u2019s budget and will require some significant changes i suspect that the members from northern ireland have a better idea than me of what that will mean for people and communities on the ground but i imagine that the impact will be significant the issue of how the formula is calculated and how it will work will therefore be incredibly important i take on board the financial secretary\u2019s point that these matters still have to be nailed down they are subject to further discussion and i hope large areas of agreement between the northern ireland executive and the government although it would only be fair to point out that they might be an issue of some contention and a stumbling block to progress i listened to what the minister said about the azores judgment and how it does not set out any formula that should be applied in the oral evidence session he also said that there is no element of standardisation because each formula would have to be worked out on the basis of individual fiscal constraints within different countries post-azores however are there any other constraints in eu law or arising from other judgments that might help give us an idea of the parameters in which the formula will operate or is everything left to the rather more broad-brush comments in the azores judgment what discussions has the minister had with the european commission about the devolution of corporation tax to northern ireland are discussions already under way to mitigate the potential risk of legal challenge it would be helpful to know that we touched on this in questions when looking at when the reduction to the block grant will happen the minister said that both things would have to happen because of cash flow at  broadly the same time those were the words he used when i asked him a question in the oral evidence session i want to press him on whether realistically there are therefore any eu state aid constraints to that part of the measure again this comes back to the formula but for the treasury to make an assessment of behavioural changes in connection with corporation tax is not something new to it we have often discussed behavioural change is standard methodology used by the treasury when it looks at the behavioural changes of companies due to changes in taxation laws whether nationally or under international taxation rules will that form the basis of discussions with the northern ireland executive on nailing down the formula because the behavioural changes bit will probably be the most difficult to nail down it would be helpful to know whether there is a standard methodology and if so what it is much of the debate on tax avoidance and the scope for profit shifting took place earlier in connection with the amendments tabled by the hon member for amber valley but i want to pick up on the point about the pressure on the northern ireland executive to ensure that profit shifting is not occurring it is in no one\u2019s interest to see the rest of the uk lose business to northern ireland because of profit shifting it is not in northern ireland\u2019s interests either as the financial burden will fall on the northern ireland executive because they will have to pay back more money and suffer greater losses to the block grant we cannot yet envisage policy measures to head off potential profit shifting apart from the standard areas of risk because companies might come up with ingenious things that we have not yet thought about or been able to turn our minds to who will have policy responsibility for coming up with regulations or other legal changes to head off future types of profit shifting in oral evidence the minister\u2019s official mike williams made a good point about the joint role of hmrc in the risk assessment of possible profit shifting and tax avoidance hmrc is sitting on both sides of the fence so it will see early what is going on and we hope it will be able to take remedial action to eliminate such activities nevertheless might that joint role cause a problem when it comes to policy responsibility on profit shifting i am sure that as soon as the northern ireland executive clock that profit shifting is occurring and is damaging to them they will have to pay back more money to the treasury they will want to take action quickly will a hmrc team be working specifically with the northern ireland executive on these issues will there be a named contact and a named official working together to look at this policy area is there potential for a conflict of interest if there is a disagreement between the northern ireland executive and the treasury about the extent of behavioural change and what is counted as profit shifting where does the resolution of that conflict lie and would hmrc\u2019s role be somewhat constrained in a potential conflict given that it sits on both sides of the fence as mike williams said it would be helpful if the minister could give some indication of what might happen in a scenario such as that we learned from the oral evidence session that the resourcing cost of the measures particularly that relating to profit shifting and other avoidance activity will be paid for by the northern ireland executive i do not believe that we have heard any numbers on what that cost might be forgive me if i have missed something but it would be helpful if the minister could tell us the projected costs on the broader issue of tax avoidance and the uk\u2019s role on the international stage the minister has already discussed the base erosion and profit shifting or beps process in previous debates on the bill that process is incredibly important and we support the government\u2019s work on the matter some in the international tax justice community might unfairly refer to the measure as an onshore tax haven we would all dispute that it would be an unfair and incorrect characterisation of what is happening the minister will know better than me because he is closer to the discussions that perception is important in the world of international tax fairness especially bearing in mind the oecd processes particularly beps it would be helpful to hear some detail about the reaction of our international partners and whether concerns have been expressed and dealt with what is the minister\u2019s most recent assessment of the extent of tax-motivated incorporation in the last figures that i saw hmrc estimated that the cost would be \u00a310 million in year one \u00a325 million in year two \u00a335 million in year three \u00a345 million in year four and \u00a350 million in year five is there any more recent assessment of that we have already discussed conditionality but i do not feel that we have received a detailed answer i do not think that the minister will go further than what he said when i pressed him previously but i raise the matter again because it will be a significant issue for the northern ireland executive if ultimately they are to receive the powers in april 2017 alongside the calculation of the formula for the repayment of moneys from the block grant it is a potential area of dispute that could have the power to derail the process the condition that the northern ireland executive have to get their finances on to a stable footing is a significant hurdle for them to clear but that has not really made it into the coverage of the change as the hon member for east antrim mentioned previously the devolution of these powers is by no means a done deal there is a significant amount of work still to do i was less surprised that the conditionality criteria that must be met have not yet been finalised between the \u00a0government and the northern ireland executive i was more surprised that we do not yet have a timetable for the staging posts of the discussions leading to the decisions on what the criteria will be can the minister tell us today or at least by the time the bill completes all its stages in both this house and the other place whether the government can give an indication of some timetabling over the next year or two so that for example we know when the decision about the formula will be made and when the decision about the criteria to meet the condition around sustainable finances will be made then at least the northern ireland executive will know what timetable they need to work to in order to jump through the hoops that are still to be decided on at least the timetable would give us some idea of what we need to consider moving forward i turn to some of the detail of the clause there is a point that i raised with the minister in the oral evidence session some of the tax commentators and tax professionals that he and i are very familiar with are concerned about the complexity of the legislation this bill is both very straightforward and quite complex it is short and clause 1 contains most of the measures nevertheless the bill runs to 90 pages and contains cross-references both to other provisions within the bill and to external provisions in other statutory measures and even an eu definition the bill has 20 algebraic formulae and in its final three pages a listing of more than 50 defined expressions for people in the tax community such as accountants lawyers and other professionals i suppose it is usually the case that there are long-running technical consultations wherein they can raise points that only they rather than mps in bill committees are in a position to spot that is not necessarily the process that has occurred with this bill the minister has helpfully said that he will keep an open mind as to whether further changes of clarification and so on might be needed in future bills however will he consider the case for a fuller and lengthier technical consultation to make sure that there are not straightforward things in the bill that with a bit more time the professionals would have been able to examine which could have eased some of these potential issues finally i will touch on chapters 4 and 5 of the new part 8 of the corporation tax act 2010 because of the amendment tabled by the hon member for amber valley we have had already had some discussion about the opting-in capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises into the large business rules and how there is in theory the potential for smes not to be well served by the inability to opt in to those rules the chartered institute of taxation has raised a couple of more practical issues for smes that particularly relate to the sme work force test it notes for example that for flexible geography businesses such as construction there might be practical issues because quite a few northern ireland construction companies are based in northern ireland but tender for work throughout the uk and indeed beyond and they send people wherever the work is they employ people with different employment statuses the minister and i have discussed the employment status of various people in the construction sector several times and it is not always a straightforward \u00a0matter the government have legislated to take account of some of the ways in which those statuses are used to avoid tax what consideration has he given to this problem in the construction sector to the definition of employment and to the impact of different types of employment status when it comes to the question of who should ultimately be included in the work force for an sme to meet the test set out in chapter 4 the ciot also states that for relevant smaller businesses there will need to be a measure of whether at least 75% of the business\u2019s staff time and costs relate to work in northern ireland that will inevitably add to the compliance burden on businesses obviously for small businesses that can be a particular problem can the financial secretary tell us what assessment has been made of that burden on small businesses are there things that hmrc can do from a more educational perspective to help small businesses with their approach in dealing with companies that have acted in good faith but may find themselves falling foul of the rules i am grateful to the financial secretary for his clarification of excluded trades and back-office functions taking into account what he has said and what mr williams said in oral evidence my understanding is that he and his officials will keep an open mind about whether more definition is needed in legislation perhaps the first preference would be to consider slightly more detailed guidance from hmrc a yes or a no answer would be helpful on that final point ", " i have just a short additional question following the speech from hon member for foyle i bow to his much greater knowledge of the detail and historical development of regulation of credit unions in northern ireland it would be helpful if the minister explained the treatment of credit unions in relation to financial services and with respect to other regulation in the rest of the uk particularly in england is it normal practice to carve out exclusions for credit unions from other regulation that impacts on finance and banking given that this is an attempt to do so from the general exclusion already in the legislation ", " i thank the hon member for amber valley for his comments on his amendment he is right to highlight the risk the points that he made about not wanting to open up further avenues for potential tax avoidance were correct the committee and those who have followed the issues closely do not want to see anything other than genuine economic activity resulting from the proposed changes in northern ireland so that its economy can rebalance strengthen and result in more people being able to access higher-paid decent jobs that will be for the betterment of everybody they key question is what behavioural changes will occur among companies if northern ireland chooses to have a rate of corporation tax as low as that of the republic of ireland that issue is perhaps the most important particularly the question of how we quantify those behavioural changes that is why i wanted to probe the minister on how the formula will be calculated and the methodology that will be applied to try to work out how much money the northern ireland executive will have to pay back to the treasury to account for its forgone corporation tax revenues and to account for behavioural impact second-round effects are explicitly ruled out by the stormont house agreement that is well understood but behavioural impact motivated only by the potential low corporation tax rate which is what the hon member for amber valley was seeking to stop with his amendment will be quite important that could potentially be quite a big bill for the northern ireland executive i would like to hear more from the minister on that i appreciate that discussions about the formula may be at an early stage or are not advanced enough for him to give us an idea of what it will look like but that will be an important additional cost that is not yet well understood if there is a lot of profit shifting from the rest of the uk to northern ireland i want to probe the minister on whether he is keeping an open mind about the potential for having targeted anti-avoidance rules which the hon member for amber valley mentioned taars have been attached to pretty \u00a0much every bit of legislation that i have debated since i have been the shadow minister responsible for this brief so it seems strange that something has not been added into this legislation straight away that does not seem to fit the pattern so far taars are a useful catch-all provision which have the benefit of preventing companies particularly well-off businesses that have money to spend on high-quality legal and professional accounting advice from having some of those early conversations did the minister consider that for the bill and is he keeping an open mind that he or a future government of a different political persuasion may wish to return to that in future finance bills before we reach the 2017 deadline we will return to some of those issues later i appreciate what the hon member for amber valley is trying to achieve with his amendment and i am sure that clarification and reassurance from the minister would be welcomed by the whole committee ", " it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mrs osborne i welcome members to the committee we have already had a high-quality second reading debate and oral evidence session i look forward to that continuing today the hon member for amber valley always brings a huge amount of technical expertise to these debates which is welcome and appreciated he gave a good summary of what he is trying to achieve the financial secretary will remember that i asked him a similar question when we took oral evidence and i was persuaded by his answer he explained that he and his officials had \u00a0considered this point but that they felt in the end that it was perhaps more theoretical they felt that it would not lead to practical difficulty of the kind envisaged in the amendment and the written evidence submitted by kpmg the financial secretary said in his answer to my question that he did not feel that many businesses close to the boundary would benefit from opting in to the large business rules given that he and his officials have looked at this it would be helpful to understand how many businesses we might be talking about and the nature of those businesses i was persuaded that this point is perhaps more theoretical than practical but will he give a bit more information about the number of businesses that would be helpful ", "i am grateful to the minister for introducing lords amendment 1 which was the main amendment made in the other place as he said it enacts the announcement made in the autumn statement that employer national insurance contributions for apprentices aged under 25 will be abolished from april 2016 the opposition support the measure there is agreement on both sides of the house and across party political boundaries that we need more apprenticeships and that youth unemployment and long-term youth unemployment remain a problem not only for the individuals involved but for the economy as a whole we hope the measure helps to alleviate that somewhat the minister said that there is a regulation-making power within the measure for the definition of  apprentice and referenced the 2009 act definition which relates to an apprenticeship contract that concern was raised in the other place when the measure was debated will he give the house more information about progress in discussions with the devolved legislatures about the definition to be applied how confident is he that the provision will not be manipulated in a way that enables a reduction by companies of their tax liabilities the lack of a definition of  apprentice causes concern that that might arise the current quality of apprenticeships has come under scrutiny in this parliament a recent report from the department for business innovation and skills showed that 15% of apprentices are paid below the national minimum wage and that 28% of level 2 andlevel 3 apprentices who do not have a written contract are paid below the national minimum wage we also know that one in five apprentices receive no formal training will the minister consider a stipulation on quality when he looks at the definition of apprentice that would go some way to alleviating some of the concerns raised about potential gaps in the measure that could lead to abuse or to a proliferation of apprenticeships that are not of a high quality and that do not add too much to the future prospects of the young people engaged in them it would be helpful to hear the minister\u2019s further comments on those points ", " i welcome all the witnesses and thank them for coming to give evidence to the committee may i start by asking about the conditionality element of corporation tax devolution in the agreement that has been reached we had a lot of discussion on second reading particularly on the condition that the power will be devolved in 2017 if the finances of northern ireland are placed on a sustainable footing will the secretary of state give us a bit more insight into that aspect of the devolution conditions in terms of the expectations of the treasury the northern ireland office and the northern ireland executive ", " do you have a timetable in mind for the agreement on the criteria that are going to be applied ", " i am a little surprised that the criteria are not in place for measuring a key condition for devolving an important power the northern ireland executive do not yet know what threshold they will have to meet in order to get this power in 2017 it seems strange that not even the basic criteria have been agreed ahead of the legislation is there a particular reason for that is it just timing ", " to move on to the expected cost of the reduction how much money will have to be paid back to the uk a figure of \u00a3300 million was discussed on second reading is that based on a uk main rate of 20% corporation tax or 21% ", " as a rough and ready estimate one of your officials could help if the main rate was 21% what would be the expected cost do we know ", " fair enough ", " someone else can try the mental maths perhaps is there a standard formula for calculating how much money will have to be paid back by the northern ireland executive to meet eu judgments and so on is it what happens in other eu countries when a calculation is made of what needs to be paid back ", " so it is still a matter for live discussion whether the \u00a3300 million or \u00a3325 million cost gets taken off the block grant to begin with or that is in effect done when ct revenues are in northern ireland are the practical ways in which the money finds its way back into the treasury still being discussed ", " there is an invitation to the officials there ", " that is helpful finally before other committee members come in the block grant will be adjusted to reflect corporation tax forgone by the uk government due to direct and behavioural effects but it does not take account of second-round effects on other taxes the direct effect is more obvious but could you say more about the methodology for working out behavioural impacts even though it will not take account of second-round effects on other taxation in the uk and give some idea of the quantum of such second-round effects ", " may i go back to the question about allowances and credits and the fact that they are not part of the devolution measures i agree with the financial secretary\u2019s points about complexity and the increased risk of profit shifting how does the uk\u2019s allowances regime compare with that of the republic of ireland is there perhaps a future scenario where the northern ireland executive might be pushing for devolution of allowances so that they can better compete with the \u00a0republic of ireland which may have a more favourable regime is that something that you have considered and does our regime currently compete quite well with the republic notwithstanding the difference in the headline rate of corporation tax ", " do you agree that the current regime in particular for allowances is competitive when compared with the republic of ireland\u2019s regime notwithstanding anything that might be in the offing in relation to beps and so on ", " you have pre-empted my question on the  double irish you have probably seen the written evidence that kpmg belfast submitted i wanted to pick up a point about the definition of back-office functions the bill excludes trades consisting of lending activity relevant regulated activity and insurance activity but back-office activity is carved out of that kpmg belfast raises the prospect of definitional difficulties for back-office functions what are your comments on that what is the experience of the definition of back- office activity in other taxation legislation and do you expect the same problems potentially to carry over into the bill ", " that is helpful the financial secretary recently met the chartered institute of taxation to discuss the bill i understand there was discussion about the legislation being complex the lack of time for consultation on its measures and the prospect of its being kept under review given the time before it comes into force it would be helpful to hear the minister\u2019s views on that ", " i have one final point some stakeholders and businesses have raised the scenario of an sme that is close to the

and (e) 2014-15 to date ", "i hesitate madam deputy speaker to stray too far from the terms of the bill but the financial secretary is well aware that our manifesto commitment is to raise the headline rate of corporation tax from 20% to 21% and to put every single penny of that money towards a cut and then a freeze in business rates which will primarily benefit small and medium-sized businesses will he at least acknowledge that that is a business-friendly measure ", "it is a pleasure to wind up this debate on behalf of the opposition we have had an interesting and i think high-quality debate it is an important issue which has been the subject of many discussions over a number of years i am particularly pleased that so many members from across northern ireland contributed and i am pleased too that unlike in more recent outings when the minister and i have been opposite each other on treasury matters this has been a slightly longer and meatier debate not over so quickly it is a reminder of the good old days when this parliament was a little busier that was welcome we heard from the former secretary of state the right hon member for north shropshire (mr paterson) who i thought was right to point out the potentially significant benefits of the bill which we also acknowledge as my hon friend the member for bury south (mr lewis) the shadow secretary of state said in his speech perhaps the former secretary of state did not quite hear thatpart of my hon friend\u2019s remarks we say simply that the devolution of corporation tax will require some difficult choices to be made to fulfil the conditionality envisaged in the stormont house agreement and the azores judgment there is a trade-off we acknowledge that the economic benefits of the change cannot be fully realised without additional changes particularly investment in skills and infrastructure to which i shall return a little later we certainly acknowledge the potentially significant benefits for the people of northern ireland through corporation tax devolution the hon member for east antrim (sammy wilson) was absolutely right to highlight the risk of brass-plating we need to ensure that these measures have a substantive effect and i am sure we will return to those issues in public bill committee the hon member for tewkesbury (mr robertson) the chair of the select committee on northern ireland affairs spoke and his select committee has done a huge amount of work on this agenda i pay tribute to it for that the hon member for foyle (mark durkan) was right to say that the devolution of corporation tax was not a magic bullet and to point out that the successes achieved by the republic of ireland particularly from the mid-1990s onwards had as much to do with higher education funding and investment as with a lower corporation tax rate i was pleased that the hon member for redcar (ian swales) asked about transfer pricing and profit shifting and i echo his questions to the minister i am sure that we will return to them in detail in committee but it would be helpful if the minister could set out some of the government\u2019s early thoughts about ways of ensuring that the bill does not provide more opportunities for the exploitation of transfer-pricing and profit-shifting rules there was much talk of the dependence of the northern ireland economy on the public sector but as the hon member for belfast east (naomi long) rightly observed the private sector in northern ireland is also heavily dependent on public sector contracts that is one of the systemic issues with which we shall need to get to grips if we are to achieve a true rebalancing of northern ireland\u2019s economy the hon member for amber valley (nigel mills) highlighted some technical details to which i hope the minister will return probably in committee rather than today he spoke of the interplay between the behavioural change among businesses responding to what will potentially be a much lower corporation tax rate and other changes that the government envisage particularly in relation to the diverted profits tax the hon members for upper bann (david simpson) and for south down (ms ritchie) made powerful points about the importance of encouraging more young people in northern ireland to stay there because they are the future of northern ireland the hon member for strangford (jim shannon) rounded off the debate very well by pointing out that while businesses are very much in favour of the measure we must ensure that the reform delivers for the whole of northern ireland and that the benefits are shared throughout the population as the shadow secretary of state said peace and stability in northern ireland are inextricably linked with the increased economic and social progress thatnorthern ireland needs there is an interdependence between the economy and the peace process i think that there is consensus in the house that if the peace process is to thrive northern ireland will need more private sector growth and investment as part of a long-term rebalancing of its economy it has long been argued by some that devolution of corporation tax to northern ireland so that it can ultimately set a lower rate in order to compete with the republic given the sharing of a land border would enable northern ireland\u2019s economy to be rebalanced more quickly and would lead to sustained economic growth labour members are committed to supporting measures that increase inward investment in northern ireland and support the rebalancing of its economy and we acknowledge that the devolution of corporation tax could play an important role in the achievement of those objectives however as i said earlier it will require a trade-off between corporation tax reductions and spending cuts it is important for us to give proper consideration to the long-term as well as the short-term implications for northern ireland and for the united kingdom as a whole we agree that the 2017 timetable set out in the stormont house agreement allows time for that consideration and we will not oppose the bill we will co-operate with the government to ensure that it can be scrutinised appropriately and dealt with speedily during the current parliament the bill will devolve the rate-setting power for corporation tax in northern ireland to the northern ireland assembly for trading profits only and subject to a commencement order it will devolve the power to set a corporation tax rate but will not devolve control of the base the northern ireland rate would apply to all the trading profits of a company if that company was a micro small or medium-sized enterprise and if the company\u2019s employee time and costs fell largely in northern ireland in that context  largely is defined as at least 75% in the case of large companies the rate would apply only to profits that are attributable to a northern ireland trading presence the northern ireland assembly will not be able to set the rate for non-trading profits such as income from property ", "i am afraid that on this occasion i must give the hon gentleman a similar answer to that from the secretary of state this legislation is looking at the devolution of this power it is not for me to say to the northern ireland executive or northern ireland politicians of any description what that rate should be once this bill passes and we hit the 2017 timetable that will be a matter for the representatives in northern ireland and nobody else there are a number of issues and they have been touched on by members we all need to consider them deeply as this progresses both through the house and in the further discussions that will take place as a result of the stormont house agreement first as has been said the impact of the azores decision is important the devolution of corporation tax needs to be done in a way that ensures it is not caught by eu rules on state aid in order to meet the third of the three conditions set out in that judgment regarding fiscal autonomy the northern ireland executive would need to bear the full fiscal consequences of changes in tax revenues resulting from a new corporation tax rate so the block grant would be adjusted to reflect the fiscal costs of a reduction in the corporation tax rate that is an important issue and we heard from the hon member for south down about amendments she and her colleagues might want to introduce to address the impact and the modelling behind how some aspects of that would work in practice there will be a trade-off with public spending cuts and some difficult choices will therefore have to be made and it is important that those impacts are fully considered and thought through particularly because as i said earlier even the private sector in northern ireland is highly dependent at this stage on government contracts the \u00a3300 million adjustment that might be required is a burden that may well increase if northern ireland were to have a much lower corporation tax rate which then increased the cost and the offsetting from the block grant the hon member for east antrim asked some questions about the formula that will be imposed in order to calculate the forgone tax by the rest of the uk it would be helpful to have some clarification from the financial secretary when he responds on how that formula will operate in practice i am sure we will address the detail in committee but we would like an outline of his thinking now conditionality is attached to the stormont house agreement the financial annex adds conditionality to the progress of this legislation in order to ensure that any changes are fiscally sustainable stating that there must be a clear commitment to put the executive\u2019s finances on a permanently sustainable footing for the future the secretary of state did not in her opening speech labour too much the issue of putting the executive\u2019s finances on a stable footing for the future there is some detail in the financial annex to the agreement but that is an important condition that has not necessarily been well ventilated in the debate we have had thus far again however i am sure we will return to that issue in committee many members highlighted the fact that the headline rate of corporation tax is not a panacea it does not in and of itself result automatically in economic growth and it was only one of a number of reasons as many commentators and academics have said why the republic of ireland experienced its economic miracle from the mid-\u201990s onwards none of us in this house should see it as a panacea investment in skills in particular is just as important as is investment in infrastructure and as members have said is looking at planning rules all these issues will be crucial it would be a mistake to think that northern ireland\u2019s economy will automatically rebalance just because it has a lower rate of corporation tax a rate more on a par with that in the republic of ireland that alone will not achieve what we all want which is a thriving and growing northern ireland economy other changes will be needed and it would be helpful to hear from the financial secretary the government\u2019s thinking on some of them we have talked a lot about corporation tax not being the only way to achieve economic rebalancing but as the hon member for south down pointed out the institute for fiscal studies said in its 2013 green budget that it is a tax which over time can vary substantially in revenue terms and much more so than total receipts from national income we will need to hear more about how the volatility of corporation tax might impact on the northern ireland economy and particularly about any modelling the treasury has done on its impact on northern ireland\u2019s finances as i have said we recognise that there are potential gains for the people of northern ireland from this measure however we want responsibly to consider and ventilate the risks it also poses which we will carefully scrutinise as we progress we will also carefully consider anti-avoidance measures to ensure that the bill does not simply become an opportunity for businesses to brass-plate and base themselves in northern ireland with no other economic benefits for the people of northern ireland i look forward to the debate in committee ", "i am not surprised that the chief secretary to the treasury does not want to acknowledge the full truth unveiled last week by the institute for fiscal studies\u2019 figures its report shows clearly that tax and benefit changes under this government have left households \u00a31 127 a year worse off on average and that families with children have been hardest hit of all does that not make a complete mockery of the government\u2019s claims that they would be the most family-friendly government ever ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer how many staff of each grade worked in the local compliance team of hm revenue and customs

and customs was in (a) 2010-11 (b) 2011-12 (c) 2012-13 (d) 2013-14 and (e) 2014-15 to date ", "i thank the minister and echo his thanks to members from both sides of the house for the efficient debates we have had on the bill which as he noted has had support from across the house he is right that the slab structure of sdlt was very unpopular it was subject to regular criticism and ministers and shadow ministers have long been lobbied for change the institute for fiscal studies described it as one of the worst designed and most damaging of all taxes so it is good to see some change especially given the huge increase in house prices that led to the burden of stamp duty rising significantly i am grateful to the minister for answering the questions i put to him particularly those on dealing with the differential treatment of commercial and residential property sometimes the way in which the minister says  we keep all taxes under review hints that some change might be in the offing or that no change will happen at all on his watch i could not work out which applied today so at the very least i am sure he has made his officials very happy i welcome the measure notwithstanding the figures on house building that the minister gave at the tail-end of his speech i place on record our continuing concern that the government have not done enough to deal with the biggest housing crisis for a generation we need a much more active approach to housing supply rather than dealing with demand-side issues but those are debates for another day the changes to stamp duty are welcome and we are happy to support them ", "i think that the bill shows that the government have accepted that properties with a very high value are under-taxed the hon gentleman alluded to our proposals for a mansion tax whichwould help to pay for our nhs commitments our measures will not force anyone out of their homes because as we have pointed out a deferment option will be available to basic-rate payers i am afraid that that was a bit of party political scaremongering on the hon gentleman\u2019s part ", "i am delighted that the hon gentleman has given me an opportunity to tell his constituents that their fears are entirely misplaced anyone who publishes literature suggesting that the threshold will lower is doing nothing more than scaremongering as we have made clear the number of high-value properties will not increase because the indexation of the threshold will be in line with the average rise in value for the highest-value properties that means that the number of properties caught by the tax is not expected to increase i am as i say delighted that the hon gentleman has given me an opportunity to reassure people who are currently living in properties that are below the \u00a32 million threshold that they will not be caught by our proposed mansion tax the minister explained that the changes in the bill would not apply to commercial property and i am grateful for his clarification of the government\u2019s thinking however i should like to press him a little further on a couple of matters first one of the reasons why the government were so keen to proceed with stamp duty changes applying to residential property was their anxiety about labour mobility has any thought been given to the impact on business mobility of maintaining the slab structure for commercial property transactions secondly changes will come into effect later this year in scotland where stamp duty is now a devolved matter the scottish government will introduce a land and buildings transaction tax which will apply to both residential and commercial properties have the minister and the treasury considered whether there is a risk that england might be disadvantaged particularly in relation to business mobility does the minister agree that the differential in the treatment of commercial property in scotland and england is not ideal and is the treasury taking account of that aspect of the changes finally i want to raise a point that has been highlighted by the chartered institute of taxation it noted the different treatment given to definitions of residential dwellings and observed that clause 1(3) inserts new subsection 1b if the relevant land consists entirely of residential property and the transaction is not one of a number of linked transactions the amount of tax chargeable is and so on the ciot notes that various amendments to the tax system including the introduction of the annual tax on enveloped dwellings or ated have led to subtly different definitions of  residential property for the purposes of sdlt in schedule 29a to the finance act 2004 there is different treatment for investment-regulated pensionsand potentially for capital gains tax capital gains tax-related ated business investment relief for non-domiciliaries capital allowances and vat the minister and i have had a number of debates when discussing other bills about the different treatment given to particular phrases in employment law as against taxation law there seems to be a nuanced difference in the way residential dwellings will be identified in these different elements of different taxes i am concerned that inconsistencies are creeping in which lead to complexity and create more work for lawyers they will welcome that of course but ordinary taxpayers will not it would be helpful if the minister could give us his comments on those differences in definitions and say whether the government are considering clarifying that ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mrs riordan i thank the minister for his introduction to clause 1 and schedule 1 let me confirm from the outset that we support these measures as we did in the previous two debates on the bill we will do so again today as i say we have already had a couple of debates and it is a small bill so many of the issues have been debated thoroughly before i am grateful to the minister for dealing with some of the questions that arose on second reading i have just a couple of points on which i would like to press him and i will be grateful to hear his response in his summing up first can the minister provide us with an update on hmrc\u2019s handling of the queries that arose when these measures were announced can he confirm the number of queries that hmrc had to deal with clarify the nature of the queries that the public or their advisers raised and confirm whether all outstanding queries have been dealt with secondly let me press the minister a little further on the revenue i put some points to him on second reading about the expectations of revenue but that matter has not been fully covered by the responses we have received the minister knows that these measures are expected to cost \u00a3395 million in 2014-15 rising to \u00a3760 million in 2015-16 research by lonres and dataloft has found that more homes changed hands on the day of the autumn statement than on any other day in the past decade so one in six of all homes sold in london\u2019s most expensive areas in the last three months of the year changed hands on 3 december the research by lonres and dataloft estimates that as a result buyers saved \u00a39 4 million in taxes is that in the order of the behavioural change that was expected as modelled by the treasury in its costings i am sure the minister will repeat that they have been independently certified by the office for budget responsibility i should like to know whether the number of transactions and the cost in exchequer revenue after the announcement of the measures in the autumn statement are along the lines that the government were expecting as the minister knows the office for budget responsibility which applies a rating system to the  certainty of costings has said that it considers the costings to be medium to high risk how confident is he about the numbers and about the extent of the behavioural change that is expected ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr turner i congratulate the hon member for amber valley (nigel mills) on securing the debate and on his speech he raised many points on which i too want to press the minister he was right to say that the issue has not received a huge amount of attention and that there will not be a great deal of parliamentary time for detailed scrutiny of the government\u2019s proposals given where we are in the parliamentary cycle the announcement of the proposals was of course rather trumped by the changes in stamp duty which led the media coverage and debate however there has been a lot of coverage in the specialist taxation media and that has helped to bring out some of the issues raised by the proposed diverted profits tax i am grateful for this opportunity to press the government further on their proposals i will seek answers about technical detail bearing in mind that there is currently a technical consultation which will report on 4 february as well as about practical elements and the government\u2019s emerging thinking about the impact on the oecd beps process all three hon members who spoke mentioned that our general approach is not dissimilar to the government\u2019s and we recognise that there is a significant issue all those who have spoken have referred to the public examples of large companies with significant businesses that are doing very well effectively gaming international tax rules to minimise their tax liabilities in this country that significantly undermines public trust and confidence in the taxation system particularly at a time of economic difficulty and stress it is a real issue and it is legitimate for all political parties to look for practical answers to alleviate such concerns as a general principle economic activity should be taxed where it takes place the question for all politicians to grapple with is finding an effective way to get to that point for the opposition and for the government going by what they have said throughout this parliament the starting point is to try to work with international partners notwithstanding the concerns raised by the hon member for amber valley about whether the us and other jurisdictions would be willing to play ball on co-ordinated international action to deal with gaming of the international tax rules it is the right place to start and that is why we have supported the oecd\u2019s beps process it is the right forum for seeking an international agreement on tax rules the government have of course been much closer than the opposition to that process and we rely on publicly available information about its progress and expert commentary from and conversations with some of the participants from what the government were saying up to the time of the autumn statement we anticipated that their preferred way of proceeding on all the issues that form beps action points would be to await the final reporting in september before thinking how to go further they have of course moved a little more quickly with the diverted profits tax and i like other hon members would like to hear more about how that affects our role in the beps process we agree that a solution is needed and are keen for the issue to be dealt with so we broadly welcome the government\u2019s proposed action we will approach the diverted profits tax proposal in the finance bill in a supportive and constructive spirit because we want a workable solution to reach the statute book but i want to press the minister further particularly about the beps process it would be helpful if she could tell us how those in the process have reacted to the dpt proposals and why the government felt it necessary to take unilateral action at this point notwithstanding what many commentators have said about the looming general election was there a feeling that beps would not produce much of a result in relation to the relevant element of the international tax rules does the decision mean that beps will effectively be a failure is that the kind of world that we are looking at some commentators have as i am sure the minister is aware expressed cynicism about the motive for a unilateral move by the uk and some have even suggested that it will torpedo the whole beps process so that weget nowhere i am interested to understand the conversations that the government have had with people in the oecd and in the tax specialist community about where beps now stands ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for giving me the opportunity to highlight labour policy in this debate a few months ago we published a paper on corporate taxation that included a section on the crown dependencies and overseas territories we have made the commitment that if we win the general election we will require the crown dependencies and overseas territories to publish a public register of beneficial ownership that is the key demand of all in the wider tax justice and fairness community and it would shine a light on the true owners of businesses based in the crown dependencies and overseas territories the government have spoken a great deal about doing something similar but i think it is fair to say without being party political that progress has stalled we have gone further by saying that we will ensure that that process happens i have already taken the conversation forward with ministers and other officials from the crown dependencies and overseas territories ", "of course we will look at particular arrangements but transparency is the starting point the prime minister famously said that sunlight is the best disinfectant there has already been some opposition to our proposals which suggests that there is real gain to be made from a much more transparent system for the crown dependencies and overseas territories that will be our start point but we will continue to look at the other issues mentioned by the hon gentleman while we are on the subject i would be interested to hear from the minister about the government\u2019s approach to tax transparency policy with regard to the diverted profits tax she will know that in its paper on corporate taxation published a few months ago the labour party committed to going a little further on the broader issue of tax transparency and country-by-country reporting of business profits than the government have done so far we will support multilateral action because wethink that that is the right start point but if multilateral agreement is not reached we are prepared to take unilateral action on public tax transparency the government have fully rejected that approach saying that it will create too large a burden on business and that were the uk to take unilateral action on tax transparency and country-by-country reporting it would negatively affect the uk\u2019s tax competitiveness the minister is well aware that both those arguments apply equally to unilateral action on the diverted profits tax will she explain why the government have used those arguments to block potential unilateral action on country-by-country reporting in the form of a public register but are dismissive of the same concerns when they are raised by others regarding unilateral action on the diverted profits tax it is important to understand why the government think that those arguments do not apply because although we may disagree with the criticisms made by business in particular in relation to the diverted profits tax it is important to understand the values and philosophical thinking behind the government\u2019s approach because that will give us an indication of where policy is likely to go i would appreciate the minister\u2019s detailed comments on that other hon members expressed concerns about the potential for legal challenge the minister is aware that there is substantial scope for discretion in the application of the new rules although i was not a tax specialist as a former lawyer whenever i see the word  discretion i know that for lawyers it basically means that there is lots of money to be made a point also made by other hon members what assessment have the government made of the possibility of challenges within both eu law and the terms of the uk\u2019s various double taxation treaties my working assumption was that conversations have already been had particularly in relation to the double taxation treaties nevertheless it would be helpful if the minister could update us and perhaps also give further details on hmrc resourcing particularly for known areas of risk of legal challenge the exchequer impact was also mentioned given that the draft legislation casts a broader net than was anticipated in the lead-up to the autumn statement it is unclear why the revenue associated with the measure is quite so low comparatively speaking for example we know that google and amazon alone generate somewhere in the region of \u00a37 5 billion of uk revenue between them a \u00a3360 million tax boost at a corporation tax rate of 20% would imply taxable profits of \u00a31 8 billion which an aggressive interpretation of the rules could attribute to those two companies alone the projected yield therefore implies some combination of caution and potentially significant ongoing royalty deductions from uk corporation tax behavioural change and the anticipation of legal challenges again it would be helpful if the minister could explain exactly what the government had in mind when modelling the exchequer impact of the changes avoidance is a continuing issue whenever new rules are introduced one of the first things we must all look for is the potential for avoidance opportunities one method for avoiding the rules might be the relocation of businesses where the business model does not require a physical footprint in the uk have the government done any work in consideration of such issues the newrules read much more like a taar targeted anti-avoidance rule in the past year i have had a number of discussions in committee with the minister\u2019s colleague the financial secretary to the treasury the hon member for south west hertfordshire (mr gauke) about the use of targeted anti-avoidance rules to support the tax avoidance measures that the government have introduced and i have wondered whether we might also end up discussing a taar for this particular taar again it would be helpful if the minister could explain where the government are coming from on that has the treasury done any modelling to take account of copycat or so-called retaliatory legislation from other countries could the uk ultimately be a net loser we have some intellectual property-heavy sectors in our country particularly pharmaceuticals and media if other countries introduce similar rules that would affect the uk potentially making us a net loser i am sure that the treasury has done some work on such issues we should know more about them in order to illuminate the debate finally where does the minister think the new measures leave the general anti-abuse rule gaar for which they legislated earlier in this parliament tax lawyers in particular have commented that we are seeing much more complicated new legislation rather than better use of existing legislation including the gaar and potentially transfer pricing rules and other elements of the tax system that people feel are currently not necessarily enforced the combination of those two measures could have dealt with many of the issues that have been raised instead the government have decided to introduce an entirely new tax where do they think that that leaves the wider legislative framework the opposition\u2019s general approach is supportive and we will seek to be constructive as we debate these issues further ahead of the finance bill 2015 ", "to ask mr chancellor

excitement today as he was last week when we first debated the stamp duty changes he is however right not to spoil us with a repeat performance and i was amused to see that we all arrived super-early for this afternoon\u2019s debate i wish to indicate as i did at the outset of last week\u2019s debate that we support these measures and will be supporting the bill on second reading and during its remaining stages the minister mentioned the procedural mechanism adopted to give effect to these changes the government moved a resolution under the provisional collection of taxes act 1968 which was passed lastweek in order to give immediate effect to the stamp duty measures unveiled in the autumn statement we debated that motion the day after the autumn statement and today we move on to the bill\u2019s second reading the government have proceeded with a stand-alone bill rather than await the next finance bill in order to give immediate effect to the stamp duty changes and thereby prevent distortions within the housing market we recognise the importance of that and support the mechanisms adopted to give effect to this measure as the minister said stamp duty has been charged at a single rate on the whole purchase price of a property with different rates for different value bands when a property exceeds the threshold for a higher rate of duty tax is charged at the higher rate on the whole value of the sale this is the so-called  slab basis rather than on the part of the price above the threshold which is the so-called  slice basis the tax has been charged on the slab basis for more than 40 years and the slab basis design has caused much consternation and complaint with regular calls for reform in recent years stamp duty has come under the spotlight much more because of the increasing burden the tax has placed on home buyers especially first-time buyers as a result of the huge increases in house prices between 1997 and 2005 house price inflation averaged more than 10% a year and the proportion of property transactions attracting stamp duty rose from about half to more than three quarters during roughly the same period in order to assist buyers and first-time buyers in particular we have seen a number of measures designed to alleviate some of the burden caused by stamp duty under its previous structure they focused primarily on thresholds and stamp duty holidays the threshold was doubled in 2005 it was temporarily increased by \u00a350 000 for one year in 2008 and it was doubled again for first-time buyers for three years from march 2010 the burden of stamp duty however has continued to be significant increasing by 30% between 2009-10 and 2013-14 the continued growth in the housing market has been the reason for the increasing stamp duty burden in that context today\u2019s reform is sensible and has attracted support from across the house sdlt rates will now only apply to the part of the property\u2019s selling price that falls within each value band and new rates and thresholds have been introduced i have a number of questions on specific elements of the changes and i hope that the exchequer secretary will deal with them when she responds to the debate the changes came in with immediate effect on 4 december the government have explained that those who had exchanged contracts before 4 december but who were completing on or after that date will be able to choose whether the old or the new rules apply will the minister update us on how many people she anticipates will opt for one or other of those options and what impact the changes have had on property transactions in the period immediately following the autumn statement the financial secretary to the treasury made it clear both last week and this afternoon how her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs has been giving advice on the implications of this reform i think he said that the calculator on the government website had been used 500 000 times last week that figure has now gone up to 880 000 he also told us that the hmrc call centre was manned until midnight on 3 december when the changestook effect and that hmrc specialists responded to 250 inquiries by telephone and all but 3% of them were resolved immediately will the minister update us on whether the remaining handful of inquiries have been followed up and on what points were members of the public or their advisers seeking clarification it would be helpful for the house to understand how the public are responding to these changes i also wish to press the minister on the revenue implications of the measures it is estimated that in 2014-15 the reform will cost \u00a3395 million which rises to around \u00a3760 million in 2015-16 that is a significant amount of money at a time when the public finances remain challenging to say the least how certain is the minister that the other measures in the autumn statement which the government say will raise enough revenue to offset the cost of this measure will in fact raise the amounts that they hope today the government have published the draft bill for the new diverted profits tax which they say will raise \u00a31 3 billion over the scorecard period however the office for budget responsibility says that those numbers are uncertain and in its fiscal outlook gives a new rating system to reflect the degrees of uncertainty over some of the figures in the autumn statement for the diverted profits tax and the sdlt numbers for example it gives a medium to high uncertainty rating what impact will that have and how confident is the minister that we will not have future debates on the failure of some of these measures to live up to the government\u2019s claims we have just heard how these changes will apply only to residential properties the institute for fiscal studies and others have queried why the changes have not been extended to cover commercial property too when i raised that point last week the minister said that the government were not persuaded of the case but it does seem odd to be running two different systems for the same tax especially when the government have acknowledged as we all have that the slab structure has a very distorting effect the government say that the slab stamp duty system had a negative impact on labour mobility why do they think that the same will not happen in relation to business mobility perhaps the exchequer secretary can give us some more detail on the government\u2019s thinking in that regard has any assessment been done on the impact of retaining the slab system for commercial property and on how competitive a place this country is in which to do business are there any plans to look at this matter again ahead of the general election last week the minister said that the changes will have a positive effect on labour mobility and productivity but the obr says that the effect will be limited and highly uncertain because while higher rates of stamp duty reduce households\u2019 propensity to move the adverse effect was confined to short-distance and non-job related moves - an impact less likely to have direct implications for gdp why do ministers think slightly differently on the matter of labour mobility as the minister has explained the measures apply to scotland only until april next year as responsibility for this tax was devolved to the scottish government in the scotland act 2012 the scottish government have announced details of their land and buildings transaction tax which also has a slice structure the scottish lbttwill apply to both residential and commercial properties i want to press the minister on what impact that will have on the rest of the uk when it comes to the question of where businesses choose to buy commercial properties is there a risk that england may be disadvantaged the more favourable regime in scotland with the slice structure for commercial property might mean that businesses avoid buying commercial property in england where the less favourable slab structure applies what impact will that differential treatment of commercial property have on business mobility although devolution is an important process as it puts decision making closer to the people whom it affects we all want to avoid unhealthy tax competition among the nations of the uk has any assessment been carried out to consider the implications of such competition of course none of the measures that we are debating today deals with the main cause of the biggest housing crisis for a generation which is the lack of supply last week i asked the minister about how the stamp duty changes will impact on house prices he said that there would be some impact but that house prices are affected by a number of factors i wish to press him and the exchequer secretary on the assumptions that the government have made and what outcome they would like to see when it comes to the interaction between the stamp duty changes and house prices it looks like we are seeing a 1 4% increase in prices against a 1% reduction in stamp duty at the lower end and it seems also that the tax take from stamp duty will rely on a 5% annual increase in property prices the obr says that house prices will continue to rise faster than incomes which will risk pushing home ownership further out of reach for many more people have the government assessed how many more people might be priced out of the property market measures to alleviate the burden on buyers are welcome but we are experiencing the worst housing crisis for a generation and need much more action on housing supply if we are to get our housing market into better shape and help more young people and families to realise their dream of home ownership i note the comments that the financial secretary to the treasury made in his opening speech but the truth is that we need to build many more homes than this government have managed in their term of office at the moment the government are primarily focusing on the demand side of the housing equation whereas we on the opposition benches think that they should have taken the opportunity to balance things up on the supply side too however the measures before us today are reasonable and sensible we support them and i look forward to further debate in committee ", "will the minister rule out a further cut to the additional rate of income tax for the top 1% of earners will he rule out another tax cut for millionaires ", "i will take that as a no the minister has failed to rule out another tax cut for the richest 1% of earners in our country as he signalled in his answer the prime minister has made \u00a37 billion-worth of unfunded tax promises for the next parliament we did not find out in the autumn statement where the money is coming from to pay for these promises so unless the minister can stand at the dispatch and categorically rule out raising vat again will not people just conclude that the only way the chancellor can pay for his unfunded tax promises is with another tory vat rise ", "with the leave of the house i wish to respond to the minister\u2019s speech i thank him for eventually making it to the chamber to move his motion and introduce the debate just when i thought i had this place sussed out something else happens to remind me of the many different ways of interpreting parliamentary procedure and rules i have learned something new today for which i am grateful as we indicated yesterday once the chancellor had made the autumn statement we will support the measures today and the bill next week i have seen the draft clauses and explanatory notes there are only two clauses and one schedule and we will consider the technical detail ahead of the debate next week but in the meantime i have a few questions for the minister if he cannot answer them today i hope he will give us further details in time to inform our debate next week the reforms to sdlt apply only to residential properties the previous stamp duty system the so-called slab system remains in place for commercial properties beyond mere electioneering what is the government\u2019s reason for focusing the proposals on the residential market as he knows in scotland where the scottish government will take control of stamp duty next april the land and buildings transactions tax will apply to both commercial and residential properties meaning that scotland will have the system for both types of property whereas we will retain two different systems it would be helpful to understand the government\u2019s thinking and any assessments the treasury has done on having two different systems in the context of corporation tax possibly being devolved to northern ireland where different circumstances apply have the government done any modelling on the potential for unhealthy tax competition if we have this differential in the way in which stamp duty operates on commercial property in scotland and england it would be helpful to know how much work the government have done on that point and whether they plan to introduce further proposals what assumptions have the government made regarding house price increases as a result of the stamp duty changes it looks like we are seeing a 1 4% increase in prices against a 1% reduction in stamp duty at the lower end and it seems also that the tax take from stamp duty will rely on a 5% annual increase in property prices have the government assessed whether that might price more people out of the property market as the minister will be aware the obr\u2019s assessment accompanying the autumn statement states that house prices will continue to rise faster than incomes which will risk pushing home ownership further out of reach for many people will he share with us the treasury\u2019s assessment and modelling in relation to the stamp duty changes and the impact on home ownership and prices the last time the minister and i debated stamp duty in a debate introduced by the hon member for st albans (mrs main) in westminster hall it was one of the only debates the house has had on stamp duty in recent times it was a good opportunity for members to raise issues of concern and we discussed at length the difficulties with the system of stamp duty that the government have now changed the slab structure and so-called cliff edges which no doubt created significant price distortions around the thresholds many members from all parties housing specialists and commentators have long complained about the structure of stamp duty the institute for fiscal studies the mirrlees reviews and others all agreed that the tax was badly designed furthermore it has undoubtedly been an increasing burden on buyers from 1997 to 2005 house price inflation averaged more than 10% a year and the proportion of property transactions attracting stamp duty rose from about half to more than three quarters over roughly the same period measures to alleviate the burden focused primarily on thresholds and stamp duty holidays the threshold was doubled in 2005 temporarily increased by \u00a350 000 for one year in 2008 and doubled again for first-time buyers for three years from march 2010 stamp duty has continued to be a significant burden however it has increased by 30% between 2009-10 and 2013-14 we have seen continued growth in the housing market and more people have been brought within the higher tax bracket all of which have increased the burden significantly this is therefore a sensible measure and we will support it measures to alleviate the burden on buyers are welcome but we are experiencing the worst housing crisis for a generation and we need much more action on housing supply if we are to get our housing market into better shape and help more young people and families to realise their dream of home ownership i made this point to the minister in the westminster hall debate as well i am sure the government will say that they are taking action on supply through the measures in the autumn statement and in their national infrastructure plan but most of the announcements made in the flurry of activity over the past couple of days were in fact reannouncements of existing schemes and money and many of the projects are already in the planning system the truth is that this government have presided over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s we are not even building half the homes we need to keep up with demand we also know that home ownership is at its lowest level for 30 years and that in the next few years the average deposit is going to rise to \u00a372 000 a sum that is far beyond the reach of many of our constituents and certainly of my constituents in birmingham ladywood we needed to see much more action from the government yesterday on getting homes built as well as on dealing with the issues on the demand side we have set out our proposals including a policy of getting 200 000 homes a year built by 2020 it would have been good if the government could have taken a similarly ambitious approach to house building in their autumn statement yesterday we also need to deal with the underlying causes of the housing crisis ", "i find it interesting that government members are happy to plead global circumstances to explain their failures in government yet conveniently forget that we had a global financial crisis in 2008 i think the hon and learned gentleman made that point in a slightly petty way ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the government said in their autumn statement that everything was on course if the finances are in such a good state why will they not adopt an ambitious programme of house building until we have action on the supply side we will not be able to get to grips with this lop-sided housing market we need to get more homes built and we also need to deal with the underlying causes of the crisis for example we know that too much land is being held as a speculative investment even though local people need homes and that the trickle of new developments that are being built are snapped up long before people from the area can benefit from them we also know that our country\u2019s capacity to build homes has shrunk drastically fifty years ago the public and private sectors between them built more than 300 000 homes a year now we rely on a small number of volume house builders and as a result we build far fewer homes a number of measures are needed to deal with the underlying causes of the housing crisis and to get the number of homes built that this country needs we have proposed new powers for local authorities as well as a help to build scheme to run alongside the government\u2019s help to buy scheme which we support we particularly want to see an increase in the role of small and medium-sized construction firms because the resulting diversity in the market would help to get more homes built and deal with the underlying causes of the crisis as i have said we need to see supply-side measures in conjunction with the proposals on stamp duty and the help to buy scheme that would help us to get to grips with the crisis and arrive at a position where the dream of home ownership was not so far out of the reach of our constituents across the country i also want to mention our proposal for a tax on high-value properties the so-called mansion tax we believe that that is a necessary measure to get an annual sum of money into our national health service which is in crisis and in desperate need of further stable funding it is interesting that the chancellor has accepted in his stamp duty proposals the principle that very high-value properties in this country are under-taxed earlier in this parliament he introduced the annual tax on envelope dwellings the ated which is described as a kind of mansion tax for high-value properties held by companies in a corporate envelope now the government are characterising the new stamp duty changes as their version of a mansion tax i wonder why as they creep towards an actual mansion tax they will not make that  final leap and simply adopt our proposal thereby guaranteeing an annual sum for our national health service the prime minister is reported to have remarked some time ago that the government could never introduce a mansion tax because the conservative party\u2019s donors would not accept it i wonder whether that is the only thing holding the government back the truth is that they should go further and adopt our proposal there is a difference between what they are doing today and our proposal stamp duty is a transaction tax but our tax on high-value properties would be an annual charge that would provide a stable source of revenue for the national health service one of the government\u2019s regular criticisms of our proposal is that it would hit those who were asset rich but income poor however we have already set out how that could be dealt with through a system of deferral for anyone with an income of less than \u00a342 000 a year in other words a basic rate taxpayer that would be a perfectly sensible and adequate way of helping those people we could then fairly and progressively introduce a tax that would help to get the national health service\u2019s finances back on track ", "thank you mr deputy speaker i would be happy to discuss those technical details with the minister on another occasion when we would not fall out of order i reiterate that we expect our policy to raise the \u00a31 2 billion that according to the chief secretary to the treasury internal treasury modelling has shown it could raise we have seen nothing to change our assessment of those figures as i was saying the nhs is in dire straits there is a crisis in accident and emergency and it is getting harder to see a gp this government have made things worse with their \u00a33 billion top-down reorganisation of the nhs if that money was available at the beginning of this parliament it should have gone into front-line services we therefore need an annual source of revenue to help to deal with those issues and a tax on the highest-value homes the so-called mansion tax will help the next labour government to do that as i said at the outset we believe that the proposed changes to stamp duty represent a sensible measure and they will have our support today and next week when the proposed legislation is formally brought forward ", "i am frankly stunned i am not entirely sure what is meant to happen in the house of commons when a minister is not present however i am sure that the minister would have spoken in favour of the proposals that were introduced in yesterday\u2019s autumn statement ", "thank you mr speaker i am not sure that i can respond to an opening speech that i have not heard [interruption ] well the case has not been made by the government the motion has only been made formally so may i take some guidance from you mr speaker on how best to proceed ", "thank you mr speaker and forgive me for seeking clarification on just one further point i wonder whether it might be more helpful and  conducive to bringing the debate along if i come in later once the minister has been able to present himself in the chamber ", "i would like to think that the minister and i are always vociferous and meticulous in our deliberations on finance and taxation matters and that we have both been efficient in our deliberations on the bill that is because as the minister explained this is a short bill which aims to simplify the administrative process of paying class 2 national insurance contributions for the self-employed it applies measures from this year\u2019s finance bill now the finance act 2014 to nics and introduces a targeted anti-avoidance rule a so-called taar to tackle disguised self-employment made possible through employment intermediaries and offshore employers we have supported the bill throughout its previous stages in the house and will do so today until now as the minister explained payments of class 2 and class 4 nics by the self-employed have had to be made separately when the office of tax simplification looked at these matters in 2012 it proposed bringing class 2 nics within self-assessment and suggested that this change would being administrative benefits to self-employed persons and businesses in july 2013 hmrc published a consultation document in which it noted that the present system places significant burdens on small businesses and that although class 2 nics accounted for less than 0 3% of the \u00a3102 billion or so of nics collected by hmrc in 2012-13 they accounted for more than 40% of national insurance-related telephone calls to hmrc and the resulting processing work the bill therefore changes the liability for class 2 nics so that it arises at the end of the tax year and not weekly as now and moves class 2 nics into self-assessment so that self-employed people can deal with their class 2 nics together with their income tax and class 4 nics we support the aim of making the system easier for self-employed people and reducing the administrative burden caused by the current separate systems for the collection of class 4 and class 2 nics almost one person in six is self-employed so this is a significant issue affecting a large number of people making the system easier to navigate is therefore welcome and of genuine practical benefit for the self-employed a number of specific issues were raised by stakeholder groups regarding eligibility for maternity allowance and the impact of this simplification on people claiming universal credit those are issues that we raised on second reading which the minister dealt with in committee we were also able to take evidence fromexpert witnesses who gave evidence to the committee we had some useful clarification and reassurance from the minister on those points which has dealt with the concerns raised we are grateful for that we noted in committee that communication of these changes to the people affected by them will be very important a point which the minister acknowledged we were concerned particularly about people who might be described as digitally excluded it is of course easier for the government and it is a responsible time and expense-saving mechanism to put lots of advice on the internet but there are groups perhaps especially those who are self-employed and who may ultimately be reliant on universal credit who might be described as digitally excluded and it is important that they can access information about how the changes may impact on them the minister gave assurances to the committee that those matters were in hand we will continue to scrutinise this aspect as the bill progresses and becomes law as the minister explained the bill also extends provisions relating to follower notices accelerated payment notices and measures to tackle high-risk promoters of tax avoidance schemes that were passed in the finance act 2014 in relation to income tax it applies those rules to nics as well as the minister noted we have had extensive debate on these measures primarily during the passage of the finance bill 2014 in committee the minister provided a helpful update on how the measures relating to income tax are bedding in we heard encouraging evidence from expert witnesses that these measures were already having a positive behavioural impact on the way in which individuals approached their taxation affairs and that the measures were preventing people from getting involved in schemes that they might previously have taken a chance on we welcome that we will continue to scrutinise the impact of these measures and in particular the effectiveness of hmrc\u2019s internal governance mechanisms in relation to follower notices these are important changes and they continue to have our support clause 5 introduces a new taar to cover the payment of national insurance contributions which sits alongside the provisions in this year\u2019s finance act aimed at tackling employment intermediaries who falsely label workers as self-employed to reduce their tax liabilities for workers who are falsely badged as self-employed particularly for those who do not know that that is the case which has happened on an alarmingly regular basis the effect is that they are not eligible for many of the benefits available to employed earners such as holiday and sickness pay this year\u2019s finance act amended legislation directly to address the issue in relation to the payment of income tax a worker will now be designated as anemployee if they are under the supervision direction or control of someone else and in that case they must be paid through paye rather than as a self-employed worker that is a change from the previous designation under which a worker is deemed to be an employee if they provide their services personally it was found by hmrc that many intermediaries were able to exploit that test by claiming that there was no obligation for the worker to provide their services personally to get around that a clause was often inserted into a worker\u2019s contract stating that they could send somebody else to do their work even though in reality the employer wanted that specific worker ", "i am grateful for the question if workers are above the threshold which is in place for the paying of national insurance contributions the usual rules apply i am sorry if i confused the hon gentleman i was talking about self-employed people which is a particular case in the context of the bill clause 5 as i said introduces a targeted anti-avoidance rule to prevent a type of abuse that has been occurring through employment intermediaries the role of the taar envisaged in the bill is to prevent the circumventing of the rules so that workers who would be employed earners if it were not for the intermediary arrangements are treated as employed earners that will allow hmrc to consider both the motive for setting up such an arrangement including whether it was set up to avoid nics and what was achieved including whether it resulted in less nics being paid as i said the problem of bogus self-employment is widespread and complex we heard evidence on that particularly in committee where one witness said that there were ways in which companies were trying to avoid paying national insurance contributions the minister helpfully told the committee that he and his officials were already looking into that taking action in this area is difficult if often feels as if the government of the day are playing catch-up with companies intent on trying to find ways of getting around the rules but tackling bogus self-employment is necessary for parties of all political persuasions to protect revenues to the exchequer the minister and i may occasionally disagree on the emphasis and priorities for action in dealing with false self-employment but the taar introduced by clause 5 is a useful addition to the government\u2019s armoury for tackling this type of tax avoidance and we support that measure question put and agreed to bill accordingly read the third time and passed ", "we have had a good debate today with some excellent contributions including those from my hon friendsthe members for stretford and urmston (kate green) for swansea west (geraint davies) for bethnal green and bow (rushanara ali) for inverclyde (mr mckenzie) and for heywood and middleton (liz mcinnes) and my right hon friend the member for holborn and st pancras (frank dobson) we have seen the real divide that exists between opposition members and those on the government benches about the choices that have to be made at a time when the deficit is still high and rising tough times are set to last well into the next parliament we are clear that the difficult choices that have to be made while we get the deficit down must be made fairly but under this government while millions of people have seen their taxes go up millionaires have been given a huge tax cut that tax cut is worth an average of \u00a3100 000 for those earning over \u00a31 million and this at a time when households will be on average \u00a3974 a year worse off as a result of tax and benefit changes made since 2010 at the top end of the income scale people are a hundred grand a year better off but at the other end people are nearly a grand a year worse off what does that \u00a3100 000 look like in the real world in my constituency the median income of the tax-paying self-employed person based on the 2011-12 census figures was \u00a38 410 so a tax break of \u00a3100 000 for the wealthiest is troubling to me that \u00a3100 000 tax break reflects more than 11 years\u2019 worth of work by the self-employed worker of birmingham ladywood to put that another way based on average rents in inner-city birmingham \u00a3100 000 equates to about 15 years\u2019 worth of rent so when we throw these figures around we would do well to remind ourselves what that money means in the real world and to ask ourselves which policy the restoration of the 50p rate or the retention of the status quo most people in my constituency and across the country would find fair this government have totally failed on tax fairness sure they said the words and they said some very strong words with clear and unambiguous meanings the chancellor told the tory party conference in 2012 that his famous line  we\u2019re all in this together was more than a slogan he said that it spoke of our values and of our intent we\u2019re all in this together a sign of tory values and intent who does he think he is kidding that was just six months before the decision to cut the 50p top rate to 45p took effect he can say the words as many times as he likes but it is his actions that he will be judged on and the chancellor\u2019s actions show clearly that we are definitely not all in this together how do the government try to get away with making such an unfair choice well their main argument we heard this today is that the 50p rate did not raise very much money the static costing of the cut to 45p is \u00a33 billion but after behavioural effects are taken into account they say that the cost of the measure falls to \u00a3100 million but the 2012 hmrc report  the exchequer effect of the 50 per cent additional rate of income tax which the government relied on to cut the top rate acknowledges that the scale and value of the behavioural change is highly uncertain the scale of the behavioural change is calculated by doing an assessment of taxable income elasticity and the rate of taxable income elasticity to apply when calculating the scale of behavioural change is ultimately decided by ministers themselves given how desperate they were to get to the pre-determined outcome that the measure raised no money scepticism about the calculation that they relied on is justified the ifs and the obr both say as i have said that the figures are highly uncertain in january this year the ifs said the uncertainty around hmrc\u2019s estimates mean it is also possible that the 50p rate would be somewhat more effective at raising revenue than their initial analysis suggests hmrc made their calculations at great speed on the basis of one year\u2019s data that had only just become available indeed only around 95% of the data was available at the time they made the calculation by now they have data for 2011-12 too and soon they will have data for 2012-13 as well given this there is certainly a case for hmrc looking again that was the ifs in january this year yet each time we have tabled amendments to finance bills since the 2012 budget asking the government to produce reviews that would effectively carry out that analysis again but with more comprehensive datasets they have refused to accept them why is it possible that they are afraid that further and deeper analysis might remove their central justification for cutting the tax rate in the first place it is not as if the government do not know that the announcement that the 50p top rate of tax would be cut prompted large amounts of income shifting by higher earners the obr has confirmed that money was deferred from the end of 2012-13 to the early part of 2013-14 so that it could be taxed at 45p rather than 50p we know that bonuses in the financial services sector jumped by 76% a staggering sum in april 2013 as bankers waited until the top rate was cut before paying themselves their bonuses the government\u2019s claim that the cut would cost only \u00a3100 million did not take into account the impact of forestalling they recognised that point themselves when they published the 2012 hmrc report it was in the small print beneath one of the graphs and the minister kindly acknowledged it again today in its 2013 forecast evaluation the obr estimated that \u00a31 7 billion of tax was deferred from 2012-13 as a result of the cut and the difference between all that money being taxed at 50p in 2012-13 and at 45p in 2013-14 is between \u00a3150 million and \u00a3200 million the government like to say that top earners are paying more as a result of the cut conveniently ignoring the income shifting that they know and everyone else has confirmed took place what is more baffling is that tax revenue from the 50p rate has been ceded at a time when the chancellor and his team are singularly failing to bring the deficit down at the speed they said they would they said that they would balance the books by the end of this parliament but clearly they will not the deficit is actually rising they said that they would tackle the problem of uncollected tax but the tax gap has grown by \u00a33 billion on their watch we know that people will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 a fact that no minister likes to confirm at the dispatch box furthermore the government have just made \u00a37 billion-worth of uncosted pre-election give-away promises described by the financial times as  neither sober norrealistic the minister today ducked the opportunity to give some specific details about where that \u00a37 billion would be found that is clear evidence that their priorities which have been wrong to date will continue to be wrong if they form the next government it was clearly a mistake to reduce the top rate of income tax it is neither fair at a time when working people are on average \u00a31 600 a year worse off since 2010 nor economically sensible when the deficit remains high and is rising on this government\u2019s watch i urge hon members to vote with us in the lobby today ", "the minister has failed to acknowledge that families struggling to make ends meet expect the government to ensure that everyone pays their fair share and yet the amount of uncollected tax has risen by \u00a33 billion since he came to office is it not the truth that that is both deeply unfair to hard-working families and further evidence that this government have totally failed to tackle tax avoidance ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr hollobone i congratulate the hon member for tiverton and honiton (neil parish) on securing the debate and the hon members who took part in the production of this report i follow on from my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside (mrs ellman) and the hon member for huntingdon (mr djanogly) in welcoming not only the atmosphere of calm in this debate and the transparent way in which it has been conducted so far but the overall tone of the report produced by the appg it feels better to have this type of debate rather than the one we had earlier in the year followed by extensive media reporting which was deeply divisive and caused a great deal of upset and pain to religious communities who felt that their religious freedoms were under attack in an atmosphere of misinformation and sensationalist media reporting which we should all do our best to avoid i am a practising muslim so the issues relating to access to religious slaughter matter to me personally they also matter to many thousands of my constituents who are also muslim i represent a constituency with a large muslim population but i also represent other communities who have spoken to me about issues relating to religious slaughter in particular the sikh community in my constituency who worry that they are inadvertently consuming meat that according to their religious laws they would not be allowed to consume that is why i will focus most of my remarks on the key issue oflabelling which is very important in order to give religious communities people of practising religious faith the opportunity to access meat that is in accordance with religious belief and for those who wish to reject that meat either on grounds of views on the humaneness of the method of slaughter or because of other religious views they should also be protected i just say that i absolutely fully support this country\u2019s current legislative framework which allows religious communities to have access to meat that has not been stunned prior to slaughter i think it is an important protection for religious freedom in our legislative framework and it should be retained if it was not as the hon member for huntingdon said religious communities would be forced to import meat or consider their long-term future in this country and that would be a big and important moment for religious minority communities in our country the report says a great deal about labelling much of which i support as a person of practising religious faith it is important to me that when i am buying meat i am able to know whether that meat is halal and whether it has been stunned prior to slaughter i was a bit troubled by some evidence given to the appg by the halal food authority in particular which was uneasy about labelling because it felt that if people knew that the meat had been stunned prior to slaughter it would lead to a rejection of halal meat that had been stunned i think that is a misunderstanding both of what is happening in our communities today and of the essential rights of consumers to know what they are buying we should not be trying to hoodwink communities into accepting practices that result from mass production and mechanised processes when if people knew about those they would utterly reject and feel very strongly about them i agree with the point made by shechita uk and the association of non-stun abattoirs about the extent of labelling let us say the starting position is the belief that consumers should know what has happened to meat whether it has been slaughtered in accordance with religious principles and about the method of stunning none of those is a particularly pleasant way to treat animals sometimes i think we feel that we can sanitise the whole process of eating meat at the end of the day an animal is being killed and for people of religious faith the killing of an animal is a really big deal which is why so many muslims and jews in particular are so wedded to the methods laid down in their holy books for the killing of an animal a life is being taken and therefore it can only be done in the precise way that god has ordained according to god\u2019s law and that is why that matters so very much when there is mass production and so much meat being produced in a mechanised way it is difficult to stick to the principles laid down in the holy books and some kind of further understanding of what happens in those processes is really important however we cannot take away from the fundamental act that is being done and it is important that consumers understand that more it is not just a nicely packaged pink bit of meat that we buy in the supermarket something happened to it before and the more information that we can give people the more we can shine a light on practices in the industry and actually sometimes shining a light puts pressure on industry to look at better methods that would be more acceptable to the public labelling is something that we should all support but we should not just go for the basic level and we should not just say that the burden on industry would be too great if we gave more information that sounds to me almost as though we are trying to hide from the public what really happens in some abattoirs we should be totally open and transparent and labelling should not just extend to whether the animal is stunned or non-stunned we should look at the method of stunning as well as the method of slaughter and we should seek to educate the public as much as possible that would matter a lot not only to people of religious faith but to people who have no religious faith but want to know how an animal has been treated and ultimately how it died ", "it is a pleasure to close this debate for the opposition there have been only a few back-bench speeches but they have all been insightful and valuable the hon member for reigate (crispin blunt) was spot on when he spoke about a deficit of consumer awareness and said that the fca will have to be alert to the needs of all consumers across the spectrum my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland (tom blenkinsop) sits on the pension schemes public bill committee he spoke at length about the evidence that was given by mr greenwood i am not on that committee but i found the points he made about that evidence telling and concerning i hope that the exchequer secretary will respond to those issues in particular my hon friend highlighted the potential opportunities for tax avoidance i am sure that members across the house will want to interrogate the measures in this bill and the pension schemes bill in detail to ensure that revenues to the exchequer are protected i hope that the exchequer secretary will say more about the government\u2019s view of the number of employers my hon friend gave the figure of 192 from the evidence that was given to the pension schemes public billcommittee who are looking at mechanisms to exploit the changes to the pension taxation rules as a ruse to reduce employer\u2019s national insurance contributions the hon member for amber valley (nigel mills) was right to say that we want to avoid the two extremes that he highlighted he was also right to speak about the importance of getting the guidance to work properly he raised an important point in asking what will be the default setting for people who have been auto-enrolled and have a pot of money but who simply do not engage with the process it is important to get into the nitty-gritty of what will happen in practice in such scenarios again i hope that the exchequer secretary will respond to those issues the hon member for redcar (ian swales) was right to begin his speech by reminding us of previous scandals and the lengths to which unscrupulous individuals have gone and he concentrated our minds on ensuring that such issues do not arise again he was right to say that we must get the guidance right first time because it only happens once for each person that should concentrate the minds of all members on ensuring that we get the guidance absolutely right the shadow financial secretary my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun (cathy jamieson) made it clear that we support the principle of increased flexibility for people in retirement and the reform of the pensions market so that people get a better deal we are therefore not against the principle that people should be allowed to exercise choice however this is a big bill that contains big changes that will affect tens of thousands of people if not more immediately just this week research published by ipsos mori suggested that 200 000 people may choose to take their entire pension in one go next april creating a potential tax windfall for the treasury of \u00a31 6 billion it is fair to say that some issues that are debated in this place appear to be removed from the outside world this is not one of those occasions as the figures show we therefore have a bigger immediate responsibility on this occasion to get the bill absolutely right although i reiterate our support for increased flexibility i do so with a word of caution because that flexibility will be exercised by people who have a deeply variable understanding of the marketplace in which they are operating the ipsos mori poll also showed that only a third of those planning to take out their pension pot were aware of the tax that they would pay should they take out their entire sum in one go the 2012 department for work and pensions attitude to pensions survey noted that half the respondents had no prior knowledge of annuities before being asked the questions in the survey the financial services consumer panel also published a report in december 2013 which said that the market does not work well for the majority of consumers one of its key findings was that consumers were poorly placed to drive effective competition among providers and distributers of annuities it said there are many barriers inhibiting consumers\u2019 full engagement when they decide to annuitise low financial capability fear of product complexity and of making an irreversible high-cost mistake general distrust of professional advisers and inability to find appropriate advice at acceptable cost the bill will operate in that context not in some fantasy world in which the majority of the electorate has anin-depth understanding of the pension marketplace that is not to say that a greater understanding cannot be fostered because as we know the same dwp survey shows an increase in the awareness of annuities between 2012 and the previous survey in 2009 however in some cases we start from a very low base we also have a social responsibility to get this right this policy needs to be fair successive governments have invested in pension relief to support people in retirement as the government have said it is an annual investment of \u00a322 8 billion and it is important that we ensure that the taxpayer gets good value for money for that it is money that belongs to all taxpayers even those for whom a private pension or a workplace pension are out of reach we must ensure that the relief given generates the consequences intended the main one of which is income in retirement not income for other things ", "i was simply making the point that the reliefs are there for a reason and we have to ensure that they work for the benefit of all taxpayers but the hon gentleman is right there is also the hard-nosed political test of making sure it is not the government who are picking up the pieces if this all goes wrong i reiterate our support for increased flexibility but we have to acknowledge that this particular system has built-in risks under the new arrangements a pension pot of \u00a3100 000 could be used to secure an annuity of about \u00a36 500 that added to the state pension would yield the recipient a little over the uk\u2019s national pension income according to hmrc\u2019s 2013 figures of course it could be drawn out in one lump sum to buy the proverbial lamborghini it would probably have to be a second-hand one because they cost closer to \u00a3250 000 than \u00a3100 000 but what would happen then if the recipient in question has not made the necessary contributions to receive the single-tier pension when it comes in will their pension be topped up to the accepted minimum level that is not yet clear this potentially leaves us in a dubious ethical position as well as a financially precarious one our responsibilities to get this right are clear it will affect many people and we have both a social and financial responsibility to make sure that the changes work properly given that those changes are so significant i would have expected extensive consultation by the government before the announcements were made but unfortunately that was not the case as my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun said despite beginning well with work on the single-tier pension and auto-enrolment policies based on evidence consultation and consensus which built on the work of the previous government these reforms have been rushed and somewhat erratic the government did not consult before making the announcements either with consumers or with the industry nor have the govt allowed sufficient time for the changes to be executed despite the enormity of the change and the change of emphasis from the importance of accumulation to the ease of access we are left in a situation in which outside experts are lamenting the lack of time to get this right regarding the need for proper guidance for consumers the abi\u2019s director general said the guidance guarantee is a crucial part of the government\u2019s pension reform and the industry fully supports the government\u2019s intention to provide free impartial guidance to savers on their options as from next april but time is not on our side no one should under-estimate the work that needs to be done to make this a reality which is why the government have some urgent decisions to make we have to ask why the government are in such a hurry to push through reforms when some of the essential underpinning to make them work seems to be missing i have to say i am glad that i will not be in the first tranche of retirees to experience these reforms unlike the hon member for redcar that brings us to the issue of good guidance or lack thereof we know that changes of this magnitude will bring a significant number of new products to the market that is not in itself a bad thing as some products will be better than others that is the nature of the marketplace it is also well recognised that on the whole there is a requirement to ensure that consumers are far better informed i have already outlined the evidence provided by the financial services consumer panel however in addition to extensive consultation we would expect the government to have done significant work on the guidance mechanisms before making the announcement in the budget but unfortunately that was not the case from the start a significant level of confusion has surrounded what the government meant when they said that reforms would be accompanied by  advice it later transpired that it was not  advice that would be provided but rather  guidance that is an important distinction as we have heard since guidance carries none of the same legal protections as advice which is regulated and therefore considerably more expensive to provide when the government have been pushed on the matter i am afraid their language has been far from reassuring to the extent that the measure looks like a mere add-on to the whole pension reform programme in my opinion that suggests a slightly cavalier attitude which may prove to be short-sighted the financial conduct authority\u2019s consultation  retirement reforms and the guidance guarantee stated that to be effective the guidance will need to be tailored providing consumers with sufficient personalised information so that they can understand their options and make confident informed decisions about their retirement choices we appear to be getting something far less useful in evidence to the work and pensions committee in april the pensions minister suggested that guidance will be more general in nature the thing we are talking about is free to the customer there is no charge for it it is what we call \u2018guidance\u2019 rather than independent financial advice so it is not formal detailed or product-specific you can go and buy that if you want to but this is familiarising people with the options they have and some of the concepts even most people do not know what an annuity is there is much that we do not know we do not know the detail of what will be funded the level of levy usedto pay for it what the guidance will be expected to cover or what it is expected to achieve even at the end of the debate we appear to have more questions than answers questions that go to the heart of issues that will be central to ensuring that the programme works we will be picking up on those issues of detail fairness and guidance when the bill reaches committee ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation and skills what steps he is taking and

may i follow up what the minister said by thanking you and mrs brooke for your chairmanship i have to say particularly to my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton that it is not usual for deliberations on a treasury matter to be quite so efficient but i hope that the efficiency of these proceedings encourages her to take part in future ones i also add my thanks to the whips and the other members of the committee particularly those who engaged in the oral evidence session this morning which was genuinely very helpful it showed that evidence sessions have a real role to play in helping members understand the impact of legislation i thank the minister and his team as well as the other witnesses for coming to speak to us the minister was able to answer so many questions that my speeches were much shorter this afternoon than they might otherwise have been i thank the clerk and his team hansard the police and the doorkeepers for looking after us in the usual way with that dr mccrea i thank you too ", " clause 5 will introduce a new targeted anti-avoidance rule to cover the payment of national insurance contributions which sits alongside the provisions in this year\u2019s finance act aimed at tackling the issue of employment intermediaries who falsely label workers as self-employed to reduce their tax liabilities for workers falsely badged as self-employed particularly those who do not know that that is the case the impact is that they are not eligible for many of the benefits available for employed earners such as holiday and sickness pay this year\u2019s finance act amended legislation directly to address the issue in relation to the payment of income tax a worker will now be designated as an employee if they are under the supervision direction or control of someone else and in that case they must be paid through paye rather than as self-employed people that is a change from the previous designation under which a worker was deemed to be an employee if they provided their services personally it was found that many intermediaries could exploit the test by claiming that there was no obligation for the worker to provide their services personally and to get around that a clause was often inserted into a worker\u2019s contract stating that they could send someone else to do their work even though the employee in reality wanted that specific worker the role of the targeted anti-avoidance rule in this bill is to ensure that the new measures cannot be circumvented and that workers who would be employed earners if it were not for the intermediary arrangements are treated as employed earners the targeted anti-avoidance rule the so-called taar will allow hmrc to consider both the motive for setting up such an arrangement including whether it was set up with the motive of avoiding nics and what was achieved including whether it resulted in less nics being paid as such during debates on the finance bill we supported the new measures and the corresponding taar for income tax and we will be supporting this measure in relation to nics today the problem of bogus self-employment is widespread and complex we heard about that complexity in the oral evidence session this morning and it is not least because of the prevalence of the use of offshore intermediaries within the process a government review found that at least 100 000 individuals working in this country were employed through an intermediary company that had no presence residence or place of business within the uk in many cases the employee was unaware that their payroll was located offshore and that tax was avoided on their earnings recent legislative changes now mean that if an offshore intermediary directly supplies a uk-based client with a worker the client is treated as the worker\u2019s employer if a uk-based intermediary is involved they are treated as the worker\u2019s employer onshore employment intermediaries have also been found to be engaged in the labelling of workers as self-employed using contrived contractual terms in their consultation the government noted that the practice started in the construction industry but has now spread to a number of other sectors including driving catering and the security industry intermediaries were successfully avoiding tax by exploiting the test that agency workers should provide their services personally these proposals are designed to prevent that the minister and i have had a number of debates on bogus self-employment we have debated an alternative proposal that might make a difference in this difficult and complex area which focuses on the criteria for workers in the construction industry where there is a particular problem with avoidance and false employment from the evidence given by mr green this morning it is clear that this is a complex area when we take action in one area we only see problems move elsewhere the minister and i have debated the merits or demerits as he may say of taking action sector by sector i take on board his point that actions specific to the construction industry leave other sectors exposed while there is a growing problem in other sectors the construction industry has a particular problem and there is a case for considering specific and targeted action what mr green told the committee this morning was worrying although we support the placing of liability on intermediaries there was a specific problem with employment intermediaries and the government needed to act that has had the impact of shifting avoidance behaviour further down the supply chain the minister and his officials said that they are alive to some of the other ways in which avoidance activity is taking place in other parts of the supply chain will he give further reassurance that those gaps will be closed as they appear taking action in this area is difficult and it often feels that we are simply playing catch-up with some of the rules that is worrying and is an indication of the complexities we are dealing with what thought have the minister and his officials given to the extent to which if at all the general anti-abuse rule will be engaged the thresholds for falling foul of the gaar are quite high that was deliberately done to provide certainty so that people know exactly what they are dealing with that argument has some merit but what assessment has been done of the abusive practices we are seeing with false self-employment do they fall foul of the gaar is that worth pursuing in terms of litigation mr green told us about some of the models being adopted by end users and clients to continue avoiding tax and treating workers as self-employed when that is not the case those sounded like cases where the gaar could be engaged but i do not have the details to make a judgment call on that it would be helpful to hear about any assessment that has been done of the relationship between the gaar and avoidance activity in false self-employment specifically on the taar will the minister provide an update on the guidance that will be provided to ensure that the large numbers of people affected by the changes are aware of their new obligations and absolutely clear about the penalties for non-compliance i note that advance notice of the legislative changes for employment intermediaries and of the required reports and record keeping has been published online but the penalties for non-compliance are less clear the online guidance states you may get a penalty if your reports are late incomplete or incorrect hmrc will publish more information on these penalties soon will the minister reassure us not only that the penalties will be published sooner rather than later but also that \u00a0it will be made much clearer that people will be expected to comply and that action will be taken against those who choose to ignore the new arrangements mr ben-nathan from the chartered institute of taxation made an important point which the minister and i have debated previously about the growing differences in the definitions used in different parts of our legislative framework for who is and who is not employed the tests are different for working out whether someone is employed or self-employed for taxation law and for employment law meaning that it is possible for workers to be treated as employed for tax purposes and self-employed for other purposes that might not have an impact on taxation liabilities but it will have an impact on workers\u2019 rights which they may not be in a position to know that they have been deprived of has the minister held discussions with other departments i imagine that it would be the department for business innovation and skills in relation to employment rights to consider the potential unintended consequences of those different treatments we should stick to the same definitions wherever possible because even though the different areas of law can seem well-defined on paper it is still just one legal system we should not introduce different treatments if they can be avoided finally we had a lengthy discussion about the taar and the views of the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales and chartered institute of taxation which feel that including a taar in the legislation over-complicates things and is  superfluous mr hubbard and mr haskew suggested this morning that having both the gaar and the taar and this particular taar might cause complexity or confusion that enables something to slip through the cracks if the taar and gaar are working as they ought to be there should be no cracks for something to fall through it would be helpful for the minister to explain how he sees the two things sitting alongside each other and whether there is a risk that some of what the icaew and ciot say is true i would not have thought so but it will be helpful to hear from the minister ", " i am grateful to the minister for his introduction to clause 3 and schedule 2 he and i have debated at length the measures relating to follower notices accelerated payment notices and high-risk promoters of avoidance schemes he will know that the opposition have supported the measures that were introduced in the finance act 2014 and continue to be supportive of all these measures and what they seek to do to tackle tax avoidance one of the most controversial aspects in our debates on these issues concerned accelerated payment notices and the whole issue of retrospection as put forward by some of the campaigners on this there was a vocal campaign across social media and many business people were getting in touch with their members of parliament i agreed and continue to agree with the minister that issues of retrospection are not engaged because we are not talking about a new tax liability being created instead the issue is where the tax that is in dispute should sit i agree with the minister that it is entirely right and proper that that should sit with hmrc particularly given the ways in which some people have sought to frustrate the process by using the legislative framework to extend the length of time it takes to deal with these matters holding on to the tax for all that period and denying it to hmrc as hmrc win around 80% of those cases most of it has to be paid over at some point so the measures to speed that up are very welcome they have to be applied to national insurance just as much as to income tax in the evidence session this morning we asked some of the witnesses how they felt the provisions on income tax that have already been made in the finance act are working in practice the experts felt unable to make a judgment yet about how those changes are bedding in they made the point which is important for the committee \u00a0to recognise that the measures are having an effect we welcome that fact and i am sure the minister does as well i was struck by mr hubbard\u2019s statement that they have encouraged people to sort matters out and err on the side of caution they have certainly had the welcome behavioural effect of concentrating minds which will help ensure that the provisions work successfully for income tax and after the bill is passed national insurance somebody i cannot recall whether it was the minister or one of his officials said that 600 notices have been issued since august the acoustics in the room this morning made it difficult to hear what was being said given that a reasonably large number of notices have been issued will the minister say a bit more about how the changes are working in practice will he talk about the internal governance procedures that have been put in place by her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs many of the stakeholders said that the changes give the impression that hmrc will be the judge jury and executioner the internal safeguards introduced in the finance act go some way towards allaying that concern but it would be helpful to hear from the minister how they are working in practice in hmrc and the team responsible for issuing the notices a concern was raised about the fact that the changes may affect the successful disclosure of tax avoidance schemes regimes and that some people might be unwilling to disclose schemes they have used if they fear that an apm may be issued the government are conducting a review and looking at strengthening dotas it would be helpful if the minister updated the committee about those important things another point that the minister and i have debated at length when we have discussed these issues is the resourcing at hmrc this morning we heard more about the counter-avoidance directorate and we were told that 100 or so staff are working on this issue as this change is relatively new it would be helpful if the minister set out how the directorate is getting on and how it is operating what is his assessment of the staffing the work load and the skill sets of its staff members does he think more needs to be done to bring the staff up to a sufficiently high level of seniority so they can make judgment calls about follower notices in particular for which there is an internal review procedure in hmrc finally we heard this morning from mr haskew of the institute of chartered accountants about the potential effect on the ability of tax advisers to access indemnity insurance from their insurers we were given a sense that insurers are tightening up the questions they ask of advisers before offering them insurance i must declare to the committee that in my previous life as an employed barrister i was a specialist in professional indemnity litigation although i have never acted on an accounting negligence case the issue of indemnity insurance is important because it pertains to the wider point of whether there should be more wholesale regulation of tax advisers i get representations from both sides of the argument on a semi-regular basis as i am sure the minister does both now and when he was the shadow spokesman it would be unhelpful for indemnity insurers to act as creators of a de facto regulation regime has the minister had more representations on that issue or given more thought to it there is not much time left in this parliament but regulation comes up regularly it would be helpful to \u00a0hear how the minister thinks those things will change as a result of the behavioural change of both the stakeholders the institutes themselves and their insurers on tax advice and liability for it ", " it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship dr mccrea i welcome all committee members to this afternoon\u2019s deliberations particularly my hon friend the new member for heywood and middleton i hope that she will get a flavour of proceedings on finance matters although the amount of time that we take might not reflect the length of other debates in which the minister and i have been engaged in the past few weeks and months i suspect that this afternoon\u2019s deliberations will be as efficient as those on second reading to that end i am grateful to the minister his officials and all the other witnesses who gave evidence this morning in what was a very useful and helpful oral evidence session that dealt with many of the technical points about the legislation that were raised by various stakeholder groups including the chartered institute of taxation and the low incomes tax reform group they were concerned about some of the effects of the simplification measures we heard \u00a0good clarification on those points i am grateful to the minister for his introduction to clause 1 and schedule 1 along with the government\u2019s amendments for self-employed people the office for national statistics believes there to be about 4 6 million of them the existence of two separate systems for the collection of class 2 and class 4 nics is undoubtedly an administrative burden that they could do without most self-employed people are already juggling a huge number of balls so we welcome proposals that aim to make their business lives easier this is not a new area of debate and the proposed changes we are discussing today follow a change in april 2011 that sought to ease the administrative load by aligning the dates on which payment of class 2 nics is due with the dates for tax under self-assessment moving them to 31 january and 31 july the changes before us build on what has gone before the particular change that we are discussing today was raised by the office of tax simplification in its review of small business taxation in various work in 2011-12 the ots noted the advantages of making the simplification change the foremost of which was that reforming how class 2 nics were assessed and collected would alleviate problems for many self-employed persons who find that they are obliged to apply for a refund of overpaid national insurance at the end of the tax year the ots also found that there could be simplification and cost reductions for hmrc and small businesses in combining the collection process and the self-assessment return hmrc estimates that collecting class 2 nics in that way should cut the administrative burden on businesses by around \u00a319 million a year thereby directly benefiting 4 6 million self-employed people after the legislation was published a number of concerns were raised particularly by taxation stakeholder groups about the maternity allowance and the interplay between the changes and universal credit i am very grateful to the minister for dealing with all the points that were raised on second reading some of which came up this morning in the oral evidence session he provided some helpful clarification on the issues raised including some reassurance that pregnant women will not miss out and that people will not find themselves disadvantaged particularly in relation to universal credit the point that remains outstanding from our discussions this morning relates to how these changes will be communicated both to the wider group of the self-employed who will have to get used to doing things differently it is simpler but they will still have to have the impact of the change communicated to them and to pregnant women and people on very low incomes who will have to think about the impact this will have on universal credit witnesses who gave evidence this morning all pointed out that the rules can seem quite complex and are not well understood by members of the public including sometimes the rules on eligibility for different types of benefits from voluntary contributions under class 2 and class 3 as we heard from mr hubbard it is not immediately obvious what the different voluntary payments entitle people to the minister\u2019s officials helped us out with that but it shows that even the experts struggle to navigate this landscape it would be helpful if the minister would build a bit on some of what we heard this morning in relation to communication ms edwards the dwp official who attended the session this morning provided some information in outline about how these changes will be communicated to those on very low incomes and those on benefits i was a little worried that some of what she referred to related to online communications we know that self-employed people on very low incomes and those on benefits are often digitally excluded online communication is a method of choice in the modern age but it means that those who are excluded might not be able to access the information they need i was not completely convinced that the helpful oral advice that is sometimes necessary will be available rather than just something in writing or on the internet it would be helpful if the minister would set out some further thinking and more practical information about what is going to happen for the people who will be affected in that way similarly i am very grateful for the clarification about the working of the maternity allowance as a result of these changes it would be helpful to hear more detail from the minister on communication to pregnant women there is a wider point about communication to everybody who is going to be affected mr whiting from the office of tax simplification suggested that his dream scenario for communication of these changes would involve at least three separate letters to all self-employed people by hmrc is that something that the minister is planning have letters already been prepared has anything gone out already to tell people that these changes are coming will he take steps to ensure that people understand some of the complexity around voluntary contributions and what they entitle people to as the rules engage a bit more we do not want people to miss out because they fail to understand the impact of the simplification as i say it would be helpful to hear more detail from the minister particularly on communication but he has helped on many technical issues for which i am grateful and we support the simplification measures in the bill ", " clause 2 would provide the power to make consequential incidental or supplementary provision in connection with the provision made in schedule 1 that includes enabling regulations made by statutory instrument under the clause to modify any provision in primary or secondary legislation and to make different provisions for different cases or classes it would be helpful if the minister could set out the type of technical changes envisaged in the clause ", " i thank both witnesses for coming to give us evidence today i should like to start with gillian thank you very much for your very helpful written evidence and the various briefings provided throughout the course of the bill so far i wanted to ask you about the interplay between the changes introduced by the bill and universal credit in particular could you set out your key concerns about the impact of claiming universal credit what do you think is the best way to try to manage that issue given the changes that have been introduced in the bill ", " how many people would benefit from a budget plan of the type you are describing what are the numbers we are talking about ", " i have a question for john the simplification in the bill comes as a result of the work that your team did when you were looking at this did you consider the impact on those with very low incomes particularly around the impact on accessibility to benefits and particularly universal credit is that something that you modelled or thought about when you were putting together the proposals for the change ", " do you have a view about the numbers that we are talking about gillian thought about half a million is that something that you looked at ", " a question for both of you how the changes are communicated to the group of people affected will be really important what do you think good communication would look like in respect of the changes what would you like to see happen to make sure that those affected know what is going on and know what they need to do to organise their affairs ", " thank you mrs brooke i welcome both witnesses to the committee thank you for coming to give evidence to us mr green i want to put some questions to you on the targeted anti-avoidance rule in the bill the government have said that they are introducing the taar because of the speed with which people are coming up with ways of avoiding tax do you think that the taar will be effective what has been the experience so far of the people you represent ", " i am just going to follow that up this is clearly an area where we need to see some action in terms of revenues to the exchequer you said that you think the liability should rest with the end ", " all along the supply chain ", " just to help me understand that example of the civil engineering firm why do you think the taar specifically would be defective ", " we had some discussion of the gaar and the taar in the previous round of evidence if an arrangement is not caught by the taar as envisaged in the bill would an arrangement of the type that mr green described be caught by the gaar which would plug any gaps ", " you mentioned the elective deduction model as one of the key developments since the finance act was passed are there any other significant models of that order ", " thank you mrs brooke and thank you to all the officials for coming to speak to us this morning we have just had a very useful discussion about the targeted anti-avoidance rule starting with clause 5 of the bill i know the minister certainly heard and i hope that the official response will also have heard a discussion with mr green in the previous session about ways that end-users are already manipulating the rules they are adopting different models such as the elective deduction model or the contractual restrictive model and also making use of travel and subsistence rules it would be helpful to know what action hmrc is taking on those areas and whether you are aware of what is happening it would also be helpful to hear your view on the effectiveness of the taar or targeted anti-avoidance rule to deal with this what thought has been given to the possibility of putting liability all through the supply chain as opposed to it sitting only with the intermediary ", " much of the discussion we had on the finance act 2014 and the previous national insurance contributions bill was around offshore intermediaries and the different ways people use those to circumvent the rules however mr green\u2019s point was that people get very smart and start doing things along the supply chain once you point the liability at one place what thought has been given to something that catches everyone if the government have acted on a specific issue with intermediaries but those measures although we support them all only push problems into other areas of the supply chain it might be better to take a broader view and introduce something that catches everyone that would say  we\u2019re on to you you\u2019re not going to be able to get away with circumventing in this way ", " i just want to go back to the issue around accelerated payment notices and the point made by the ciot in its written evidence about hmrc needing a power to be able to repay the nics that might have been found to have been overpaid in connection with an apn the ciot mentioned that there had been correspondence with hmrc which was of the view that such a power is not needed it would be helpful to get clarification and to understand why nothing is needed in the bill ", " ms edwards in the early part of our session this morning we had a discussion about the interplay between universal credit and the simplification in the bill for those on very low incomes who are self-employed what discussions have you had with colleagues in hmrc about the impact on those with very low incomes who will be paying their nics slightly differently as a result of the bill and on their eligibility for benefits as well as universal credit ", " how are you going to make sure that this cohort of people properly understand the rules and know exactly how they are affected the rules can be a bit of a minefield for many people to navigate even without any changes do you know what the size of that cohort is going to be how many people will you have to thoroughly explain this to so that they do not get caught out ", " will you make sure that the communication is oral as well as written will there be help to take claimants through the changes on the phone at a job centre or in some other dwp arena somebody should explain how the rules work a letter may be a bit more difficult for claimants to get their head around ", " i just want to go back to a point raised by mr hubbard i raised it because i was not immediately sure what the answer was myself without going away to check i hope that the minister or one of his team can help us what does the voluntary class 2 contribution entitle you to as opposed to the class 3 for nics do we know ", " so it is just the pension bit that is different ", " thank you both for coming to give evidence i would like to put some questions about clauses 3 and 4 which relate to the provisions for follower notices and accelerated payments and promoters of tax avoidance schemes some of these provisions have already been made in the finance act 2014 so the sister provisions have been in place for a short period how do you both think that they are working so far ", " do you mean in respect of potential professional negligence claims ", " in a way that was not already the case ", " off the back of those questions i want to come on to the gaar and the taar obviously abuse and avoidance are two different things i was just interested mr hubbard that you said you were worried that we may be creating more opportunities for schemes to fall through the cracks but i wondered if the reverse was actually the truth because you have to go quite a long way to fall foul of the gaar which has been one of the criticisms that some people have made of it if you are not caught by the taar in respect of this measure you will still be caught by the gaar is it not the case that one way or the other you will be caught rather than slipping through the cracks ", " i wanted to ask about the icaew\u2019s written evidence to the committee you say a power is needed to give hmrc the legal vires to repay nic that is found to have been overpaid in connection with an accelerated payment notice can you set out why you think that and whether you have had any discussions with hmrc or others about how that has come about ", "to ask mr chancellor of the exchequer how many staff hm revenue and customs (hmrc) has made (a) voluntarily and (b) compulsorily redundant in each of its areas of activity in each year from 2010-11 and how much hmrc has spent on redundancy costs in each such year ", "i am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate today i will support the motion before the house but i do so with deep concern and real worry about the future that is not because i do not want isil to be destroyed i do but because i believe that our history in iraq with the war of 2003 has eroded trust created suspicion about our motives for getting involved and perhaps caused some of the factors that has led us to where we are today without genuine prolonged efforts to achieve a political settlement i have fears about where this may ultimately end i am deeply concerned about the potential scale of civilian deaths that may occur bearing in mind the scale of those that have already occurred and that are occurring even as we speak such decisions are deeply difficult i often feel that we have to choose between the lesser of two evils but a political solution is the only way to ensure that peace can be won and in the end that it can be a lasting peace the starting point for making my decision is that those in isil are fanatics and monsters they are not muslims they have hijacked the name of islam the religion that i as well as tens of thousands of my constituents and hundreds of thousands of british muslims follow and practice and which we all love they have hijacked and dishonoured the name of our religion i am a sunni muslim like the majority of british muslims and like them i abhor and am repulsed by the fact that those in isil describe themselves as true sunni muslims they are not and we reject them utterly ", "my hon friend makes an important point the coming together of the wider community has been welcome and much needed he also makes an important point about the radicalisation of young british muslims we must be alive to the risk that all this action might also create such radicalisation i have to say that the anger and hurt of the wider muslim community both here and abroad is secondary to the pain the death and the destruction that isil has visited on its victims muslim and non-muslim alike the rightful place for those in isil is behind bars or 6-foot under the earth what then should we do in making my decision i have taken into account both the nature of isil which i have already set out and the fact that the action we are being asked to approve is legal such action is at the request of a democratically elected government so the situation is very different in nature from that in 2003 a sovereign state has asked for help that we can provide and we should therefore provide it i do however have concerns the prime minister gave assurances on some of the issues when he opened the debate but we in this house should continue to press the government on such matters my first concern relates to the iraqi government the hon member for penrith and the border (rory stewart) raised important and powerfully made points about the difficulty of the task i am not under any illusions about how difficult it will be but the government must be one for all of iraqi society and one in which they all feel that they have a stake otherwise there will be no future for iraq as it currently exists they will have to consider splitting it up into two or three countries with each group being given its own homeland if they do not want to break up they will have to consider some sort of constitutional settlement involving a form of federation or on the basis of the kind of constitutional debates that we are now having about our future they will have to come to a resolution and we must support them in doing so the iraqi army must demonstrate that it is willing and capable of protecting all iraqis including the sunnis in the south of the country who are under attack from shi\u2019a militias there must be even-handedness if we are to win the wider and harder battle for hearts and minds that has to be won isil is presenting itself as the true protector of sunni muslims in that area and we should tackle that head on so the iraqi army must be able to meet that call if the iraqi army and government can demonstrate that they will protect and include all minorities we can move a long way towards the stability needed both to win the fight before us today and in the end to win the peace i must give a note of caution about some of our coalition partners it is welcome and important that they are all onboard but we cannot be blind to the regional dynamics that exist between the different groupings and we must be alive to the risks that such dynamics pose however a sovereign state has asked for help and i think that we must all answer that call ", "i am very grateful to be able to make a contribution to the debate mr hollobone i congratulate the hon member for bradford east (mr ward) on securing it i shall begin by reflecting on some of the contributions that we have already heard in particular there was the sense that somehow it might be seen as offensive elsewhere that we should be debating this issue in the british parliament the explanation given by other hon members was that we have a duty to stand up for the rights of our constituents i hope that in conjunction with its being our duty to stand up for the views hopes and dreams of our constituents it is also because we have a tradition of speaking about matters of concern in other countries that is the whole point as i understand it of having a foreign policy we often debate in the house issues of concern in other countries we did so yesterday on the floor of the house in relation to events in the middle east we have had debates on israel palestine and the recent fighting in gaza i see nothing wrong and nothing to be ashamed of in the british parliament\u2019s having a debate today about the situation in kashmir on the order paper the debate is entitled  political and humanitarian situation in kashmir there is a political situation in kashmir because that is a territory under dispute and there is a humanitarian situation in kashmir as a result of natural disasters and the territorial dispute so quite apart from the justification that we speak for tens of thousands of british kashmiris we are just doing our job let me make it clear that i am speaking in the debate for those reasons because tens of thousands of my constituents are british kashmiris kashmiri in origin but also because of my own background both my parents were born in a village called bab-e-yaam in the district of mirpur in azad jammu and kashmir all four of my grandparents were born in what was before that time the princely state of jammu and kashmir this debate has personal resonance for me because it relates to my own family roots my own history and my own identity the situation in jammu and kashmir is of grave concern as i have said to many thousands of our constituents across this country and to many people all over the world what happened after partition the blood-soaked birth of modern-day pakistan and india was that a group of people from different backgrounds different religions and cultures saw their homeland ultimately split between two countries that is what has given rise to the current long-standing dispute those of us privileged enough to know either azad jammu and kashmir or jammu and kashmir itself can testify that it is a truly beautiful part of the world it is often described as heaven on earth it has been scarred for too long by this conflict it often does not get much attention in our media but it is very real and very alive for many people the world through the united nations long ago resolved that the people of jammu and kashmir should be able to exercise their own will to determine their own future the inexplicable failure to give effect to that desire for self-determination to those un resolutions is in my view unjust and has undeniably caused great turmoil pain and suffering which we have heard powerful examples of from my hon friend the member forrochdale (simon danczuk) as the case that he highlighted of parveena ahangar shows in indian-administered jammu and kashmir that failure has resulted in an uprising and india\u2019s attempts to suppress that uprising have led to grave human rights violations that is not my personal finding but the finding of the respected organisation amnesty international it produced some time ago a report called  a \u2018lawless law\u2019 which was the subject of our previous house of commons debate about the kashmir dispute it is undeniable that the kashmir valley is heavily militarised and that the violence has taken the lives of tens of thousands of people whether you place those numbers at the lower end at about 40 000 or at the higher end of the estimates at about 100 000 they are even at the lower end mind-boggling they defy comprehension and are a scar on the conscience of all humanity a common complaint that we hear from people in jammu and kashmir relates to the fact that the huge number of security forces operating in that area do so with impunity because of the feared and hated armed forces (special powers) act which prevents the prosecution of troops i cannot imagine what it must be like to live in a place where there is one soldier for every 17 civilians given that that number on its own would far outnumber any known or potential militants i can only conclude that such a large number of soldiers operating in that area will increase the pressure felt by the local civilian population as we heard there are many heartbreaking stories of disappearances particularly of teenagers and thousands of unmarked mass graves were discovered in the northern districts time will unfortunately prevent me from discussing those issues in detail but they remain real human rights violations i believe that those need to be answered if we are to have the open and honest debate that the issue deserves in addition to the human rights violations there is a humanitarian crisis caused by the recent floods and the previous earthquake undeniably the people of the region have suffered greatly on many fronts if we are to give voice to the desire of people in the region to set their own destiny we must accept that some wish to be wholly a part of india some wish to be a part of pakistan some wish the line of control to be the effective border but desire freedom of movement across it and some wish to reunite jammu and kashmir into what it was before partition and make it completely independent whatever one\u2019s personal view it is for the people of the region to decide the course of their own destiny it is not for me even as one whose identity and roots hail from that part of the world to say what their fate should be i am a small heathen brummie which makes me an englishwoman and a brit i have no right to tell the kashmiri people what their future should be but i will always speak up passionately for their right to decide their future for themselves we are seeing that happen in our own country a week from today a people with their own land culture and identity will make a choice about the future course of their own destiny and it is only right for the people of kashmir to be given the same choice for many decades they have lived in expectation of being given that choice that wasthe promise post-partition and it is not unreasonable for them to expect that promise to be kept it is not unreasonable for the diaspora communities who live in britain to want that right to be given to kashmir we have had some discussion about the role of the british government i believe that their role should be that of a critical friend to both pakistan and india we have a moral responsibility to encourage both sides to move towards a resolution of the dispute but we also have a responsibility to speak up for the kashmiri people and to ensure that their voice is heard ", "i would like to clarify that i said that there was growing concern about deaths in police custody i was talking not about the number of deaths that occur but about the over-representation of people with mental health issues and about how trust in the police is being eroded in bme communities ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mrs main i am grateful for that guidance which i also received from the clerks in the table office earlier today i confirm that it is my intention to talk about my constituent\u2019s case but to do so in a way that takes account of the fact that there will be a coroner\u2019s inquest early next year i am grateful to have secured the debate and for the opportunity to highlight the very important issues of concern to my constituents and to one family in particular whose case i have been working on for some months deaths in police custody are an issue of growing concern both in this house and across the country and the matter has been raised several times in the house recently in particular there has been a recent focus on deaths in custody in which the deceased had a mental health illness that was not dealt with properly either by officers or by nhs staff i understand that the home affairs committee is currently looking at that issue and took evidence on it last week however as i said i will focus on the case of my constituent kingsley burrell which raises other issues in relation to deaths in custody that show shocking procedural failures which add to the pain that is suffered by families of the deceased and contribute to an erosion of trust between the community and the police the facts of mr burrell\u2019s death as the independent police complaints commission found are that on 27 march 2011 emergency services were called to a reported firearms incident in ladywood in my constituency they ascertained that the complainant was kingsley burrell and also found that a firearms incident had not occurred mr burrell allegedly displayed symptoms of mental health illness and was therefore detained and sent to the oleaster mental health unit he was later transferred to the mary seacole mental health unit in winson green again in my constituency on 30 march staff at that unit called police and reported an incident after which mr burrell was restrained and taken to a and e where he received treatment but on 31 march he was pronounced dead those mysterious and tragic circumstances are difficult enough for mr burrell\u2019s family to cope with but the aftermath has placed significant stress on the family and the way in which this case and others very similar to it have progressed since the deaths occurred is completely unacceptable it adds to the suffering of these families and i believe has a wider impact on police and community relations kingsley\u2019s mum janet brown told me about some of her experiences in the aftermath of her son\u2019s death she told me that the ipcc investigation into the conduct of the officers took far too long she also told me that it was a year before the ipcc asked dorset police to look into the actions of the nhs staff involved in kingsley\u2019s care both police and nhs staff had had contact with kingsley in the lead-up to his death and although the ipcc began immediately investigating the officers it was a further year before anybody looked into the conduct of the nhs staff there was also a delay in receiving kingsley\u2019s body for burial the family had to wait 18 months before the ipcc instructed the pathologist to take samples from kingsley\u2019s body janet also told me that the ipcc did not want to include in its investigation kingsley\u2019s own accounts of what took place when he was placed in the mary seacole unit in winson green he had been logging his experiences in a diary and the ipcc\u2019s initial reaction was that that evidence would not be included in its investigation the family had to meet them and insist that the commissioner rachel cerfontyne insert that information into her investigation report it took the ipcc a year and four months to complete its investigation into the conduct of the officers who had contact with kingsley in the lead-up to his death the dorset police force which did not come on to the scene until a year after kingsley had died as i have said took a year and nine months before they reported into the actions of nhs staff who had had contact with him in the lead-up to his death the file was passed to the crown prosecution service in october 2013 and it was only a couple of months ago that the cps made the decision not to prosecute any of the officers nhs staff or other individuals who had had contact with kingsley in the lead-up to his death only now do we have a preliminary inquest hearing coming up next month into kingsley\u2019s case and the full inquest will begin in 2015 nearly four years after he died as far as i can tell it does not get much more serious for the police than when somebody dies in their custody on their watch or very soon after coming into contact with them but the very clear lack of a process when a death in custody occurs and the inordinate length of time that it take to investigate these matters implies to me my constituents and in particular the burrell family a casual and complacent attitude towards deeply serious issues of concern to the whole community as well as to the deceased\u2019s family it is also deeply disrespectful there seems to be no empathy in this whole process or any recognition that these people are grieving and there is no thought given to how one of us might feel if we were in the shoes of kingsley\u2019s family or those of other families who have suffered in a similar way ", "i am pleased that the hon gentleman had the opportunity to put his constituent\u2019s case on the record restraint methods are an issue in cases involving deaths in police custody my focus is particularly on the way in which these investigations take place and the amount of time that it takes to conduct them if the process got results answered the questions that families have and ensured that the lessons that need to be learnt are in fact learnt i suppose one could tolerate the fact that sometimes the investigation takes a very long time but that is demonstrably not the case in the vast majority of cases involving deaths in police custody the process takes far far too long and it often leaves families with more questions and much greater pain that is not something that any of us should continue to accept the impact on the wider community is also very profound contentious deaths in police custody include an ever-increasing number of people with mental health illnesses and a disproportionately large number of people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and sometimes people from bme backgrounds with mental health issues if those cases are not seen to be taken seriously and investigations are not seen to be conducted with due seriousness and as quickly as possible trust in the system erodes seriously breeding justifiable anger and resentment and it is incumbent on all of us to do whatever we can to address that sometimes it does not seem that deaths in police custody are treated as cases in which potentially a crime has been committed the starting point should always be that we simply do not know what has happened so all possible scenarios are on the table but many families report that that is not how it feels to them in practice it feels as though a judgment has already been made and an end result is already in mind long before the investigation has begun despite the more than 900 deaths in police custody and several verdicts of unlawful killing there has yet to be a single successful prosecution a point that the hon member for gillingham and rainham (rehman chishti) also raised of any police officer involved in those deaths again that does not create much confidence in the wider public that the system is robust enough to ensure that when things go seriously wrong as they do in many of these cases we will get proper answers and accountability it is the lack of accountability that bothers so many of my constituents and it is the potential for lack of accountability that is keeping janet brown and her family awake at night they fear that their questions will never be answered and someone will never be held to account for the death of kingsley burrell there are other issues in relation to deaths in police custody people would expect sensitive and thorough handling of the investigation in the immediate aftermath of a death the so-called golden hours which are critical to evidence gathering and setting the direction and quality of the investigation that is to follow again many families report that that does not happen in practice the independent charity inquest also tells us of particular problems in relation to ipcc material and disclosure including ahead of inquest hearings for a bereaved family trying to engage in an ipcc investigation the organisation\u2019s reluctance to provide early and full disclosure or to explain clearly in language that ordinary people can understand not lawyer-speak why they cannot provide that evidence at the early stages of investigations and when they expect to do so fosters mistrust and is alienating and deeply unhelpful families often feel that they are not kept up to date and involved in the progress of the investigations of those who felt that they were kept involved and informed many reported dissatisfaction because the information given to them was inadequate difficult to obtain or delayed it seems to me that we have an ad hoc and chaotic system for investigations into deaths in police custody there is no agreed method or structure and no checklist of what needs to happen and when we need a uniform approach that allows professional judgment to be exercised on a case-by-case basis but always in the context of a coherent and consistent national protocol for the structure of the relationship between investigating officials and the bereaved and clear guidelines about the time frames that need to apply that is the only way we can give the families who suffer in this way some confidence that they will at least understand the system and the process that is supposed to apply and that they can hold to account the individuals involved i have mentioned the ipcc and i believe that it has lost the confidence of the public and is not fit for purpose it should be abolished and replaced by a new police standards authority whose job it would be to take action and raise standards when policing goes wrong such an authority should be tasked with creating the national set of guidelines or protocols that should apply to the investigation of deaths in police custody so that we can ensure that everyone knows what is meant to happen and when at this point however we still have the ipcc i know that the government have started their own review and it would be helpful if the minister when he responds to my remarks could set out exactly what is planned for that review but whoever ultimately has responsibility for these investigations whether the ipcc as now or another organisation its key task in the aftermath of a contentious death following police contact must be to begin immediately an independent effective accountable prompt public and inclusive investigation so that the rule of law is seen to be upheld and applied equally to all citizens including those in police uniform young constituents of mine made this point to me only today when i was doing an interview on a local community radio station they said  sometimes it feels that if you wear a uniform you are above the law you are there to enforce the law and to keep us all safe but you should not be above it they make a fair point it sometimes feels as if officers are not held properly to account that relates not only to the potential for successful prosecutions and convictions but to the sense that if misconduct occurs it will be challenged so often in relation to these cases we say  lessons must be learned and we imply that lessons will in fact be learned however in my experience the lessons arenot learned because the cases of deaths in police custody that keep occurring all seem to follow the same pattern and the same mistakes are often repeated the families involved all report the same things going wrong in the investigations the experience of the burrell family and the amount of time that it took for the investigations to conclude is very similar to that of other families who have suffered in similar circumstances that says to me that the phrase  lessons must be learned means nothing lessons are not learned and it is about time that we started to get that right if people are not held accountable if there are no prosecutions and if there are no grounds for misconduct charges at the very least we must fix the processes that apply when someone dies in these circumstances given that we know there is a problem with them that is one way in which we can start to give people confidence in the system again a few weeks ago janet brown said to me that she has not yet grieved for her son and she will not do so until all her questions about his death have been answered and until she feels at peace that she has done everything she can to get justice for him i think that making good decent people wait so long and placing them at the mercy of a very chaotic system is a scar on our collective conscience i really hope that the minister when he responds can give janet the burrell family and me some confidence that the government understand not only the policy implications of these cases but the emotional impact that they have and that he and the government will do something about it ", "i thank the minister for his introduction to this short bill which as he said aims to simplify the administrative process of paying class 2 nics for the self-employed apply measures from this year\u2019s finance bill now the finance act 2014 to nics and introduce a targeted anti-avoidance rule taar to tackle disguised self-employment made possible through employment intermediaries and offshore employers we support the measures and so will support second reading but we will examine in detail some of the expected practical impacts of the measures in committee as the house will know national insurance benefits are funded by a system of compulsory contributions on earnings paid by employees employers and the self-employed most of the income from nics goes into the national insurance fund to pay for contributory benefits including the state pension contributions-based jobseeker\u2019s allowance and bereavement benefits some nics money goes directly into the national health service nics are the second largest tax after income tax raising \u00a3108 billion in 2013-14 the self-employed make two types of national insurance contribution class 2 nics are paid by the self-employed at a flat weekly rate of \u00a32 75 a self-employed person can apply to be exempted from liability if their annual profits are under a certain threshold the so-called small earnings exemption which is currently set at \u00a35 885 class 4 nics are paid annually by self-employed persons on profits immediately derived from a trade profession or vocation that are chargeable to income tax class 4 nics are payable at a rate of 9% on profits between \u00a37 956 and \u00a341 865 and 2% on profits above \u00a341 865 until now payments of class 2 and class 4 nics have had to be made separately individuals may pay class 2 nics by direct debit either twice a year in january and july or monthly paid four months in arrears alternatively hmrc will issue two payment requests a year in contrast self-employed persons pay class 4 nics with income tax on completion of their self-assessment tax return from 2011 the dates on which payment of class 2 nics is due have been aligned with the dates for tax and self-assessment 31 january and 31 july each year but payment of both has continued to be made separately as the minister said when the office of tax simplification looked at these matters in 2012 it suggested bringing class 2 nics within self-assessment and that this would being administrative benefits to self-employed persons and businesses in july 2013 hmrc published a consultation document in which it noted that the present system places significant burdens on small business and that while class 2 nics accounted for less than 0 3% of the \u00a3102 billion-worth of nics collected by hmrc in 2012-13 they accounted for more than 40% of national insurance-related telephone calls to hmrc and the associated processing work that resulted the bill therefore changes the liability for class 2 nics so that it arises at the end of the tax year and not weekly as now and moves class 2 nics into self-assessment so that self-employed people can deal with their class 2 nics together with their income tax and class 4 nics we support the aim of making the system easier for self-employed people and reducing the administrative burden caused by the current arrangement of having two separate systems for collection of class 4 and class 2 nics almost one person in six is self-employed so this is a significant issue affecting a large number of people making the system easier to navigate is therefore welcome and of genuine practical benefit for the self-employed a number of specific issues arise as a result of this change on which we will seek greater clarification from ministers in committee however it would also be helpful if the exchequer secretary offered some further comments on the points i am about to raise as that could help to clarify the issues ahead of committee the first relates to the maternity allowance at present 25 000 self-employed women claim maternity allowance each year entitlement to maternity allowance is not assessed on self-employment and class 2 nics paid in a particular benefit year instead it is assessed over a test period of 66 weeks up to and including the week before the baby is due collecting class 2 nics at the end of the tax year means that some women may find that it appears as though they have not been paying class 2 nics during the period needed to make them eligible for the maternity allowance in order to address this problem the government have proposed measures in the bill that would enable women who have not had the opportunity to file a self-assessment return and pay class 2 nics to pay them early in order to secure maternity entitlement at the standard weekly rate however there is a danger that these proposals may be impractical women would have to make voluntary contributions before they filed their self-assessment returns and this demands a very high level of forward planning on their part the provisions may therefore require some additional clarification if the exchequer secretary or the financial secretary have had any additional representations on these points i know that some stakeholders have been raising such concerns it would be helpful if they set out their thinking the minister will be aware that the chartered institute of taxation has suggested that the government should review these changes at the earliest opportunity in two years i think to ensure that they have not resulted in a reduction in the number of claims for the standard rate of maternity allowance again it would be helpful to have an indication of the minister\u2019s current thinking on this point for the 650 000 self-employed households that claim universal credit these proposals will have a different impact universal credit regulations require the individual to report their income net of certain expenses on a monthly basis that net income is then used to establish their entitlement to universal credit certain safeguardsare built in so that if income from self-employment for an assessment period falls below a certain level the claimant\u2019s income is treated as being a higher amount called the minimum income floor because universal credit is assessed on a monthly basis if a claimant has to pay all their class 2 nics in one month this could push their earnings under the minimum income floor thereby reducing their universal credit for that month simplification should not come at the cost of hardship we will press the government for assurances that they have fully considered the potential impacts of this change along with the introduction of universal credit and the interplay between both policies the tax information and impact note suggests that the option of monthly payments will still be made available to self-employed persons and businesses however there is no provision for that in the bill a number of stakeholder groups have suggested that the retention of a monthly payment system would be of particular value to those on very low incomes who may struggle with one lump sum payment even accepting that for many people the total amount does not seem large or too onerous of course that is not necessarily the case for those on extremely low incomes and retaining the monthly payment option would therefore be helpful it is not clear why the note suggests something that the bill does not touch on i would be grateful for some further clarification on that the chartered institute of taxation points out that there will be a gap of 22 months between the collection of class 2 payments for 2014-15 and the collection of payments for 2015-16 as liability moves from a weekly basis to arising at the end of the tax year thereafter the payment of class 2 will be in arrears on 31 january following the end of the tax year this could potentially affect entitlements to benefits under the current system the entitlement to many contributory benefits is based on the claimant having paid contributions and operating on a pay-as-you-go basis have the government considered the cash-flow implications of class 2 nics coming in up to 10 months after the end of the tax year rather than being paid in-year as they are at the moment are they able to give us some more information on that today we will also seek reassurance and confirmation that moving class 2 into self-assessment will not adversely affect entitlement to contributory benefits these are significant changes and the government will need to ensure that they are properly advertised and that taxpayers are educated about them we do not want a situation to arise whereby people have gaps in their payments as i have said nics relate to eligibility for important benefits that people rely on we need greater reassurance from the government that they will have a full programme of education and information about the changes it is also fair to say that we will need a relatively widespread publicity programme ahead of april 2015 as existing direct debits will need to be stopped it would be helpful if the exchequer secretary could tell us what the government have planned in relation to educating taxpayers who will be affected by the changes as the financial secretary said the bill also extends measures introduced in the finance act 2014 to cover nics particularly in relation to follower notices accelerated payment notices and measures to tackle high-risk promoters of tax avoidance schemes during the passage of the finance bill we had an extensive debate on the issuesraised by the new provisions which are the same as those contained in this bill and we will continue to press ministers in committee on the practical arrangements for the measures on follower notices we welcomed the amendment made on report of the finance bill which brought in a right of appeal on three grounds where a follower notice has been issued outside of those three grounds however the only other option will be for taxpayers to seek a judicial review what further reassurances can ministers give that follower notices will be issued only in cases that are on all fours as it were with the precedent or lead case so that occasions where a taxpayer may have to resort to a judicial review are kept to a minimum it is important that the internal systems operated by her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs in deciding whether to issue a follower notice allow for the points of difference in a case to be considered rather than the process amounting to a more straightforward box-ticking exercise to determine eligibility for a notice now that the finance act is law i would be grateful if the government could set out what further work has been done on the approach and methodology that will be adopted by hmrc staff and officials as they make important decisions about whether to apply a follower notice to a particular case as the financial secretary has noted there has been considerable controversy and heated debate about whether accelerated payment notices amount to retrospection as we discussed in committee although we have put to him the concerns of stakeholders and constituents from all over the country i agree with him that from a legal perspective they are not retrospective per se the issue is more one of tax liability that has already been disputed and of where that liability sits we have therefore supported the measures relating to accelerated payment notices the government have assured the house that decisions about whether to issue an apn will be made only by hmrc staff with sufficient seniority who are at a high grade the financial secretary and i have had a number of discussions about hmrc staffing and resources so he will not be surprised to hear that i will be taking up those issues again the association of revenue and customs believes that hmrc faces a demographic time bomb with more than half its work force aged over 45 and 18% over 55 that proportion is even higher at senior level where about 30% of grade 6 employees are over 55 it is important to know how that will affect the implementation of apns we will need to be satisfied that there will be enough sufficiently experienced staff and that those who are due to retire are being replaced at the correct rate we have pressed ministers on the resourcing of hmrc and i note the financial secretary\u2019s comments in our previous debates about the expansion of the counter-avoidance team at hmrc again we will pick that up in greater detail in committee now that the finance act is law we must keep a close eye on implementation and resourcing especially given the high level of interest in such matters the first decisions made about follower notices and accelerated payment notices must be robust and stand up to scrutiny if they are to inspire confidence within the population of taxpayers the bill will introduce a new targeted anti-avoidance rule to cover the payment of national insurance contributions which sits alongside the provisions in this year\u2019s finance act aimed at tackling the issue ofemployment intermediaries who falsely label workers as self-employed to reduce their tax liabilities the problem is widespread and a government review found that at least 100 000 individuals working in this country were employed through an intermediary company that had no presence residence or place of business in the uk in many cases the employee was unaware that their payroll was located offshore and that tax was avoided on their earnings for workers falsely badged as self-employed particularly those who do not know that that is the case the impact is that they are not eligible for many of the benefits available for employed earners such as holiday and sickness pay this year\u2019s finance act amended legislation directly to address the issue in relation to the payment of income tax a worker will now be designated as an employee if they are under the supervision direction or control of someone else and in that case they must be paid through paye rather than as self-employed people that is a change from the previous designation under which a worker was deemed to be an employee if they provided their services personally it was found that many intermediaries could exploit the test by claiming that there was no obligation for the worker to provide their services personally and to get around that a clause was often inserted into a worker\u2019s contract stating that they could send someone else to do their work even though the employee in reality wanted that specific worker the role of the taar in this bill is to ensure that the new measures cannot be circumvented and that workers who would be employed earners if it were not for the intermediary arrangements are treated as employed earners the taar will allow hmrc to consider both the motive for setting up such an arrangement including whether it was set up with the motive of avoiding nics and what was achieved including whether it resulted in less nics being paid during debates on the finance bill we supported the new measures and the corresponding taar for income tax but we stressed the importance of considering the resource that hmrc would need both to implement the changes and to ensure that sufficient guidance was provided to those affected the same applies to this bill in addition we will continue to press as we did on the finance bill for further examination of the case for having deeming criteria to combat disguised employment in the construction industry particularly where such practices are a significant problem with self-employment levels at 40% compared with an average of 14% across all industries however the taar envisaged in this bill takes us forward in dealing with the problem and we will support it with those points i hope that i have given ministers sufficient notice of the debates that we will have as the bill progresses and i look forward to picking up those issues in greater detail in committee ", "to ask the secretary of state for education (1)  how many new academies and studio colleges have been closed by her department on the basis of lack of student numbers within their first year of trading (2)  how many academies and studio colleges created from a pre-existing education institution were closed by her department in the first year of trading (3)  how many academies and studio colleges which were entirely new businesses were closed by her department in the first year of trading ", "on a point of clarification i should say that my point about a stamp duty holiday concerned a proposal that we made in 2012 about the sale of the 4g spectrum i acknowledge that the government proceeded with our proposal in march 2010 for a stamp duty holiday ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr betts i congratulate the hon member for st albans (mrs main) on securing this important debate she was right that the matter of stamp duty has not been debated very much from a principled position we have had a number of debates in proceedings on finance bills about technical changes that the government have introduced to stamp duty particularly on the annual tax on enveloped dwellings but we have only rarely discussed the issue in the manner that we have today her securing of this debate has allowed some important issues to be raised the hon lady said that she hoped that we could move away from politics i am not sure about that as taxation and tax issues are perhaps politics in its purest form but i accept her point about partisanship in our approach to this debate people across the country in constituencies of conservative labour and liberal democrat members alike are all affected in various ways by stamp duty and the rising cost of housing her argument about the impact in london and the south-east on people on more modest incomes was particularly well made the hon member for esher and walton (mr raab) and other members discussed the slab structure that is a particularly problematic feature of this tax many commentators have called for reform of that structure he also raised our mansion tax policy so i hope you will forgive me mr betts if i take a moment to clarify the details of our proposals i make no apology for our policy to levy a mansion tax on properties worth \u00a32 million or more let me be clear only properties worth over \u00a32 million would be affected by our proposals and that limit would be raised each year either in line with the overall rate of inflation or and there is a strong case for this in line with the rise in house prices to make sure that more modest properties were not brought into the scope of the tax ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention i have received submissions from various experts on the matter and we are looking at it very closely we are clear about our start position we do not want more modest properties to be brought intothe mansion tax regime and we are looking carefully at the details of our ultimate policy to ensure that that does not happen i have had conversations with people about the issue but i cannot tell him today what we will ultimately be able to take forward ", "i am grateful to the hon lady for her intervention she is right i have received representations about the slab structure as i am sure has the minister it is one feature of stamp duty that causes particular consternation as we have heard from all hon members who have spoken in the debate today i cannot make a manifesto commitment today but i will make it clear later in my speech that we are alive to the issues raised today and that we are looking at them carefully i was pleased that the right hon member for wokingham (mr redwood) made a customary reference to the laffer curve i feel that these debates are not quite what they should be if there is not at least one reference to the laffer curve i was pleased that he was able to make that point i acknowledge the passionate views of hon members in this debate there has been a vigorous campaign on the issue i suspect that many hon members are less concerned about what i have to say about labour policy and more concerned about what the minister might do ahead of the autumn statement on 3 december we saw a similar vigorous campaign ahead of the budget earlier this year in the lead up to that budget the expectation was that there might be a doubling of the threshold to \u00a3250 000 and the introduction of a stamp duty tax credit system but the government did not ultimately go down that path i suspect we are seeing a similar build-up of lobbying for the government to do something in the autumn statement ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention i think the point that the deputy leader was making was about progressive taxation and the argument that those who are wealthier should pay more that is the thinking behind our mansion tax policy his government have presided over more people being brought into the 40p tax band for example and he could ask his minister about that today stamp duty is a matter of growing concern to the public and a significant burden on people wanting to buy a new home particularly first-time buyers i acknowledge the strength of feeling among hon members and throughout the country but i am not in a position to make a spending commitment via this debate stamp duty brings in a large and growing amount of revenue and any policy change in this area would have to be fully funded our start point as an incoming labour government in 2015 would be the current government\u2019s spending plans for 2015-16 and any change to that spending round would have to be fully funded that has been the thinking behind the policies we have unveiled they are all fully funded and primarily involve switching from one area of spend to another to deal with some of our child care priorities and other measures the difficult financial position that an incoming labour government in 2015 would inherit means that we would have to make some difficult choices given that our focus has been wider reform of the housing market and how it might stimulate greater home ownership in particular the problem of housing supply has become acute in the past few years and is causing many problems such as people having to rely on the bank of mum and dad and home ownership occurring much later in life the hon member for st albans made a point about that and it is true we are seeing the biggest housing crisis in a generation and we are not building even half the homes we need to keep up with demand the shortage of decent homes has much wider social and economic costs and we heard about some of those relating to inflexibility in the labour market as well as the impact on people in overcrowded homes and the impact on children\u2019s health and educational outcomes what can we do to build more homes that must be the centre point of getting more sense and fairness into our housing market we supported the help to buy scheme but we would have preferred a scheme that focused more on first-time buyers our policy shows that the government have simply not understood that boosting demand without boosting supply risks putting prices out of reach of the very families and young people we particularly want to help to get on the housing ladder that is why we have committed ourselves to building 200 000 homes a year by 2020 that is probably not enough and we should build many more than that but it is an ambitious start point we currently have a housing commission led by sir michael lyons which is looking at a detailed road map so that we may be able to deliver our vision ", "i take on board the hon lady\u2019s point she is certainly right about the interplay between the help to buy policy and the burden that remains with stamp duty as i have said in constrained financial circumstances difficult choices must be made and we have preferred at this stage to look at how we might do the one central thing that we know can reform the housing market and get more homes within the reach of more people build more homes that must be the start point and that is the key issue with the help to buy scheme it is not a bad policy and we should be helping people to buy homes but we must boost supply and we are failing to do that at the moment ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention we have made it clear that that is a central commitment of our party we acknowledge that we simply did not build enough homes when we were in government no government for 20-odd years have built enough homes we recognise that without boosting supply we will simply not have fairness and sense in our housing market that is why we set up the lyons commission we want to ensure that we have a detailed road map we will unveil it in our manifesto ahead of the general election and it will show exactly how we will realise our ambition in government ", "i disagree with the hon lady i think that it is right to set targets and ambitions and it is right that we look to such experts to help us to get to that position we are looking partly at the expense of land and the housing market in different parts of the country we will discuss those issues in greater detail as we get closer to producing our manifesto ", "i make this point about the last labour government as well as the current government no government have built anywhere near enough homes to ensure that supply keeps up with demand that is why we are in this position with the housing market i cannot pre-empt some of the proposals under discussion in the lyons commission but i am sure that we will return to the debate when we unveil what our road map towards the pledge of 200 000 homes a year looks like as i have said given the very constrained financial circumstances and the difficult choices that have to be made we have focused our energies on measures to increase supply we did also put forward to the government back in 2012 i am sure that the minister remembers a proposal for the government to implement immediately it was about using the sums raised by the sale of the 4g spectrum towards getting more homes built and towards a stamp duty holiday of two years for first-time buyers that measure could have been taken forward by the government it might not have helped the constituency of the hon member for st albans but it would have helped first-time buyers looking at properties below the \u00a3250 000 threshold changing the thresholds and providing holidays was something that we looked at and implemented towards the end of our term in office as we sought to stimulate the market post the financial crash these are issues that we have considered in the context of a stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers in this parliament they are issues that we continue to receive representations on and continue to look at very closely as i have said i am not in a position to make any commitments today but i suspect that the commitment that government members are looking for is from the minister who may or may not indulge them when he responds ", "it is a pleasure to wind up this relatively short but interesting and important debate despite points of difference and disagreement it has provided some thoughtful and wide-ranging speeches from both sides of the house proving that it is quality not quantity that counts two excellent examples were provided by my hon friend the member for aberdeen south (dame anne begg) and my right hon friend the member for neath (mr hain) my hon friend the member for aberdeen south made an important point about complexity and expressed her fear that increasing complexity as a result of the government\u2019s changes to pensions might hamper efforts to get younger people to engage with their pensions she also rightly highlighted the increased risk of mis-selling that could result from any such complexity i shall come back to that issue later she also highlighted the importance of governance in relation to the collective defined-contributions schemes that are being introduced by the bill she was right to say that there was no obvious reason to omit those governance arrangements from the bill and to leave them instead to be dealt with in secondary legislation it is difficult to understand why the bill is vague on that point and i hope that the financial secretary to the treasury will be able to illuminate the house further on that when he responds to the debate my right hon friend the member for neath who is not in his place at the moment made a powerful contribution to the debate in which he set out the challenges posed by a rapidly ageing population they are one reason why so much attention has been focused on pension arrangements he also noted the challenges posed by the greater need for adult social care thatresults from a rapidly ageing population the interplay between those changes and the increasing burden on the present younger generation and future generations he talked about our expectation of what those burdens would be like in the coming years he was right to give us an historical perspective particularly in relation to mis-selling during the years before 1997 pensions are an important issue for people they worry about their retirement and their personal social care needs and about whether they will be able to cope with those needs as and when they arise they also worry about whether they will be able to leave anything behind for their children as people live longer it is more important than ever that they should make the best possible choices for themselves as legislators politicians need to ensure that the range of options available to people and the breadth of the arrangements they can make for their retirement are fit for purpose especially as we are all living much longer that poses great challenges for us all in that context the bill\u2019s establishment of collective defined-contributions schemes cdc schemes is a welcome step in increasing the range of options available to people as they plan for their retirement we will therefore not oppose the bill on second reading although there are areas in which we might seek to extend or strengthen it in committee or on report as i said we support cdcs in principle in sharing risk they have the potential to give people a more adequate and reliable retirement income than individual defined-contributions schemes because unlike those schemes cdcs can pool risk across and between generations given the difficulties and anxiety that many people feel about their living standards at the moment we want to support working people who are struggling to set money aside for the future we need to ensure that they have access to pension schemes that they can trust to give good value for money and a decent income in retirement cdcs are also well supported by the public research by the institute for public policy research carried out at the end of 2013 found that there was strong public support for a collective pension it was the most popular of the options the ippr tested and it appealed across those with different income levels life stages and ages if cdcs are to be well taken up and succeed strong governance arrangements clearly need to be in place that point was made by my hon friend the member for aberdeen south as my hon friend the member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east (gregg mcclymont) said the bill is currently silent on governance arrangements for cdcs the highest standards of governance are needed for schemes that are even more opaque than defined-contributions schemes because they have to manage pooled assets and conduct smoothing the silence in the bill occurs despite the government\u2019s consultation  reshaping workplace pensions for future generations which stated collective schemes are complex and can be opaque because of the indirect relationship between contributions and benefits this necessitates strong standards of communication and governance we intend collective schemes to be overseen by experienced fiduciaries acting on behalf of members taking decisions at scheme level and removing the need for individuals to make difficult choices over fund allocations and retirement income products failure to require all schemes to have trustees means that we will potentially have some cdcs run by trustees and others offered by private firms that seek to maximise their short-term returns the minister will know that we have consistently argued that all workplace pension schemes must be run by trustees and have a legal duty to prioritise savers\u2019 interests governance arrangements remain an issue for other defined-contributions schemes which make up the majority of what is available the government could have taken more steps in the bill to strengthen the governance of those schemes the government have declined to impose trustee boards but have instead opted to require independent governance committees we are concerned that they will be neither independent nor governing in nature in any event igcs contain serious conflicts of interest so we will argue in committee that the government should instead follow labour\u2019s lead and require all pension schemes to have trustees and a legal duty to prioritise the interests of savers above all others another issue discussed in the debate which the opposition will continue to press the government on in committee is scale the issue was raised by one government member and the minister did engage with it when the point was made about whether small and medium-sized enterprises might be able to introduce cdcs or whether this would be the preserve of larger employers he rightly said that it was going to depend primarily on scale and how popular these schemes end up being the bill however contains no measures that will help promote the scale which most independent observers believe is necessary for cdcs and workplace pensions in general to do the best they can for employees we have long argued that measures to promote scale are vital to ensure the best possible outcomes for savers so the government could for example require that automatic transfers default into aggregators and the criteria necessary for qualifying as an aggregator should include scale one or more of those schemes which met the qualifying criteria to be aggregators under our approach may then opt to be a cdc pension scheme as my hon friend the member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east noted the house of commons briefing note on the bill also says that certain conditions such as large scale and strong governance appear necessary for cdcs to operate successfully three-quarters of respondents to the consultation prior to the bill thought that government intervention would be needed to create the scale necessary for schemes to offer guarantees we will look in detail at issues around scale and governance when the bill is considered in committee we will also look at the national employment savings trust which is a trusted body for providing workplace pension schemes it could potentially offer retirement income products or cdc and in doing so help constrain the industry and ensure that it provides decent products to all savers however to do so most efficiently it would need to have its restrictions lifted as was mentioned earlier the government said in july 2013 that they would legislate to lift the restrictions as soon as possible but they have not yet done so it would be helpful if theminister told us whether that is something that will be taken forward by the government and when it will be discussed in committee the second part of the debate dealt with the new arrangements around flexibility as my hon friend the member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stated at the outset we have supported greater flexibility in relation to pension arrangements but we have set out three tests for the new flexibility first is there robust advice for people who are saving for their retirement secondly is the system fair to those on middle and lower incomes who want a secure retirement income thirdly are the government sure that the changes will not result in extra costs to the state either through social care or by increasing housing benefit bills in relation to the first test the expectation is that the government will propose an amendment to the draft bill around the guidance guarantee as it has not yet been published it is not clear whether it will be robust enough it would be helpful if the minister gave additional information to the house now so that we are not waiting until the bill reaches committee before we know what is happening about guidance as many members noted guidance will have to be well thought through and reflect the practical steps that people take as they move towards retirement to be effective in practice guidance will need to include a discussion of the effects of drawdown on the individual\u2019s tax situation it will also need to explain the consequences of decisions regarding the different forms of saving on the extent to which local authorities can seek to recover sums for long-term care the government\u2019s response to the consultation  freedom and choice in pensions indicates that drawdown is likely to be treated similarly to annuities in that income and not capital is assessed again that is something that we will have to look at and examine further in committee some specific questions arise as well for example if guidance is a single event how will it assist an individual seeking the necessary later event perhaps 20 years later of switching from a drawdown product to an annuity drawdown products are likely to be insufficient on their own for savers and individuals will need to insure against longevity risk to ensure that they do not run out of money during their retirement will there be a requirement for products to include a regular review of when the optimal moment for switching to an annuity should occur we have had a number of debates both on the floor of the house and in committee around the issue of advice and guidance and the very clear difference that there is between the two there is a fear among many members across the house that guidance on pension changes alone might not be enough to help people make the best possible choice ultimately the course that the government choose will have to be carefully scrutinised and reviewed as i have said this matter is of great interest to members on both sides of the house ", "no we have not called for regulated advice but i am sure that the hon gentleman will agree that these are big decisions for people we must ensurethat what the government envisage will be up to the job of ensuring that they have all the information they need before then to make the best possible choice as i have said we have had a number of debates on this subject and the government have given us some idea of the guidance they envisage but i think we will have to return to these issues in committee to ensure that that guidance is as robust as it can possibly be ", "to the extent that we have this debate about advice and guidance i am sure that the hon gentleman will recall that it was the chancellor who said in his budget speech that advice would be provided to people about making their decisions we then moved quickly into the world of guidance and the two are as i am sure the hon gentleman will acknowledge very different that is why we are concerned that the guidance on offer will not be quite as good as we might expect if advice were on offer that is why it will be important that members on both sides of the house stress test the final package that the government come up with the tuc has rightly questioned whether guidance on its own is sufficient it states independent guidance is clearly better than that provided by company sales teams but half an hour of the best possible advice will not equip people for what could be thirty years of managing their pension pot\u2026 expecting the market to deliver retirement income solutions that work for the great majority is unrealistic the annuities market was broken but what we need is the same careful consideration of policy consumer preference and evidence that led to pensions auto-enrolment it is clear that a number of very complex factors will play against each other with some inherent tensions that were noted by members on both sides of the house in their speeches it is important that we stress test the measures properly in committee the bill introduces a number of measures that we support and as i have highlighted there are some issues on which we think that the bill could be strengthened we look forward to picking up those issues with the minister in committee ", "given the importance of accurately calculating the tax yield from households and businesses and that of ensuring that both pay their fair share of tax will the chief secretary tell us when following the letter from the head of the uk statistics authority the chancellor willcorrect the record and apologise for giving the house incorrect figures that inflated the success of his tax avoidance programme ", "to ask the

interesting debate but i wish to press the new clause to a division ", "my hon friend is absolutely right about the findings of that report and we know that this is a real problem particularly for people in the construction industry ", "i am grateful to my hon friend who is right that this is a long-standing problem for governments of all colours and persuasions who have for too long been

with disguised self-employment is that the unhealthy level of self-employment in the construction industry 40% compared with an average of 14% across all other industries does not offer a sustainable skill supply for emerging growth opportunities or a change in the economic weather employers who want to invest in their staff and employ directly are losing out to companies that use payroll companies which because they are paying less tax can sometimes offer slightly higher pay to poach skilled staff in july 2009 we published proposals to tackle the problems of false self-employment in the construction industry but it was not until last year\u2019s budget that the government took an interest in the problem when they announced that they would consult on proposals to tackle tax avoidance by intermediaries based offshore who provided labour services to uk companies we arestill waiting for the government\u2019s response to their consultation on onshore intermediaries which closed i think in march last year the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend the member for leeds west (rachel reeves) reviewed the issue and based on an investigation of the available evidence and widespread consultation with the industry we have proposed that workers should automatically be deemed to be treated as employees for tax purposes if they meet criteria that most people would regard as obvious signs that they were employees rather than self-employed subcontractors it is important to note that the measure would not only close a costly tax loophole but remove a perverse financial incentive for those workers whom most would regard as being in an employment relationship to be classified as self-employed such a shift would be good for the construction sector and its work force too we want the government to take further action today to consider the issue and prepare the report envisaged in our new clause the third area in which we seek greater action is that of dormant companies it has been estimated that 30% of all uk companies are not asked to submit tax returns one explanation that has been given is that those companies are either dormant or are not liable to pay tax in the uk as they trade exclusively overseas once companies have declared themselves dormant they are exempted from filing a corporation tax return for five years for some companies that window could be used as an opportunity to trade with tax impunity and yesterday we set out our proposals whereby we will require annual confirmation of dormancy and will further explore the possibility of banks\u2019 automatically informing hmrc when there is activity in supposedly dormant accounts that would deal with an issue of tax evasion rather than tax avoidance but it is important that the tax lost as a result of weaknesses in the rules of dormancy is firmly on the government\u2019s radar and it has not been to date as i have set out tackling tax avoidance and closing the tax gap effectively remains a top priority for the public this government\u2019s record is not good enough our new clause pushes for greater action on three important issues and practical measures that can help to close the tax gap we hope that it will have the support of the house this evening ", "that may be the hon gentleman\u2019s view but i am simply pointing out that in order to fall foul of the gaar someone has to have engaged in the most egregious form of abuse it seems odd to me that falling foul of the gaar will not therefore attract any additional penalty on top of the tax that is in dispute ", "no i am going to make some more progress tax avoidance and how to tackle it effectively and thereby close the tax gap remains a real problem for this government hence our new clause we need more action from this government and where they fail the next labour government will step in we are pushing the government for greater action in three specific areas let me take each in turn ", "given the cuts at hmrc this government\u2019s record on hmrc resources which is a topic i regularly debate with the minister is not one for members on the government benches to show off about first let me take the issue of the quoted eurobonds exemption that was originally implemented to make it easier for companies to obtain finance from the international bond markets by excluding corporate debt listed on recognised stock exchanges from uk withholding tax making it easier for companies to obtain finance on the international bond markets is a legitimate objective that we support however as covered in a spate of high-profile media stories last year the exemption can also be used for tax avoidance purposes allowing companies to shift profits out of the uk in the form of interest payments without making any tax payment as hmrc has noted in recent years a number of groups have issued eurobonds between companies in the same group and listed them on stock exchanges in territories such as the channel islands and cayman islands where they are not actually traded in effect the conversion of existing inter-company debt into quoted eurobonds enables acompany to make gross payments of interest out of the uk to a fellow group company where otherwise deduction of tax would be required the government consulted on the issue in 2012 with hmrc proposing to amend the eurobond exemption so it would not apply where the eurobond is issued to a fellow group company and listed on a stock exchange on which there is no substantial or regular trading in the eurobond hmrc stated the effect of the amended rule would be to leave untouched the quoted eurobond exemption for the overwhelming majority of eurobond issues it would deny the exemption only in the case of intra-group eurobond issues that appear to be undertaken for the purpose of circumventing the requirement to deduct tax at source rather than being directed at the raising of third party finance despite hmrc estimating that the proposed restriction could have an extra impact of \u00a3200 million a year in their response the government stated that they did not intend to proceed with it why not well the government said they made that decision in the  light of the responses they received around a number of technical issues and after respondents questioned the positive exchequer effect set out in the impact assessment that is simply not good enough we say that abuse of the exemption can be shut down and must be shut down our proposals will explore removing the exemption where bonds are issued to connected persons such as where a subsidiary issues a bond to a corporate parent or its private equity fund owners to minimise disruption to private equity funds using the mechanism to simplify investor rebate claims under double taxation treaties we would explore either offering an exemption for private equity partnerships where all or the vast majority of the ultimate beneficiaries would qualify for double taxation relief or streamlining the withholding tax rebate process in consultation with the industry so there is a mechanism to shut down the abuse of the exemption it could and should have been taken up by the government the estimates of the exchequer impact of closing the loophole range from \u00a31 billion to the government\u2019s estimate of about \u00a3200 million with many more commentators saying that they would place it at about \u00a3500 million in a letter to me dated 4 march 2014 the minister said some newspapers quoted a figure of \u00a3500m for the tax at risk this appears to be based on the unrealistic assumption that the interest paid out of the uk had not been restricted for tax purposes and that the beneficial recipient would not be entitled to gross payment you will appreciate that i cannot discuss individual cases but hmrc has confirmed to me that computational adjustments are frequently made consequently the \u00a3500m sum is very wide of the mark any change here will not raise any significant yield i was interested in that response for which i was grateful and which i received after i had tabled a number of questions about the quoted eurobond exemption because it displayed a concerning lack of clarity the minister says that the numbers quoted are  wide of the mark but he does not say where the mark actually is that is surprising given that hrmc and the minister have examined this in detail and have consulted on it and given that they tell us that  computational adjustments are regularly made for it despite that still no figure has been given ", "i am grateful to the minister for his intervention and i hope he does not take it as a personal slight that i did not on that occasion take him up on the offer of a meeting i will try not to be patronised by the suggestion that these matters are far too complicated for me to understand and that i am getting my information only from newspaper articles ", "i may yet take the minister up on it but it would be a mistake for him to think that our proposal has been made without consulting experts who are very much engaged on the issue of eurobonds i am confident that the information we have put out as a result of our business taxation paper launched yesterday is accurate and that we have considered the different legal and other ramifications of limiting the abuse of the exemption as it currently stands ", "i am going to make a bit more progress let us say for the sake of argument that the figure is close to the \u00a3200 million or so set out in the original hmrc consultation i was surprised that the minister did not think that sum would merit action the tone of his comments to me suggested that he considered that to be a small sum and so it was not worth going ahead with the attempt to close down the abuse of the exemption i am afraid that as an argument that is not something that i am prepared to buy why well in this year\u2019s finance bill committee we have debated and supported a measure in clause 61 on business premises renovation allowances ", "i am grateful to the minister for that intervention i was talking about the overall yield on the difference between the government and the opposition in relation to the technical way in which to seek to close down the exemption the government consultation looked at situations in which the bonds are not being actively traded we agreed that that was not an appropriate way in which to close the exemption but as i have said we would explore removing the exemption where the bonds are issued to connected persons and in doing so we would look at mechanisms to simplify rebate claims under the double taxation treaties and consider in consultation with industry streamlining the withholding tax rebate process ", "i would be happy to have a long conversation with the hon gentleman about all the different experts but let me just say that our experts were drawn from across the business and legal worlds they gave advice and assisted us in thinking through many of the issues related to the abuse of the quoted eurobonds exemption i will not take this opportunity to put that advice on the record because i have not sought the permission of those experts to make public some of the assistance and advice that they have given to us however our paper is thorough on the issue of how we would seek to close down abuse of the exemption that tells the house that we have considered these issues deeply and have thought through all of the problems that might arise from the different attempts to close down the exemption i was talking about yield and how far a potential yield should dictate the government\u2019s policy in deciding whether to close down an abuse of the system i referred to the business premises renovation allowance in clause 61 the government have taken action to close down some of the abuse associated with that allowance but the impact on the exchequer was we were told negligible so we see the government proactively closing down a loophole in which the exchequer impact is expected to be minimal but where a loophole exists that is estimated to cost the exchequer upwards of \u00a3200 million a year they do nothing how can they justify their decision not to take action to prevent the abusive use of the eurobonds exemption when there are hundreds of millions of pounds at stake the potential complexity of the change that would be required is no justification for the failure to act it has not stopped this government on other measures including on the business premises renovation allowance there seems to be no reason not money complexity or anything else that could stop the government from acting other than intense lobbying from the affected parties seeking to protect their own interests the government have failed to act but our new clause gives them the opportunity to do so if they do not act the next labour government will ", "i want to make some more progress secondly we want to push the government to take action on disguised employment in the construction industry employers falsely declaring their workers to be self-employed is a long-standing and well-documented issue in the sector although there is of course some necessary and genuine self-employment in the sector employers are currently able to declare someone to be self-employed when they exhibit all of the characteristics of an employee that results in three problems the first is a cost to the exchequer the treasury has estimated that that entailed a static cost of \u00a3350 million in 2009 and the house of commons library recently produced an estimate of about \u00a3500 million the second problem is that those falsely classified as self-employed are denied their employment rights that means that workers might work for the same company for several years effectively as an employee while not receiving any of the resulting employment rights such as sick pay holiday pay and maternity and paternity leave ", "i will turn at length to costings of the abuse of the quoted eurobonds exemption but it is certainly true that many of the estimates of how much it might be costing the exchequer have placed the figure at around \u00a3500 million let me start with the context and explain the thinking behind our new clause public concern about tax avoidance is high and this is a problem not only for the government but for parties across the house the setting of tax rates decisions about tax reliefs and the collection of tax are among the most important functions of government if the system is not working as well as it could be that needs to be addressed over the past couple of years there have been a number of high-profile media stories focused on the tax arrangements of particular companies and individuals as a result of which it is fair to say public trust in the tax system has been eroded the deficit as we know is high and will not now be cleared by 2015 as the government promised when they came to office in 2010 it will not in fact be eliminated until well into the next parliament ", "i think the hon gentleman and other government members should apologise for the fact that their government have delivered a huge tax cut for millionaires while households are on average \u00a3974 a year worse off that is a deplorable record and the government should apologise for it we have already discussed at length today the fact that ordinary working people in our country are worse off as a result of this government\u2019s economic plan as i have said households are \u00a3974 a year worse off as a result of tax and benefit changes and wages will be 5 6% lower in 2015 than they were in 2010 we also know that it is the richest 1% of the country who have benefited most from the recovery with working people facing a cost of living crisis it is vital that everyone pays their fair share and that we restore public trust when ordinary people are struggling with their household budgets which are stretched ever thinner it is understandablethat there will be increasing anger if they feel that others are successfully avoiding tax and the government are failing to do enough about it the same goes for businesses too we know that small and medium-sized enterprises are struggling with business rates for example which have gone up since 2010 many businesses are now paying more in rates than they do in rent businesses that do the right thing when it comes to tax are understandably frustrated and angry when they see others that do not play by the rules and they are right to think that there should be a level playing field so that those who do the right thing are not penalised because others get away with not paying their fair share high-profile cases of tax avoidances have therefore undermined public trust in company taxation and hit businesses that play by the rules our best measure of how well the system is working is the tax gap which is effectively the amount of uncollected tax in the economy which has risen under this government by \u00a31 billion to a total of \u00a335 billion ", "i know the minister will say that it has gone down in percentage terms but only by 0 1% i assume that that was the intention behind the intervention he was about to make ", "focusing on the actual figure is important it concentrates the mind when assessing the scale of the task both for this government and the successor government in 2015 by anyone\u2019s analysis \u00a335 billion is a huge sum which if collected would make a very significant difference to the nation\u2019s finances ", "my hon friend makes an excellent point he is of course right that this is a huge sum of money and that people are rightly concerned that \u00a335 billion-worth of tax is potentially going uncollected in our country ", "the truth is that any tax gap however big or small is unacceptable to the public and strong action should always be taken to tackle it i was about to say that i am grateful to the hon gentleman and that it was \u00a332 billion as i say that is too high and it has gone up to \u00a335 billion under this government these large sums of money shake the public\u2019s confidence when it comes to believing that the government are doing everything they can to tackle tax avoidance ", "i will take further interventions later but i want to make some progress what else has been happening on this government\u2019s watch the government have raised expectations in respect of some aspects of their tax avoidance policy but they have not been met in particular we have put this point to the minister on many occasions the swiss deal which was supposed to bring in \u00a33 12 billion a sum that would have gone some way towards making a dent in the tax gap has in fact brought in only \u00a3818 million i know the minister will say that the figures were okayed by the independent office for budget responsibility when the costings were put in the red book but that does not mean that the minister can simply get away with it at the end of the day there is an unexplained and substantial difference between what was meant to happen as a result of that deal and what did in fact happen raising questions about the substance of the deal another feature of public debate as the issue of tax avoidance has shot up the public agenda relates to her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs if we are to close the tax gap we need hmrc to be as effective as possible last year\u2019s public accounts committee report  tax avoidance tackling marketed avoidance schemes found that hmrc did not know how much it spent on its anti-avoidance work and had not evaluated the effectiveness of its efforts it calls for hmrc to improve its recording and monitoring of the cost of its anti-avoidance work and to set out clearly how it will evaluate its anti-avoidance strategy this is a substantial gap in knowledge again it has a direct impact on the government\u2019s ability to tackle tax avoidance effectively and thereby close the tax gap ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention but as i just said the tax gap has widened despite those efforts it has gone up by \u00a31 billion or more the public accounts committee also raised concerns about the monitoring of tax relief at hmrc and the treasury in 2013 there were 1 128 tax reliefs in the uk taxation system a number that continues to grow tax reliefs can range from fundamental components of the tax system such as the level of the personal allowance to tax expenditures with more specific objectives to change behaviour such as film tax relief they play an important role in the tax system but can be abused indeed even in this finance bill the government have had to take steps to close down the abuse of tax reliefs it is therefore very worrying that the public accounts committee has concluded there is a lack of transparency and accountability for tax reliefs and no adequate system of control following their introduction hmrc and hm treasury share responsibility for tax reliefs but there is no accounting officer with responsibility for the stewardship of tax reliefs as there would be for other elements of public spending in 2010 hm treasury committed to developing a framework for the introduction of new reliefs however no measures have been implemented so far in december 2013 this is relevant to what the hon member for dover (charlie elphicke) said a moment ago there were just four full-time officers in the fugitive unit trying to catch 124 hmrc fugitives the government launched a  most wanted campaign in august 2012 but earlier this year it was found that just four fugitives had been caught since the publication of the list moreover it was admitted that of the 32  most wanted 11 could not be located if the government are to support their claim that they are succeeding in the fight against tax avoidance and evasion they must be able to demonstrate that they will catch those who break and abuse the rules and will prosecute them to the full extent of the law ", "my hon friend has made his point powerfully and in his characteristic way as we can see despite the government\u2019s claims their record of tackling tax avoidance is simply not good enough in a number of areas they will say that the avoidance measures in this bill are radical and bold and are evidence of a commitment to tackling avoidance we have supported the measures relating to follower notices accelerated payment notices and the need to tackle promoters of tax avoidance schemes although we have questioned the minister about some of the deeply felt concerns of those who will be affected by the follower notices regime and by accelerated payment notices which have caused a great deal of debate outside the house however although those measures have received the opposition\u2019s support the fact is that they are not revenue raisers they will simply bring in money that the government were expecting to collect but which had been clogging up the various back channels and alleyways of the legal system ", "i think the government should adopt an across-the-board strategy i think they should deal with companies of all sizes as well as individuals who engage in the various types of tax avoidance and evasion i have mentioned a number of areas where there is concern about the government\u2019s action to date and about their record of being able to narrow the tax gap the government\u2019s other flagship policy introduced last year is the general anti-abuse rule of course it will take some time for the gaar to settle in as it is a new measure and it is not yet clear how it will operate in practice because it has not yet been the subject of a court case it is however striking that no penalties regime associated with abuse falls within its remit one would have thought that such a regime was a deterrent and that the government would want to make it clear that the type of abuse caught by the gaar abuse of the most egregious nature would not be tolerated however it seems that an individual who fell foul of the gaar having engaged in the most egregious form of tax abuse would incur no penalty but would merely be required to pay the amount that had been disputed that strikes me as an interesting omission from the gaar and the government\u2019s arsenal of measures to tackle tax avoidance ", "i beg to move that the clause be read a second time we now come to the last of our debates on the finance bill today new clause 12 would require a report by the chancellor within six months of royal assent setting out further proposals to reduce the tax advantages arising from tax arrangements that are abusive it makes particular reference to the quoted eurobonds exemption disguised employment in the construction sector and the use of dormant companies as a means of tax avoidance the new clause would require an assessment of the impact of all three on total receipts paid to the exchequer ", "the minister will acknowledge that the ifs has said that this whole area would benefit from greater research now that hmrc has more data that research would perhaps produce more accurate results will he take that point on board and support our new clause ", "we have had a good debate on our new clause as i expected the tone of the minister\u2019s remarks suggests that he will not take the opportunity to support it despite accepting the fact that the institute for fiscal studies has joined us in saying that more research data and analysis are necessary if we are to get a complete answer on the issues of data and yield relating to a 50p top rate of tax i note that he did not answer my earlier question about that if he wants to say to the country that his government have cut the 50p rate with justification he should not have shown himself to be afraid of such data the government should have agreed to the new clause as its proposals would have settled the matter once and for all i ask again what does the minister have to be afraid of we will be pressing the new clause to a vote ", "i am glad that my hon friend has put that point on the record debate interrupted (programme order this day) ", "i am grateful to my right hon friend for his intervention i was about to come to the topic of tax avoidance which i hope will answer his question another weakness in the government\u2019s argument is the proposition that behavioural change or tax avoidance means it is not worth while maintaining the rate at 50p this must be the only example of tax avoidance resulting in a huge tax cut rather than in government crackdowns to tackle and fight tax avoidance which they are normally so quick to say they are doing the chancellor is on record as saying that he considers tax avoidance to be  morally repugnant but in the case of the 50p rate he rewarded a particular form of avoidance with a tax cut i wonder if that has ever happened for people on middle and lower incomes i think not the message that this government have sent out is that if people are sufficiently well off to pay for advisers who can tell them how to avoid paying the 50p rate and are organised enough and can lobby the government they are up for a tax cut but everyone else sorry is simply worse off ", "my hon friend is right the government always tell us how proud they are of their record on tax avoidance but how much effort did they put into thinking of ways in which they couldprotect revenue from the 50p rate the government have introduced the general anti-abuse rule the so-called gaar which may have helped they could have thought about a targeted anti-avoidance rule a so-called taar they could also have looked to hmrc to do more i understand that no specific resources are allocated within hmrc to protect revenue from the 50p rate a range of measures could have been taken to protect revenue before rushing to abolish the rate the government could and should have looked at protecting that revenue first they were quick enough to publish an analysis saying that on their evidence it was not raising much money because of behavioural change but their instinct was not to say  let\u2019s look at how we might see off that behavioural change they did not commission a report or publish anything on that they jumped straight to cutting it at the earliest opportunity more evidence that this is an ideological and political choice made because they wanted to prioritise the tax cuts for the richest while ordinary working people are worse off ", "my hon friend is absolutely right we will debate later the issues in relation to tax avoidance and shares for rights ", "let us see the report the minister has had many opportunities in finance bill debates where the opposition have tabled amendments and new clauses calling for such a report he has not produced one i have no confidence that he will go away today and ask his officials at hmrc suddenly to produce a report if he has such a report in mind he should accept our new clause and we can then have that debate we have said that we will increase the rate to 50p we believe that that can raise money and will be a good part of a much fairer deficit reduction policy the truth is that there was no justification for giving a huge tax cut to the richest in our country we now know that bonuses are up by 83% for those in the financial sector while ordinary working people are worse off now and will be worse off in 2015 compared with 2010 wages will be 5 6% down at the end of this parliament from what they were at the beginning the government have not ruled out cutting the additional rate back down to 40p we know that this is the ardent desire of many of their back benchers perhaps when the minister replies he could tell the house whether the government are planning any further cuts they have ducked the opportunity on previous occasions to confirm that they will not go down from45p to 40p it will be good to hear from the minister whether that is the case the government\u2019s priorities are all wrong ordinary working people continue to struggle with their finances and the link between the wealth of the nation and the money in people\u2019s pockets and in their household budgets is broken this finance bill does nothing to change the reality of the lives of millions in our country yet government members want to cut taxes for the richest ", "the hon gentleman has made that point in previous debates and i repeat the answer that i gave then we have said that we would increase the rate to 50p in the next parliament as we get the deficit down i could not be clearer than that it is the richest in our country who are benefiting the most from the recovery delivered by the government the return of economic growth has overwhelmingly benefited the top 1% as shown by analysis of hmrc figures by the house of commons library which covered the year when gdp growth returned and the top rate of income tax on earnings over \u00a3150 000 was reduced the share of post-tax income of the top 1% of taxpayers 300 000 people rose from 8 2% in 2012-13 to 9 8% in 2013-14 yet during the same period the bottom 90% 27 million taxpayers have seen their share of post-tax income fall this cut to the 50p rate cannot be justified when the deficit is high and will not be eliminated towards the end of the next parliament labour in government will increase the rate back to 50p to help us to get the deficit down in a fairer way just as we have said that we want the office for budget responsibility to have powers to audit manifestos ahead of the next general election because we believe that that scrutiny will add to public understanding about the choices that are being made a call the government only last week rejected so too we think that a report as envisaged by the new clause would help the public to understand the impact of the top rate of tax so that they can make up their own minds about who is standing up for them and other working people like them ", "i beg to move that the clause be read a second time it is a pleasure to start the report stage of the finance bill mr speaker we had many good and long debates in the bill committee and i am sure we will continue that trend over the next couple of days the new clause which stands in my name and those of my right hon and hon friends would require the chancellor of the exchequer to publish within three months of the passing of this legislation a report on the additional rate of income tax the top rate which was 50p until last year when it was cut by this government to 45p the report we envisage would set out the impact on exchequer receipts of an additional rate set at 50p in the first year of the next parliament the chancellor would also be required to set out the impact of reducing the additional rate for last year 2013-14 and the amount of income tax paid by all additional rate payers those with incomes over \u00a3250 000 a year and those with incomes over \u00a31 million a year finally the report would set out the impact of the reduction in the additional rate in 2013-14 on the level of bonuses awarded in april 2013 to employees in the financial sector since the coalition budget of 2012 we have had a number of debates on the floor of the house and in public bill committee on the government\u2019s decision to cut the additional rate from 50p to 45p indeed the minister has referred to such debates being an annual event during the passage of the finance bill why is it so important that we continue to press the government on this one decision made in 2012 after they have refused to listen to all and any attempts to get them to change course it is because if there is one decision taken by the government that tells us all we need to know about their priorities and who they stand for this is it the government who said  we\u2019re all in it together and the chancellor who promised that he would not balance the books on the backs of the poor saw fit to give at a time when ordinary working people were seeing their living standards fall and when the combined impact of tax and benefits changes has left households on average more than \u00a3974 a year worse off an absolutely huge tax cut to the wealthiest in our country for millionaires this tax cut is worth an average of \u00a3100 000 a vast sum far out of reach for the majority of working people so although this may appear to be simply an annual event and part of the house\u2019s debates on the finance bill it is much more than that this government made a bad choice the wrong choice when they prioritised a tax cut for millionaires while ordinary working people continued to struggle as a result of their decisions and we will not let them forget it ", "i am pleased that the right hon gentleman is here i recall in the debate in committee of the whole house that he argued for a further cut in the rate to 40p citing in evidence the increase in revenues resulting from the cut but as he should know i am sure he does that is a result of bonuses being deferred i shall return to that point but i think it tells us all we know about where the government stand on fairness ", "my hon friend makes an excellent point we do indeed have a regular debate about the facts and figures i will come to the detailed data on the yield from the 50p rate later but if the government accepted our new clause much of that debate could be put to bed especially as her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs now has much more data with which to produce an analysis that is less flawed than the one in 2012 ", "i am grateful to my hon friend for that powerful point as i said i will explore the details in relation to data and the argument over the yield from the 50p rate but he is right we cannot continue to rely on a report produced when the rate had been in place for only one year the government should accept the new clause and produce a much more comprehensive analysis it was the labour government who introduced the 50p rate which came into effect in 2010-11 a decision made after the financial crisis as we sought to get the deficit down when this government came to power they did not say anything in the coalition agreement about abolishing the 50p rate but in 2011 the chancellor said that he would ask hmrc to look at the yields from the 50p rate which was the warning signal that he was looking to cut it in 2012 with hmrc\u2019s report  the exchequer effect of the 50 per cent additional rate of income tax to back him up the chancellor cut the rate to 45p why go through the process of looking at yield and getting hmrc to produce a report everyone knew that there were not enough data to come to an accurate view about yield because the rate had not been in place for long enough a point about which i shall say more later well the chancellor knew that he needed cover for that deeply ideological decision so he was desperate to claim that a 50p rate raised very little money if he could stand before the house and say that it raised hardly any money at all never mind the uncertainty and the incompleteness of the data he calculated that he could justify giving a tax cut to the richest in our country knowing that on his watch ordinary people those on middle and lower incomes would pay the price for his economic plan which has failed on the terms that he set for himself when he came to power in 2010 ", "i fear that on previous form the government will not listen today and accept our new clause nothing that has been said in previous debates gives me any confidence that they understand the message that they have sent to my hon friend\u2019s constituents mine and those of members across the house that a tax cut for the wealthiest is prioritised while ordinary working people at the lower end of the income scale are worse off ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point what do the government have to hide the data that we seek would not be difficult for hmrc to provide it has already conducted one analysis and it is not unfeasible for it to conduct a further analysis this time based on more comprehensive data which would clear up some of the issues once and for all ", "my hon friend makes a good contribution which i agree with ", "the right hon gentleman is wrong the government have published one set of figures from only one year\u2019s data much more data are now available for a further more comprehensive review to be carried out and the government should do so if they have nothing to hide and if they are confident that they have made the right decision they should submit that to scrutiny returning to data and yield from the 50p rate we know from the government\u2019s own assessment that the cost of cutting the rate from 50p to 45p was more than \u00a33 billion excluding all behavioural changes in treasury terms \u00a33 billion is a big deal so how could the tax cut be justified well the government say that most of that potential \u00a33 billion revenue would effectively be lost as a result of tax avoidance the so-called behavioural change effect having assessed revenue lost as a result of tax avoidance and other behavioural change the government go on to say that the cost to the exchequer of cutting the rate to 45p is only \u00a3100 million so on the government\u2019s figures an additional rate of tax set at 50p would raise only \u00a3100 million except that even the hmrc report acknowledges as does the institute for fiscal studies that all the analysis and estimates are highly uncertain the scale of behavioural change is primarily based on an assessment of taxable income elasticity this is the extent to which taxable income changes when the tax rate changes the ifs says that there is a margin of error staying within the margin of error one could easily say that depending on the taxable income elasticity cutting the rate could cost the exchequer \u00a3700 million or could raise \u00a3600 million that gives us an idea of the range of figures that we are talking about and how uncertain these projections are the government were and are well aware of this so we can conclude that the decision was political and ideological and was not rooted in certain and exact calculations and comprehensive data let me deal with the point about comprehensive data because uncertainty is not the only thing that was wrong with the government\u2019s analysis as i said in response to interventions the hmrc report was based on only one year\u2019s worth of data the data relating to 2010-11 which is a significant weakness in itself the report came too early given the history of the introduction of the rate and the government\u2019s decision to cut it the reliance on year 1 of the rate being in place further weakens the government\u2019s argument on the numbers because we know that incomes were taken earlier toavoid the 50p rate when it came into effect and as a result incomes in 2010 and 2011 were artificially lower suggesting a lower yield the government should at the very least update the analysis in the light of the more recent data for the years 2011-12 and 2012-13 because hmrc now has available to it records for the two years when the 50p rate was in place and it could update the report that was used for budget 2012 that would give a much clearer picture to all of us who are relying on other figures and forecasts the government say that the increased yield when the rate was cut to 45p is evidence that a lower rate of tax on that occasion resulted in a larger yield however they conveniently forget that just as people shifted income into 2009 and 2010 to avoid the 50p rate when it was introduced once the chancellor had said in his 2012 budget that he would abolish that rate the following year in 2013 people effectively decided to delay their bonuses and income until the new tax year 2013-14 in order to pay 45p rather than 50p that is why our new clause requires the government to consider the impact of the cut in the additional rate on the level of bonuses in particular we know that income forestalling and deferment both occurred and the government cannot ignore the deferment of bonuses when they seek to argue that they made the right decision and cite increased revenues in support of their argument ", "with the amount of uncollected tax rising the swiss deal raising less than a third of what the chancellor predicted and ministers refusing to close the eurobonds loophole is not the truth that the government are totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and to close the tax gap ", "while the minister fails to tackle tax avoidance overseas buyers are snapping up property in london but not making a proper tax contribution in this country is it not time that the government introduced a fair tax on properties worth more than \u00a32 million and used the money to cut taxes for 24 million working people with a lower 10p starting rate of income tax ", " further to that point of order mr caton i am sure that the minister was about to thank the officials clerks and whips who have served the committee so well i put on record my thanks to all members of the committee for how they have engaged with our debates on and scrutiny of the bill i thank the ministerial team for its courtesy and diligence in responding to our many points and questions and my front-bench colleagues for their contributions i thank mr streeter and you mr caton for chairing the committee and getting us through to the end we are most grateful ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman he makes an important point again it will be helpful to hear from the minister how the definition will play out in practice we know who the 20 high-risk promoters are any of us who go on the internet to look into such matters will quickly work out who those companies are we know who we are trying to get to as a result of these measures there is a question about whether those are the only promoters that the government are seeking to catch as a result of the measures or whether there is an intention to go further if we are going further that is a perfectly reasonable route to take given some of the examples of tax avoidance that have made it into the public domain and into public discourse in going down that road it would be helpful to know how the government\u2019s approach will be shaped and what more might be needed as the proposals and measures bed in there is no right of appeal to the issue of a conduct notice as i mentioned earlier we have already had some debate about other measures in this section of the bill that do not attract a right of appeal i simply reiterate the points i made earlier that rights of appeal are an important feature of our legal system if we are going to derogate from them and remove them as legislators we must be sure that there is no other way of crafting a right of appeal to guard against the opportunity in this example for some promoters unacceptably to delay the effectiveness of the high-risk promoters provisions by making multiple appeals perhaps the minister will address that point and satisfy the committee that in removing the right of appeal he was sure that there was no way of phrasing or crafting a right of appeal that \u00a0could guard against that opportunity for promoters to cause further and unacceptable delay much comment was made during the consultation process that tax avoidance grows as the complexity of tax law increases members of previous finance bill committees who have dealt with finance bills much longer than the one we have been scrutinising over the past few weeks will attest that even with an office of tax simplification the tax law that we pass feels like an ever-growing beast will the minister provide an update on the government\u2019s view on simplification of the tax code what more are they planning do the government recognise that there is an interplay between greater complexity of tax law and the way in which further avoidance activity appears to spring up like a many-headed hydra what steps will the government take to ensure that a firm clampdown on promoters will not simply drive their activities below the hmrc radar or offshore where they will be even harder to regulate has any assessment been made of that risk and is there more that can be done to try to prevent that similarly does the minister share the concern of the chartered institute of taxation that some high-risk promoters could wear the naming and shaming that is envisaged as a result of these measures as a badge of honour or worse as approval by hmrc that they provide schemes that work and that he is therefore potentially providing a valuable marketing tool for the most unscrupulous individuals it would be helpful to know what assessments have been made to measure that risk i return to a question on resourcing which has been a theme of all our debates today hmrc is getting more powers and therefore its resources are brought under sharper scrutiny given the wide-ranging information powers in the legislation is there a risk that hmrc might be inundated with a huge volume of material to the extent that they cannot cope especially as the information in these measures is not limited to just dotas cases let alone to just avoidance cases hmrc will presumably need to allocate more resources to dealing with this information has any analysis been done comparing the costs of using the current rules to go after the 20 known high-risk promoters as a targeted approach with that of the wider measures what is the required resource for the approach that has been adopted as a result of the legislation the hon members for dover for redcar and for daventry are right to point out that tax avoidance has been greatly discussed by ordinary members of the public it comes up as a doorstep issue especially given that some of the cases of the most aggressive tax avoidance adopted by people who are described as celebrities have filtered through the public consciousness and elevated the debate making it a higher political priority given the financial circumstances of the country it is ever more important that we ensure that we collect all the tax that is due in a timely way the government are right therefore to focus on what happens when tax avoidance occurs and who the people that engage in this behaviour are a necessary aspect of that debate is to think about sanctions and penalty regimes for promoters and people who engage in that activity however that would lead to a wider system of regulation to make the whole system work which raises further important questions about the way in which the professions operate \u00a0i know that the house of lords economic affairs committee has looked at those questions a number of times they are issues that we continue to receive representations on as i am sure the minister does they are important points to be considered given where we are with the public debate ", " the clauses in the group also fall under the stream of government consultations called  raising the stakes on tax avoidance which we discussed this morning and earlier this afternoon the clauses on follower notices and accelerated payments which we have just debated are also part of the strategy it is worth bearing in mind that a further measure has been proposed to give hmrc the power to directly collect debts from individuals\u2019 bank accounts it is not however part of the bill it is currently subject to a consultation and has been subject to a great deal of media scrutiny already as have the measures before us the aim of the clauses is to identify those promoters of tax avoidance schemes whose behaviour is deemed to be high risk once identified they will be issued with a conduct notice to encourage improved behaviour but if compliance is not forthcoming in a prescribed period a monitoring notice may be issued under the authority of the first-tier tribunal that will lead to further sanctions for the promoter including publication of that status by hmrc as well as additional information and compliance burdens according to the recent guidance hmrc expects monitoring notices to be issued in only a small number of cases in more detail clauses 227 to 229 deal with the definitions that will be applied to the terms  promoter  intermediary and so on clauses 230 to 234 and schedule 30 relate specifically to conduct notices the clauses introduce the concept of a conduct notice which may be issued if a promoter has triggered a threshold condition in the previous three years hmrc expects that in most circumstances there will be discussions \u00a0with a promoter that has met a threshold condition with the aim of understanding why it happened and reaching an agreement on appropriate standards for the future hmrc will aim to develop a working relationship with promoters that it hopes will lead to issues being resolved informally and without the need for the issue of a conduct notice insignificant breaches of certain threshold conditions may be ignored but certain threshold conditions would always lead to a conduct notice for example receiving a conduct notice as a dishonest tax agent unless hmrc deems a notice inappropriate due to the minimal impact on the level of collection of tax for example if the promoter fails to disclose a notifiable proposal under dotas and if that is significant but there are no users of the proposal it would not be appropriate to issue a conduct notice in contrast if the promoter omits 300 clients from a dotas client list that will probably have a significant impact on the collection of tax and so would be included the clauses set out what needs to be contained in a conduct notice such as the conditions that the recipient must comply with and also gives a recipient the opportunity to comment on the proposed terms significantly however there is no right of appeal and points have already been made in relation to that the clauses allow an authorised hmrc officer to withdraw the notice if there is evidence that the underlying reason for it has been addressed finally the clauses set the maximum length for a conduct notice at two years clauses 235 to 242 contain the procedures for monitoring notices where a promoter fails to comply with a conduct notice an authorised hmrc officer must apply to a tribunal to approve a monitoring notice only a tribunal may issue a monitoring notice and may refuse to do so the promoter must be made aware of the application to the tribunal the monitoring notice will state the reasons for its issue and in particular the condition in the conduct notice that the promoter has breached one effect of a monitoring notice is that the promoter may be subject to specific information notices with penalties for non-compliance the bill will allow the promoter to make a case to the tribunal that a monitoring notice is not appropriate for example because the original condition in the conduct notice was unreasonable and the tribunal may amend the proposed monitoring notice if it so wishes the proposed law also allows hmrc to publish details of promoters subject to a monitoring notice including the conditions in the conduct notice that were breached the promoter must inform its clients that it is being monitored and regulations may be added to require the promoter to include the fact that it is being monitored in marketing literature and on the web clauses 243 to 246 refer to promoter reference numbers once a monitoring notice takes effect hmrc will issue a promoter reference number to the relevant promoter who in turn will be required to pass on that number to all its clients that will enable hmrc to direct its compliance efforts towards those particular clients clauses 247 to 253 relate to information powers the clauses give hmrc wide-ranging powers to request information from monitored promoters on arrangements and proposals that they set up once a monitoring notice has been given clauses 254 to 259 give additional powers to enable an authorised hmrc officer to request information or documents that had not been provided in previous notices or where the officer suspects that the promoter has withheld particular information or documents there is a right of appeal by the promoter against these information notices clauses 260 to 266 set out the form and manner in which requests for information are to be made and provide some exemptions on producing certain documents clauses 267 to 273 and schedule 31 set out the penalties that may be levied for non-compliance with various aspects of the new rules they can be substantial up to about \u00a31 million the clauses also introduce a higher standard of reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the new regulations in particular an individual cannot rely on legal advice provided to them by a monitored promoter to claim that they have taken reasonable care with their tax affairs which could otherwise be used as an argument to mitigate a penalty clauses 274 to 276 provide supplemental technical provisions including the introduction of schedule 32 which extend the rules to partnerships we support the motives behind the new regulations however it would be useful to have some clarity on precisely what types of tax avoidance the government are prepared to allow to continue i say that because according to hmrc guidance the regime involves a graduated series of sanctions which carefully balances the rights of promoters against the need to prevent and defeat tax avoidance given our discussion and in particular the thrust of the amendments tabled by the hon member for dover my reading of that guidance is an apparent acceptance that the industry exists it would therefore be helpful to know where the minister draws the line on tax avoidance which behaviours would he deem to be acceptable and which must be stopped the hmrc guidance talks about a balancing of rights not the elimination of rights or of a particular type of activity further clarification on that would be helpful especially as the use of aggressive tax avoidance schemes is almost exclusively the preserve of wealthy individuals and corporates what consideration has the minister given to the argument that it is time for promoters of tax avoidance schemes to face the same fines as their clients when their schemes fail all too often promoters have already pocketed substantial fees from their attempts to deprive the public purse of much needed revenue perhaps more is needed to persuade them to pursue a career that to coin the phrase used by the hon member for dover is of  more societal value what is the government\u2019s view on taking such measures forward to what may be considered natural conclusions such as penalties and other sanctions that go beyond mere notices broadly speaking the minister will be well aware that the reaction from the accountancy firms and professional bodies to the initial consultation on high-risk promoters was negative but that adverse reaction appears to have softened somewhat as hmrc has now addressed some of the issues raised in the consultation process however concerns remain over particular clauses and a wider question is being raised about hmrc going to the trouble of getting the new clauses introduced to act against what appears to be a small number of promoters in doing so the professional bodies are concerned we \u00a0might think that they would say this that the clauses might catch legitimate activity it would therefore be useful to hear what activity the minister considers to be legitimate we know that about 20 businesses are potentially high-risk promoters that hmrc wants to target it would be helpful to have the minister\u2019s explanation of what consideration was given to its existing powers and whether they were sufficient to deal with those promoters each promoter will approach its work differently and have different levels of risk in its proposals we could argue that rather than a generic definition for all which might catch people that the government do not intend a more targeted approach using existing rules might be better it would be helpful for the minister to tell us how he has come to a different conclusion the committee needs to be satisfied that the action we are taking will catch all those whom it is intended to catch ", " thank you very much mr caton in our previous session i introduced my remarks to this set of proposals so i will not do so again however before i comment on the points raised during the debate this morning i want to look at the financial impact of the changes the impact notes for the provisions estimate that accelerated payment notices relating to existing avoidance cases currently in dispute will be issued to 33 000 taxpayers the revenue associated with the provisions is substantial her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs estimates the notices will result in receipts of \u00a3340 million this year \u00a31 3 billion in 2015-16 \u00a31 3 billion in 2016-17 \u00a3750 million in 2017-18 and \u00a3385 million in 2018-19 it is important to stress that this is not a new revenue stream the measures bring forward money hmrc expects to collect by several years the revenue expected to be raised by the extension of accelerated payments to cases covered by disclosure of tax avoidance schemes and by the general anti-abuse rule is significant particularly as no cases have been deemed to have breached the gaar yet will the minister explain how he has calculated those figures especially in terms of the interplay with the gaar it would be helpful if he could explain the methodology that was used we briefly discussed that point on second reading will he explain the details when he responds we know that hmrc has an 80% win rate for the cases it pursues to litigation which is an excellent rate to achieve and we all hope it remains intact however the win rate is different from the value of the claims that are won they are two different things will the minister tell the committee the average value of an hmrc win that would help the committee to interrogate the figures that were used in the costings how confident is the minister that the same success rate will apply to cases heard on the gaar since no cases have been heard under the rule yet our debate this morning was about retrospection and the concerns of members of the public who fear they will be caught by accelerated payment notices and of professional bodies the debate turned on whether the measures were retrospective the minister stated that because there is no change to underlying tax liability retrospection does not come into play however against that the committee heard the argument put forward by my hon friend the member for erith and thamesmead who pointed out that the measures impact on behaviour that cannot change because it has already occurred and therefore that retrospection and all associated issues were engaged i found the minister\u2019s explanation on retrospection and the argument he and hmrc put forward to be persuasive there is no indication of a new and unexpected tax liability if that was the case there would be no doubt that the measures are retrospective however i do not believe that is the case this feels much more like a situation where to borrow a concept from another aspect of our legal system the legitimate expectations of a taxpayer have been changed when that happens as it does in other aspects of our law particularly when \u00a0we discuss concepts of reasonableness in judicial reviews and other matters if legitimate expectations of taxpayers or others are changed that mischief the changing of legitimate expectations is remedied by the time-to-pay arrangements which should assist in righting any wrongs there is also the remedy of an interest payment on top of the tax that was in dispute if it is found that it needs to be paid back to the taxpayer if there is any unfairness as a result of the measures it can be remedied by those other measures ", " my hon friend makes an important point that has been made forcefully by the many members of the public who got in touch with members of the committee i would simply repeat a point made by the minister and others we have to look at the context in which the measures will take effect in the vast majority of cases people were aware or were made aware of what they needed to do in relation to dotas that brings into play the fact that the tax is in dispute a point made by the hon member for dover in his speech my construction of the measures before us leads me to believe that the measures are not retrospective but i acknowledge that the point is at the very least arguable many of the professional bodies who have looked at it closely and the law society have made strong and forceful representations that the measures are retrospective in effect i do not think it is possible for the committee to dismiss that ", " i agree with the hon gentleman that all taxpayers have a responsibility for the content of their tax return they are entitled to take advice many people who do not understand the complexity of a very complex tax legitimately take advice there is a point to be made about the reliance on advisers and remedies against advisers when things go wrong the committee should bear that in mind if people are ticking the box in relation to a dotas disclosure it is fair to say that they are on notice that things may change and they may have to pay the amount of tax levies in dispute ", " i was coming on to exactly that point i hope that once i have finished my remarks on retrospection the hon gentleman will understand where the official opposition are coming from i will happily take further interventions from him to clarify things if necessary as i was explaining my reading of the rules before us is that we are not talking about a retrospective measure in the normal way we understand retrospective measures however accepting that it is possible to plead the case in the alternative that the measure is retrospective due to its impact on behaviour that cannot now be changed taking on board the fact that many senior commentators and professional organisations have characterised the measures as retrospective and thinking about first principles my first point is that our legal system has well established principles of natural justice and procedural fairness which retrospection would by its nature offend therefore if we are to introduce retrospective measures we should do so only in exceptional circumstances that are tightly controlled and only when they deal with the mischief that we are trying to remedy and go no further that was certainly the thinking behind the previous labour government\u2019s introduction of one element of retrospection into the tax system which we discussed this morning that is certainly our approach now looking at the retrospection case as i said on an alternative basis i would say that there is still a strong case for the kind of action that we are discussing on that basis although the arguments about retrospection are important and it is right that such points are made i would say that the practical and philosophical points merge because the system as it stands is successfully gamed which results in increased costs for the taxpayer we all ultimately lose out when such delays occur in the system it is important that governments of all colours and persuasions take practical measures to sort out the practical problems with our system we have had some discussion about the fate of those who have made a dotas disclosure in order to be on the safe side they were some of the concerns raised by my hon friend the member for erith and thamesmead and members of the public i am grateful for the minister\u2019s clarification on how dotas disclosures work and why he does not think that those concerns are engaged but i remain concerned that there may be a reduced willingness to make dotas disclosures which would be unwelcome i took from the minister\u2019s remarks this morning that he is aware of that risk that is why we are going to get as i understand it a planned consultation on further strengthening of dotas when he responds i would be grateful if he could share any further detail on the matter with the committee i know that he will not be able to tell us totally what is coming up in the consultation but some further detail would be welcome particularly if we are responding to our constituents in relation to the argument about people doing things to be on the safe side and the behavioural change that might result in fewer dotas disclosures it would also be helpful for the minister to give us some further detail on the representations he has received regarding accelerated payment notices and whether he has received any examples of the so-called  on the safe side dotas disclosures again if we could have some detail of such circumstances it would be helpful for the committee particularly given the public\u2019s interest in that aspect of the clauses i agree with the minister that hmrc should not have its hands tied in enforcing powers on time to pay or pursuing bankruptcy notices against taxpayers who fail to pay due tax when the minister responds will he help the committee to understand better how hmrc currently uses its powers the number of cases and how many bankruptcy notices are pursued that would help the committee respond to constituents\u2019 concerns the minister touched on the following point but i did not catch all of his answer hmrc guidance states the allocation or notification of a scheme reference number does not indicate that hmrc accept that the scheme achieves or is capable of achieving any purported tax advantage will the minister explain what criteria alongside scheme reference numbers will be used by hmrc officials to assess whether an accelerated payment notice will be issued as i said he touched on those points but unfortunately i missed the beginning of his remarks the level of revenue associated with accelerated payments will depend on the amount payable the minister will be aware that many including the chartered institute of taxation are concerned about the proposed method for establishing the payable amount that lies solely with hmrc hmrc has said that it will issue a payment notice to the best of the designated hmrc officers\u2019 information and belief i would like clarification of what that might mean in practice will the minister give a more detailed account of how the amount of an accelerated payment notice will be calculated on a more technical point will the minister tell us what will happen when there is an overlap between follower cases particularly where a follower case is withdrawn and the dotas scheme how will hmrc deal with that clarification is needed on the withdrawal of accelerated payment notices following the withdrawal of a follower notice clause 220(3) obliges hmrc to withdraw an accelerated payment notice where the follower notice to which it relates is withdrawn in contrast clause 220(2)(a) gives hmrc the authority to withdraw an accelerated payment notice but the term  withdraw is used only in connection with follower notices in the context of the alternative outcomes following hmrc\u2019s consideration of a taxpayer\u2019s representations against a follower notice will the minister clarify whether that means that hmrc is obliged to withdraw an accelerated payment notice only where the related follower notice is withdrawn as a consequence of its consideration of the taxpayer\u2019s representations if that is not the case will the minister indicate in what other circumstances a follower notice would be withdrawn within the meaning of clause 220(3) should taxpayers wish to dispute the accelerated payment notice according to the clauses before us they will be able to make representations to hmrc will \u00a0hmrc publish guidance on that the minister will be aware that the ciot has already suggested that the guidance should comprise four things first it should explain in what form representations should be made secondly explain the procedure that will be used to consider the representations thirdly explain what factors it will take into account when making decisions and fourthly provide an indication of how long it will take to make its decision i would welcome the minister\u2019s comments on that ciot suggestion as well as further details of when guidance will be published it is understandable that once an accelerated payment notice has been issued hmrc would wish to collect the amount in dispute in a timely manner clause 219 seeks to encourage such behaviour by imposing a penalty where an accelerated payment is not made in accordance with the issued notice the penalty structure looks very similar to that applying to the late payment of tax under the self-assessment regime however the significant difference is that the latter imposes 5% penalties after 30 days six months and 12 months of the due date of the payment of tax as a result penalties associated with accelerated payment notices are incurred 30 days earlier than they would be under self-assessment and consequently a taxpayer who has received an accelerated payment notice at the same time as a follower notice would have a 90-day period in which to consider whether to make representations against either and contact hmrc to negotiate a time to pay arrangement i would like to ask the minister if there is a danger that such a system creates an incentive to make representations against an accelerated payment notice potentially creating unnecessary work for hmrc has any assessment has been made of that did he consider whether aligning the accelerated payment notice penalty dates with the normal self-assessment penalty dates could work better and to the mutual advantage of hmrc and taxpayers we discussed hmrc resourcing earlier today and as with follower notices this measure is expected to have substantial hmrc resource implications as a large number of people begin a range of different legal challenges potentially including judicial review proceedings an increase in closure applications through the tribunal and disputed enforcement activity the impact note states that flexible legal resource options are being considered to meet the expected demands of this work and that the government will ensure that departments have the necessary resources to deliver this key policy successfully the minister mentioned 800 new staff i would be grateful for clarification about whether those are new recruits or people being deployed from other parts of hmrc how far advanced is the process in terms of ensuring that new staff are ready to start dealing with apn cases as soon as the legislation becomes law ", " we have had an interesting debate as we have been hearing the legislation underpins the government\u2019s belief that during litigation and investigations into avoidance disputed tax should sit with the exchequer rather than as is currently the case with the taxpayer under existing rules taxpayers are able to include the tax advantage in their initial self-assessment and thereby reduce their liability the measures have given rise to a lot of comment from stakeholders members of the public outside the house we have heard references to the vigorous campaign being waged on social media we have all been getting messages in our timelines even as the debate has continued so many people are listening to what is being said today i hope that they feel that the issues are being thoroughly ventilated ", " will those independent individuals reviewing the decision about the follower notice be from within the same team of hmrc officials that look at these cases or will they be from a different team ", " i am grateful for that intervention because i was going to put that question to the minister it would be good to know how many of the 65 000 marketed schemes hmrc expects to fall within the number of known marketed schemes causing the real mischief behind the backlog so that we know how many we can hopefully strike out quickly and start collecting tax that ought to have already been collected hmrc i think in relation to the objections raised by the law society argued that ftt decisions ought to be used when it comes to deciding whether a follower notice can be applied because if they were unavailable if a follower notice could be applied only to a higher court decision taxpayers might not appeal unfavourable decisions in order to avoid setting a precedent that would give rise to follower notices the law society said that it was not convinced by that argument and felt that it would require an unusual degree of altruism toward other taxpayers on behalf of the litigant choosing not to appeal something it believes is  rarely seen in practice i am sure that many stakeholders have been speaking to the minister and his officials at length about this aspect of the measures i would be grateful if he explained how the government arrived at the position of allowing ftt decisions to be included and if there might be some scope for looking at whether the system needs additional safeguards for example the chartered institute of taxation suggests that at the end of a lead case it might be appropriate to ask a judge to make a declaration that the case is apt for follower notices to be issued that might provide an opportunity for the judge briefly to state the points of law and fact that helped them arrive at that decision so as to remove uncertainty when that case is used as the basis for follower notices in other cases it would be helpful to know if the minister considered alternative methods of bringing greater clarity to the regime as envisaged by the legislation and why the \u00a0government seem to be coming down in favour of hmrc assessment of a judgment do the government think it is worth considering perhaps once we have seen how the measures work out in practice whether there is scope for such a declaration to be made by a judge so that there is less debate about the facts and features of a scheme that led a judge to make that decision that might also assist with the change we envisage in our system to allow the lower tribunal to set a precedent ", " yes i have no different analysis of or principled objection to that it will be helpful if the minister can give us a feel for how many of the 65 000 will fall into this cookie-cutter type case we would assume for example that the 289 cases within the eclipse 35 scheme would all be exactly the same we all know that there are always cases in the legal system where there are some differential elements and we need to ensure that our rules are robust enough to deal with the many and varied facts that are adjudicated upon by our tribunals day in day out in the normal run of things we would think there would not be any issues but if we are going to change the law we need to ensure that we allow for the odd cases that sit outside the cookie-cutter type or those where the cutter has gone wrong and the cookie has come out a slightly different shape those are the cases that we need to worry about and ensure that the rules are robust enough to deal with another main concern is the lack of a right of appeal when a follower notice is issued many of the concerns expressed by stakeholders as well as by members of the public relate to the fact that they feel it represents an erosion of a taxpayer\u2019s access to justice getting the balance right between ensuring that we are able to clear backlogs thereby saving taxpayers lots of money and collect tax that is due and ensuring that the justice system is fair is tricky it is important and necessary that if we are going to make these changes i have no objection in principle to the rules of appeals and follower notices and take away rights of appeal we must ensure that we have really stress-tested the case for doing so and ensured that the new arrangements are well understood and people know exactly what they are dealing with the association of taxation technicians has raised deep concerns about the lack of any right of appeal against the follower notices it says that the result is that a taxpayer who wishes to pursue negotiation or litigation with hmrc must accept the likelihood of the imposition of a substantial penalty even if they are prepared to pay on account the full amount of the disputed tax it feels that that involves a unique and disturbing tipping of the scales in favour of the executive beyond the extent required to address the targeted mischief even if a person is prepared to pay up front the amount of tax that is in dispute they are still liable for penalty and their rights of appeal are still affected the legislation means that if a taxpayer is not prepared to abandon their entitlement or negotiate or litigate with hmrc in respect of the effectiveness or otherwise of the adoptive arrangements they are at risk of the penalty all that the taxpayer can do is notify hmrc that they dispute its conclusion and wait for hmrc to either withdraw or confirm the notice while it may be possible in theory to pursue judicial review which is fast becoming the first and last resort for many people under the changes to our justice system over the last few years and is of course an expensive procedure there is no direct appeal to an independent court of tribunal in relation to either the follower notice or the accelerated payment notices scheme which we will discuss later the law society says this equates to the imposition of a substantial contingent cost for access to justice and that it should only be created if there is absolutely no credible alternative will the minister establish that there was no credible alternative and the rules that we have ended up with in the bill are the only formulation that could be adopted in order to relieve us of the severe problem of the backlog of the cases will he tell us what advice he took on the lack of a right of appeal and how the penalties will operate what discussions did he have with colleagues was some of the thinking around bureaucracy and further delays to the system if appeal rights were put back into the legislation was any assessment made of what further delays might be caused if the follower notices legislation went forward but included some limited right of appeal were different types of appeal processes considered and rejected it would be helpful to have more detail the last concern is around hmrc resourcing it is clear that the new arrangements will place a significant burden on hmrc at a time when existing resources are being spread ever thinner the association of revenue and customs believes that hmrc is facing a demographic time bomb more than half its work force is aged over 45 with 18% over 55 that proportion is higher at senior level where around 30% of grade 6 employees are over 55 will the minister inform us at which grade the decisions about issuing follower notices will be taken so that we can establish that they will taken by appropriately senior individuals with the requisite amount of experience and get an idea of whether they are all people who are likely to retire soon the minister and i have often discussed hmrc resourcing and retirement figures i have often tabled parliamentary questions that the minister has not been able to answer because there is no set retirement age in hmrc i understand that but in terms of how these measures are implemented it would be helpful to know the numbers of staff who will make the decisions about the imposition of a follower notice and are also coming up to retirement if it is likely that many of those staff will soon retire it would be helpful to know the contingency planning in hmrc to ensure that they are replaced by people with appropriate experience so that there is no gap in how the scheme is enacted is the minister confident that ensuring seniority of decision makers on follower notices will not mean that other aspects of hmrc work face a detrimental transfer of expertise are we in danger of seeing exceptional performance of the team that deals with follower notices but a decrease in performance in another team because people have been transferred it would be helpful to have some detail about how that will work at hmrc in practice the operational detail on how hmrc will handle the new regime was highlighted by the chartered institute of taxation in its response to the consultation it said that the key point that needs to be addressed is that if there is a transfer of power from the legislature to the executive the efficient and fair function of the executive becomes critical its concern and that of the vast majority of respondents to the consultation relates to the practical operation including an understanding of seniority of staff hmrc will effectively be operating a chinese wall where the decision about issuing a follower notice will be taken by a senior official wholly removed from the team that was dealing with the case up to the point at which a decision had to be made about a follower notice many barristers\u2019 chambers and solicitors\u2019 firms often have people in them acting for both sides it is not unusual to see a chinese wall in our legal system however if so much power is to be vested at executive level it is important that the arrangements have the confidence of the public who will be issued with the notices and of the stakeholders who will act for those parties it would be good to get an understanding of how robust the procedures within hmrc will be many stakeholders have asked for a clear official explanation of the internal governance processes will the minister address that suggestion in his comments to the committee and his work with stakeholder groups after the bill passes will hmrc issue comprehensive guidance to outline which situations will be tackled by the new legislation has consideration been given to what might be included in such guidance if guidance will be issued will the minister give us an idea of the time scale he has in mind for publishing it finally many people have asked for a formal review of the measures and how they will operate not only in hmrc but in the courts and the tribunal service the government response to the consultation used the usual formulation and said that they keep taxation measures under regular review however i felt that it held out the possibility that hmrc recognises that the new rules are radical and remove substantial rights from taxpayers to deal with a real problem i wonder whether that is a hint that the review will say something more than that they will keep everything under review and that hmrc is looking at how the measures will be implemented i want to get an idea from the minister about whether that is wishful thinking on the part of those who want a review or whether something is going on ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his comments he is right the thrust of the measures that we support deals with the latter example that he gave cases in which the same scheme has been marketed and used in exactly the same way in each case but there will be some differences the question is looking at ftt decisions whether there will be enough in that ruling to be able to work out what the similarities are often legal argument does not necessarily turn just on the features of one marketed tax avoidance scheme there may be other elements to a case which might be lost that is why i am putting that point to the minister there is a principle of law and of the way our legal system works which relates to what type of decisions have the ability to set a precedent that has to be followed in all cases thereafter a good feature of the measures is that there is a small number of boutique practices that put together marketed tax avoidance schemes which are almost exactly the same in nature all the time that is what we are trying to tackle ", " no i am merely testing the government\u2019s case to ensure that the rules that end up on the statute book are as robust as possible in principle i have no objection to an ftt decision being capable of setting a precedent for all cases thereafter but i would not be doing my job if i did not press the minister as hard as possible given the concerns expressed particularly by the law society if we are going to change fundamental principles of the english legal system and the way it functions whether taking away rights of appeal potentially introducing retrospection which i am sure we will discuss in greater detail in the next group or changing the basis on which precedents are set as legislators it is our duty to ask as many questions as possible to ensure that we know the scope of what we are trying to achieve so that the people who watch the debate understand exactly what they are dealing with and know that we do not make the decisions lightly or easily ", " that is exactly why i explained the level of seniority and the long experience that those making decisions at ftt level have i am making no comment about the value of their judgments i am \u00a0merely saying that as a long-standing principle of our legal system lower courts are often not capable in a personal injury claim the average county court does not set a precedent that is followed that is normally set by higher courts that is just how our legal system works and a similar principle is applied in this case i have no objection to departing from that because i recognise that a backlog of 65 000 cases with potentially billions of pounds of uncollected tax is no good for anybody we need to think of practical ways to deal with that problem but before departing from fundamental principles of our legal system we should test them to ensure that we know what we are doing and that we are doing the right thing ", " thank you mr streeter it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship you are right in saying that we are coming to the end of our consideration of the bill in committee part 4 of the bill is made up of four chapters all of which cover various tax avoidance measures chapter 1 provides an overview of part 4 and outlines some of the main definitions chapter 2 introduces a new obligation on users of an avoidance scheme that her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs has defeated at a tribunal or court hearing in another party\u2019s litigation to concede their position to reflect that decision that obligation will take the form of a follower notice and is the subject matter of this first group of proposals chapter 3 makes provision for issuing accelerated payment notices on the same grounds as follower notices but in addition to the cases disclosed under the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes dotas or those cases in which hmrc is taking counteraction under the general anti-abuse rule which is known as the gaar finally as we will discuss later chapter 4 makes special provision covering the application of part 4 to stamp duty land tax and annual tax for unfit dwellings in addition to conferring a power to extend the provisions of this part to other taxes and making consequential arrangements as the minister and the committee will be aware the measures have been subject to much comment and i look forward to exploring them in more detail during our final day in committee on clauses 197 to 211 the opposition support measures to tackle tax avoidance it is important that everyone plays their part and pays their fair share of tax these measures are the result of backlogs in the current system and the feeling that it is easy at the moment to game the system and to extend the time for resolution of a case which is in the interests of the party that has sought to engage in tax avoidance but less in the interests of ordinary taxpayers who end up paying more overall as hmrc takes longer to resolve cases this chapter in the bill falls under the government\u2019s broader consultation  raising the stakes on tax avoidance follower notices were subject to consultation from 12 august to 4 october 2013 they focus on encouraging users of avoidance schemes to settle their tax affairs after similar cases have been lost in court as the consultation document outlines buyers of tax avoidance schemes will submit their returns to hmrc on the assumption that the schemes will reduce their tax liability when a tax avoidance scheme is mass marketed as they often are hmrc is presented with a large number of returns based on the same assumption that the scheme will have reduced the person\u2019s tax liability in a particular way when hmrc holds that the scheme does not work it follows that it will argue that any returns based on that scheme are incorrect when faced with a large number of similar cases it is sometimes more efficient for hmrc to investigate representative cases taking them to litigation if necessary however when hmrc wins a representative case in the courts other taxpayers who have used the same or similar schemes sometimes see little incentive in settling their cases with hmrc when hmrc pursues litigation in similar cases tribunal rules allow for them to be heard together in certain circumstances but unfortunately that applies only to cases that have been notified to the tribunal to get to that stage hmrc has to investigate those cases to litigation standard and then close the tax inquiry that uses up the tribunal\u2019s resources places a strain on hmrc\u2019s compliance resources and often delays the collection of the correct tax in his autumn statement last year the chancellor of the exchequer announced we are introducing a new limited power that requires people to pay their taxes up front where the scheme they used has already been struck down by the courts [official report 5 december 2013 vol 571 c 1107 ]that measure will introduce a new obligation for users of an avoidance scheme that hmrc has defeated in a tribunal or court hearing in another party\u2019s litigation to concede their position to reflect that decision earlier this year on 24 january the government published a further consultation document  tackling marketed tax avoidance the consultation closed exactly \u00a0a month later on 24 february 2014 the consultation received more than 100 responses more than half of which came from one website however concerns were expressed by several stakeholders and members of the public who will be affected by the measures that the consultation period was insufficient for many of them particularly the accounting organisations the consultation took place at their busiest time of the year and therefore contained their ability they say to take part fully in the consultation process and to respond as they would have liked in its response to the consultation the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales said that there was so little time for comment that one month is not long enough given their length complexity and contentious nature i am sure the minister will tell us that a total of 800 responses received suggests that the length of time given for the consultation was sufficient but i am a little concerned that so many key stakeholders were upset about the length of time for consultation and said that it did not give them enough time to discuss with their members in detail the measures before us today they fear that they may have missed opportunities to improve the legislation not necessarily the principles behind what the government are trying to achieve but some of the more technical aspects of how those ends will be achieved when the minister responds i would be grateful if he explained to the committee the thinking behind the length of consultation period adopted by the government is he concerned that the short consultation period might mean that there was insufficient opportunity for hmrc and the stakeholders it regularly works with to build confidence about the impact of the measures and how they will be implemented when the bill is passed the consultation document outlined follower notices and the expansion of the accelerated payment notice scheme which the committee will discuss later today the main concerns discussed in the summary of responses document focus on the absence of a right of appeal the implications for the hmrc\u2019s resources and the processes that will be adopted internally as it takes important decisions on whether to apply a follower notice to a tax inquiry we must recognise the challenge facing hmrc because of the number of cases it is estimated that there are around 65 000 open cases involving marketed tax avoidance schemes representing potentially billions of pounds of uncollected taxes we all want to ensure that tax due is collected as quickly as possible however the process of collection and litigation that is currently undertaken by hmrc can take several years to complete there is a sense that it is quite easy to game the system and for individuals challenging the decisions of hmrc at the tribunal stage to cause delay opposition members therefore support the principle of follower notices as a practical measure that should hopefully decrease the amount of time it takes to settle those matters and ensure that the currently uncollected tax is collected quickly the responses to the consultation from many of the membership bodies show support in principle for the idea of follower notices when cases are the same or very similar in recognition of the need to deal with the many tens of thousands of outstanding mass-marketed avoidance schemes the stakeholders accept that the position is untenable and is causing great strain on hmrc and the \u00a0tribunal system however those same stakeholders have serious concerns that dealing with this backlog with follower notices risks taking away a taxpayer\u2019s normal safeguards and rights of appeal they are also concerned that the measure risks shifting a considerable amount of power from the legislature and the judiciary straight back to the executive meaning in this case hmrc officials one of the biggest concerns about the balance of power relates to the removal of a right of appeal much more will depend on officials at hmrc making decisions about whether a follower notice should be applied some stakeholders have described that as putting the taxpayer at the mercy of the bureaucrat given that there is no right of appeal stakeholders fear that far too much of power is concentrated in hmrc and they are not confident that hmrc can be relied on always to get it right many members of the public have commented that because the new powers sit within hmrc hmrc is becoming judge jury and executioner there is therefore a fair amount of concern about how the balance of power will sit in relation to such decisions the minister will be aware of the reaction of members of the public who may now get follower notices and it will be interesting to know how much confidence he has in the system overall and its robustness to deal with the lack of confidence that has been expressed so far another issue concerns the fact that tribunal group rulings from the first-tier tribunal can act as the basis for follower notices therefore the clauses within the chapter make the provision for hmrc to issue a follower notice on the basis of a judicial ruling that hmrc deems to be relevant to the taxpayer\u2019s chosen arrangements the definition of judicial ruling appears to include first-tier tribunals first-tier tribunal members are judges and deputy judges drawn from the former special commissioners the former vat and duties tribunal chairmen assignees from other tribunals and non-legal recruits who are selected by open competition possibly including ex-general commissioners in most cases the decisions of the first-tier tribunal are made by a judge and two other members although this can vary between chambers and sections and sometimes depends on the nature of the case there is no issue about the robustness of the ftt in and of itself but the use of ftt rulings as the basis for follower notices has been met with considerable opposition throughout the consultation process as the law society observes it is rare in our legal system for decisions of the lower tribunals to be used in that way because they have no precedential value in the normal run of things ftt decisions are not capable of setting a legal precedent that then has to be followed in all other cases that flow is the minister satisfied that the use of ftt decisions is satisfactory from a legal point of view what conversations has he had with the law officers and his colleagues in the ministry of justice about that slight change to the way in which lower tribunal decisions are treated within our legal system it can be difficult enough when a tax-related or a non-tax-related case gets to the upper tribunals to work out the exact basis for the decision that the lower tribunal judges made often lawyers i confess i was one in my pre-political life will spend many hours and earn a lot of money trying to work out the whether the comments of a judge are the rationale for the decision and whether the comments go to the heart of a decision or are obiter dicta ", " the clause does four things first the threshold for a zero rate of inheritance tax which is frozen at \u00a3325 000 is extended until 2017-18 secondly it enables borrowed funds in a foreign currency bank account to be treated in a similar way to how excluded properties property overseas where the person beneficially entitled to that property is non-uk domiciled is treated filing and payments dates for inheritance tax trust charges will be aligned as a result of the clause trustees of property settlements must now file and pay the tax due six months after the end of the month when the chargeable event happened the measure also introduces a new provision to treat income arising in relevant property trusts that remain undistributed for more than five years as part of the trust capital when calculating the 10-year anniversary charges that aspect of the measure has raised the most comment in particular from taxation specialists changes made to the treatment of trusts in finance act 2006 brought in a new relevant property regime apart from a few exceptions all settled property including assets such as money shares houses or land in most kinds of trusts will be relevant property in addition to the inheritance tax payable when assets are transferred into them trusts containing relevant property pay inheritance tax when assets are transferred out of the trust which is the exit charge the trust reaches a 10-year anniversary of when it was set up which is the periodic charge and the trust comes to an end hmrc has always taken the view that income retained for too long should not receive that special treatment but it has been difficult to determine a legal basis for how long is too long the clause attempts to do that by introducing a deemed rule retained income will be deemed to be capital if it has been held for more than five years it is important to note a number of things first time before 6 april 2014 will be counted so any income already held could be subject to charge immediately for example if there were a 10-year anniversary on 7 april 2014 secondly the deeming rule will apply only for inheritance tax purposes the income will still be income for all other tax purposes in particular income tax thirdly deeming rules will apply only for the purposes of 10-yearly charges and not exit charges meaning that trustees distributing the income will need to consider only the income tax issue and not potential inheritance tax issues at the same time fourthly when a rule applies at a 10-yearly anniversary the income will be deemed to have been capped for the whole of the previous 10 years as i said both the chartered institute of taxation and the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales have concerns about that aspect of the measures introduced by the clause both organisations agree that from their perspective it seems to be change for the sake of change indeed the ciot goes further saying that it feels that it has much more to do with raising revenue than with tax simplification although i note that the tax information impact note states that the measure is expected to have negligible impact on the exchequer given those concerns about the changes to the 10-year anniversary charge it would be helpful if the minister in his comments on the clause could outline in detail what problem he is trying to solve what did he have in mind when the clause was introduced that might allay the concerns of the ciot and the icaew it would also be helpful if he could explain to the committee whether he shares the icaew\u2019s concerns that trustees might now be forced to decide about distributing trust income on the basis of an impending tax charge rather than the needs of the beneficiaries a little more broadly there are also concerns that the measure is creating a further mismatch between trust law and tax law it would be helpful to have the minister\u2019s comments on the present slight differences in treatment between trust law and tax law measures and whether he has any intention of making those more uniform ", " clause 106 is being introduced as a result of a court of appeal judgment handed down on 26 june 2013 in the case of the pollen estate trustee company ltd and king\u2019s college london v hmrc the substance of that judgment was that when a charity purchases property jointly with a non-charity purchaser relief from sdlt under paragraph 1 of schedule 8 to the finance act 2003 is available on the charity\u2019s share of the property relief is subject to a test based on the extent to which the charity\u2019s share is used for charitable purposes in the light of that judgment hmrc has invited claims for any overpaid sdlt from charities that purchased property jointly with a non-charity purchaser and that satisfied the relevant conditions but did not claim the relief relief is limited to circumstances where the charity used the greater part of its share of the property for a charitable purpose where hmrc has opened an inquiry into the relevant land transaction return it has been in touch with the charities concerned we are told that the measure is expected to have a negligible impact on the exchequer and the impact note estimates that fewer than 100 charities a year will be affected by the change and that the compliance costs to the charities are expected to be minimal i would be grateful if the minister could confirm that also can he tell us how many charities since the court of appeal \u00a0judgment have claimed the overpayment of stamp duty land tax the value of those claims and whether he is confident that there has been no exploitation of the relief available for the avoidance of sdlt ", " the hon gentleman will be aware that we supported the ated changes that were introduced in the previous finance act and will support \u00a0today\u2019s measures the measures relate to envelope dwellings and we have a separate policy on residential property our support for a mansion tax which we would use to fund the reintroduction of the 10p rate which we have discussed at length previously in committee i fear that i would get into trouble if i went beyond the scope of the clauses in this group ", " i fear that the hon gentleman is trying to draw me into a much wider discussion about property taxation which takes us beyond envelope dwellings and properties owned through corporate structures of the type that we are discussing i am happy to have a separate debate with him at another time about residential property taxation but he is asking me to go beyond the subject matter of the clauses on the valuation of property the icaew expects more people to be dependent on the pre-return banding check as the owners of lower-value properties will not want to pay for a royal institution of chartered surveyors valuation it says that that means that hmrc will need to additional resources for those valuations and for compliance when the minister responds will he explain whether those additional resources are available and how much the cost will be in addition the impact note states processing additional ated returns will require it systems changes and additional staff resource as earlier i would like further details about the amount of additional resources that will be needed for both the cost of it systems changes and the additional staff how big are staffing resources at the moment and how much are they expected to increase by ", " clause 102 changes an interpretation of eu vat rules on prompt payment discounts that hmrc and its predecessor have adopted since the inception of those rules a prompt payment discount is exactly as it sounds it is a discount given by a supplier for prompt payment normally within 30 days hmrc\u2019s current interpretation of the uk legislation allows suppliers to account for vat on the discounted price even if prompt payment is not made and no discount is given for example if a customer buys goods that are priced at \u00a31 000 and is told that if they pay within 30 days they will get a discount of 2 5% and pay \u00a3975 the supplier can subsequently account for vat on \u00a3975 even if the prompt payment discount was not used and the customer paid \u00a31 000 after the change has been made hmrc will require vat to be accounted for on the amount that was actually received to bring the system into line with eu legislation hmrc has suggested that legal developments have forced it to change its view about the requirements of the european legislation i have not been able to tell whether the change is motivated by tax losses arising from the current interpretation of the rules according to the tax information and impact note the measure is not expected to have an exchequer impact i would be grateful if the minister could explain the thinking behind the change and why it was felt necessary to change the treatment of existing prompt payment discount rules the chartered institute of taxation has expressed a concern that the change is being made in haste the institute believes that no change in the treatment of the rules on prompt payment discounts should be made until the european court of justice rules that such treatment is not in accordance with eu vat law i would be grateful if the minister would comment on the concerns raised by the ciot and other stakeholders that point goes back to the thinking behind why the government chose to make this change now rather than wait for case law to that effect the change being made is significant the impact note states that up to 250 000 businesses may be affected that the cost of the change will be about \u00a38 million and that ongoing costs will be about \u00a33 5 million per annum will the minister tell us how the change will be publicised to affected businesses and will he clarify when the proposed consultation will be carried out ", " with your permission mr streeter i would like to include clause 105 stand part in this group ", " thank you clauses 103 and 104 extend the annual tax on enveloped dwellings known as ated from 1 april 2015 properties held in corporate structures worth more than \u00a31 million and up to \u00a32 million will be subject to a charge of \u00a37 000 per year from april the following year the tax will be extended further and properties worth more than \u00a3500 000 and up to \u00a31 million will be subject to a charge of \u00a33 500 per year clause 105 reduces the threshold at which non-natural persons usually a company or partnerships with a corporate member or an investment scheme have to start paying 15% stamp duty land tax from \u00a32 million to \u00a3500 000 to provide some background ated was introduced in the finance act 2013 and came into effect on 1 april that year it is paid by companies or partnerships with corporate and collective investment schemes that own interests in uk residential property valued at more than \u00a32 million most residential properties are owned directly by individuals but in some cases they may be owned by a company a partnership with a corporate member or another collective investment vehicle in those circumstances the dwelling is said to be enveloped because the ownership sits within a corporate wrapper or envelope ated is an annual tax and is charged in respect of chargeable periods running from 1 april to 31 march the amount of tax charged is based on the value of the property on 1 april 2012 the property is revalued on 1 april every five years the chancellor announced the reduction in the ated threshold from \u00a32 million to \u00a3500 000 which will be introduced over two years in future years the charges will be indexed in line with the previous september\u2019s consumer prices index several reliefs are available that might result in exemption from ated an ated return has to be sent to hmrc in order to claim the relief there are several ways in which ated relief may apply to a dwelling including when it is let to a third party on a commercial basis and is not at any time occupied or available for occupation by anyone connected to the owner or when it is open to the public for at least 28 days per year if part of a property is occupied as a dwelling in connection with running the property as a commercial business open to the public the whole property is treated as one dwelling and any relief will therefore apply to the whole property the background to clause 105 is that schedule 4a to the finance act 2003 provides for a higher rate sdlt charge of 15% for acquisitions of a higher threshold interest by a non-natural person a higher threshold interest is an interest in a single dwelling of more than \u00a32 million or one of a number of interests in a single dwelling acquired in linked transactions where the aggregate charge exceeds \u00a32 million clause 105 will amend the 2003 act to reduce the threshold to \u00a3500 000 there are some exclusions from the higher rate namely acquisitions by trustees for the purposes of letting trading or redevelopment trades involving a dwelling being made available to the public and providing dwellings for occupation by certain employees or for use as a farmhouse the measures are expected to raise \u00a3365 million over the next five years and it has been estimated that approximately 12 000 individuals will be indirectly affected through their interests in nnps that purchase uk residential property such as companies and collective investment schemes the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales has raised some concerns about the treatment of nnps envisaged in the clause it states that many more nnps will now be brought within the scope of ated but that many will also qualify for an exemption such companies will have to file a return in order to claim the relief which the icaew fears will be a significant compliance burden it cites the example of landlords who often use a company to own commercially let residential property and who will be exempt from the charge but will still but will still have to report annually will the minister comment on those concerns and on what efforts are being made to ensure that the burden is minimised and that all nnps particularly such landlords will be made aware of how to comply with the new rules the measures include no graduation in charges about which the icaew is particularly concerned a property worth \u00a3500 000 incurs no charge while a property worth \u00a3500 001 will incur a charge of \u00a33 500 has the minister received any representations about graduating the sums that apply to properties of different values why did he decide to go with the current ated system within hmrc there are also no transitional provisions to allow a company to de-envelope a property without incurring excessive tax charges many stakeholders are concerned about the lack of transitional provisions and it would be helpful to learn whether the minister considered such provisions and why he decided not to go ahead with them ", " clause 101 will add health education england and the health research authority to a scheme under the value added tax act 1994 through which vat may be recovered the scheme in the 1994 act ensured that what would otherwise be irrecoverable vat does not dissuade government departments and nhs bodies from contracting out activities if that would otherwise result in efficiencies of scale the bodies that are the subject of clause 101 will replace two nhs bodies that are already entitled to recover vat the bodies have been established as non-departmental public bodies in the care act 2014 has the minister made an assessment of vat recovery arrangements for government departments and the economies of scale that are achieved such arrangements enable contracting-out activities vat recoverability often \u00a0comes up with regard to other aspects of public sector work i have debated vat recoverability and university research with the minister before and i would be

present bte supplies are taxed where the supplier is based the changes will mean that from 1 january 2015 the place of taxation will be where the customer is based that significant change requires suppliers to keep track of additional information about the countries in which vat will be due to save suppliers from having to register for vat in every single eu member state a vat mini one-stop shop online service has been established which will allow the eu supplier of e-services to elect to register with the vat authority of their country of identification and file a single vat return detailing the supplies made to consumers in other member states and to pay the tax in a single payment to the state of identification that is an extension of the scheme that was introduced for non-eu businesses in 2003 to file a single vat return in the member state of identification and to submit a single vat return accounting for all vat in all member states of consumption the tax authority in the state of identification will be responsible for redistributing the vat to the member state of the customer which should relieve businesses of the burden of filing multiple vat registrations and making multiple payments the system will go live on 1 january 2015 but suppliers can register to use it from october 2014 eu businesses can register to use the union vat moss online service in the member state in which the business establishment is based which is usually the principal place of business or head office the vat moss online service is the collective name for two schemes i have mentioned the union scheme but there is also a non-union scheme for suppliers that are not established in the eu they can register in the member state of their choosing to account for the vat on all their bte supplies within the eu on one moss vat return there is a useful example on the hmrc website that shows what happens if someone registers for the vat moss online service in the uk people will be able to account for the vat due on all their business-to-consumer bte sales in any member state by submitting a single vat moss return and any related payment to hmrc hmrc will then send an electronic copy of the appropriate part of the vat moss return and the related vat payment to each relevant member state\u2019s tax authority \u00a0on their behalf the vat rate used will be that of each member state of consumption at the time the service was supplied the hmrc website also helpfully sets out clarification about how individual businesses are to decide where customers are based concern has been raised about the proposals primarily by the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales which notes the principle behind the changes is to provide a level playing field for service providers it says that at the moment it is possible\u2026for a service provider to provide services to consumers across the eu but be based in an eu country with a low vat rate that is charged to all consumers enabling them to undercut service providers in the other eu country who must charge customers the local higher vat rate although the icaew supports the proposals in principle it is concerned that the price of the level playing field could lead to the creation of considerably more complexity and administrative burdens that could discourage intra-eu trade and the efficient operation of the single market it would be helpful if the minister responded to those concerns gave his assessment of the proposals and told us whether he fears that they might have the results that the icaew highlights the icaew also states in addition hmrc has indicated that it intends educational services such as webinars to be exempt from these regulations as a service of education provided where the service is hosted however there remain ongoing discussions at eu level as to exactly what services would be categorised as e-services and in the absence of clear agreement at eu level there is a danger that different countries will treat similar transactions differently it notes that there is a danger that some businesses could find themselves providing services that are subject to double or non-taxation will the minister comment on whether such uncertainty may lead to double taxation or non-taxation and give us his assessment of those concerns is he worried that we do not yet have the result of ongoing eu discussions about exactly what services will be classified as e-services is there a danger that different countries may end up treating transactions differently will the minister outline his plans for publicising these changes and the launch of the vat moss online service to minimise non-compliance and confusion for businesses clearly the change will require fundamental changes to existing it systems is he confident that the new systems will all be fully functional by 1 january next year how are the system upgrades progressing to date ", " it is a pleasure to welcome you back to the chair mr caton as we continue our deliberations i am sure that all members of the committee feel like we have never been away but we are now in the final stretch of our consideration of the bill and i am sure that we will continue to enjoy ourselves just as much as we have done up to this point the minister has allayed some of the concerns about the clause that had been raised by stakeholders and answered many of my questions given his assurances i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment ", " the clause deals with transfer pricing which is an integral part of ensuring fairness in the tax system it is designed to iron out tax inconsistencies that arise when transactions take place between connected parties in essence the rules exist to ensure that the right prices are charged between connected parties on international transactions although they also apply to transactions in the uk when transfer pricing rules are utilised when transactions have not been carried out at arm\u2019s length and when a uk tax advantage has accrued the effect is to increase one party\u2019s profit it is sometimes possible for the other party involved in the transaction to make a claim to reflect the same price which is known as a compensating adjustment at present companies and individuals can claim compensating adjustments one unintended consequence of the compensating arrangements has been that although on one side of the arrangement the taxable profit has increased on the other side the taxable income at the higher rate has been reduced without affecting the cash position of either party individuals are therefore able to extract income from their businesses at the corporate tax rate rather than the income tax rate the technical note on the clause states large partnerships often employ their staff through a separate service company which the partnership owns this arrangement can be used for a number of reasons not related to tax however by choosing not to pay an appropriate fee to the company for providing this service the partnership can activate the tax rules to gain an advantage hmrc is aware that the structure has been promoted as a method to reduce tax liability for smaller partnerships the clause is therefore designed to restrict the use of compensating adjustments when they generate such income tax advantages specifically the main change will prevent persons other than companies within the charge to income tax from claiming a compensating adjustment where the counterparty is a company that means that if the compensating adjustment claim is denied but the claim would have related to excess interest paid by the counterparty the excess interest over an arm\u2019s length amount will be treated for income tax purposes as a dividend rather than interest and will be taxed at dividend rates rather than at rates applicable to interest the changes will take effect in relation to amounts that are referable to times on or after 25 october 2013 any amounts accruing before that time whether interest or service fees are outside the scope of the clause we support measures to prevent schemes whose sole purpose is to avoid paying tax so we support the clause however i want to ask the minister a small number of questions in the document on compensating adjustments by her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs that was issued in october 2013 hmrc estimated that receipts would increase by about \u00a370 million per annum however in the autumn statement much higher figures were given with the post-behavioural exchequer impact in 2015-16 estimated at \u00a3125 million will he explain the difference between those two sets of figures and tell us the methodology used to calculate them will the minister tell us his estimate of how many of these arrangements are seen every year additionally i would be grateful if he could tell us how hmrc became aware that structures promoting the reduction of tax liabilities for smaller partnerships were being set up and whether he plans to review the measure to ensure that no other avoidance schemes flourish as unintended consequences of clause 69 ", "it is clear from the reports published today that the central charge that there has been an organised plot to import extremism that has radicalised children in birmingham has not been met what there has been is unacceptably poor and bad governance which has let children parents and staff down and which must be tackled those two things are not the same does the secretary of state therefore regret the tone of the debate which has sent a clear message to muslim parents in birmingham and beyond that the education of their children will be viewed through the prism of national security ", "if that is the hon gentleman\u2019s intention his clause is far too simplistic does he not agree that in the interests of fairness and consumer transparency consumers have the right to know about the origins of non-religiously slaughtered meat whether that meat has been stunned or not if it has been stunned what method was used and the method of non-religious slaughter that is a lot of information but observant muslims or jews would like that information as well as people who object ", " i beg to move amendment 15 in clause\u00a068 \u00a0page\u00a061 \u00a0line\u00a039 \u00a0at end insert \u2018( ) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within six months of the passing of this act publish and lay before the house of commons a report setting out the impact over the next three years of the changes made to the corporation tax act 2009 and the income tax (trading and other income) act 2005 by schedule 13 ( ) the report must in particular set out (a) how much additional tax revenue the measures introduced by this section are expected to generate to the uk exchequer for each year in which they are in operation and(b) the impact of those measures on revenues lost to the exchequer as a consequence of tax avoidance schemes for each year in which they are in operation \u2019 ", " clause 68 and schedule 13 introduce changes to the taxation of partnerships in particular limited liability partnerships the reforms are designed to prevent tax avoidance through the use of certain partnership structures there are four main changes first there was previously a presumption of self-employment for partners in an llp the new rules remove that presumption and introduce a series of tests designed to stop the disguising of normal employment arrangements through llp structures secondly profit sharing within partnerships can be flexible which in the past has been used to generate tax advantages particularly in relation to mixed-membership partnerships which is when there are both corporate and individual members various structures have been used to allocate profits to a low-tax entity such as a company while losses were allocated to individual partners who could make more tax-efficient use of the losses the new measures aim to prevent these types of arrangements thirdly one of the arguments used to justify the need for mixed-member partnerships was the need to warehouse profits that cannot be paid to partners in cash as a result of regulatory requirements in particular under the alternative investment fund managers directive aifmd firms are obliged to withhold elements of remuneration payable to certain staff including partners or members of an llp and to make the right to receive this conditional or subject to clawback when the rules apply to members of an llp the tax treatment is that all the profit is taxed in the year in which the profits are made irrespective of whether such profits are paid out under the new rules aifmd firms will allow that profit which is required to be deferred to be allocated not to the relevant individual but instead to the firm itself which will pay tax on this at the higher rate when the individual is able to access the profits he or she will be taxed but will receive a tax credit in respect of the tax paid by the firm and any overpayment of tax may be repaid fourthly on asset disposals one partner could previously transfer an asset or income stream to another partner in return for a payment and the transferee might have had a tax attribute that would mean it was not taxed on that income stream under the new rules when a person disposes of an asset or income stream through a partnership and the main purpose or one of the main purposes is to secure a tax advantage the new rules would impose an income tax charge on the person making the disposal or transfer of the asset by way of background llps set up under uk legislation are bodies corporate that combine the organisational flexibility of traditional partnerships with the benefit of limited liability for their members the policy intention when llps were introduced was that they would be treated for tax purposes as though they were traditional partnerships rather than being subject to corporation tax as would be normal for a body corporate that means that individual members are taxed on their share of the profits of the llp in the same way that individual partners in a traditional partnership are taxed the schedule introducing these changes is very long and the rules are detailed and complex there are two very helpful hmrc technical notes which between them have a total of 57 examples each of which contain scenarios that are caught or not by the new rules i rather felt like i was back at bar school as i was working my way through each scenario and working out whether the new rules caught those arrangements or not we support the need for action in this area there has clearly been abuse of the current rules and it is right that action is taken to crack down on tax avoidance in this area the action is supported by stakeholders too the chartered institute of taxation commented at the time there has undoubtedly been some abuse of the current rules with for example cleaners and seasonal agricultural workers being made partners to avoid national insurance the government were right to review the taxation of llp members in the interests of fairness in the tax system the house of lords economic affairs committee also commented the government is clearly right to look again at the taxation of limited liability partnership members as the legislation introduced in 2000 has failed to bring their tax treatment in line with that of general partnerships and provided opportunities to avoid tax liabilities the original consultation on partnerships was launched in may 2013 after budget 2013 in which it was announced that the government will consult on measures to remove the presumption of self-employment for limited liability partnership partners to tackle the disguising of employment relationships through llp structures that consultation closed in early august and the hmrc published a summary of responses on 10 december 2013 alongside draft finance bill provisions there is as i am sure the minister will be aware a widespread view that the legislative proposals before us today which appeared in the draft finance bill are very different from those in the may consultation document indeed the cbi said the consultation process which took place between may and august 2013 sought responses to a much narrower set of proposals \u00a0than those published on 10 december had business known these parameters many more may have responded and those that did respond may have responded differently in addition the office of tax simplification has also been reviewing the whole area of partnership taxation it was commissioned to look into the taxation of partnerships in 2013 the interim report of the ots review was published on 22 january 2014 which was also after the draft finance bill was published in december 2013 that seems a somewhat strange way to go about this review and reform process the key issue in relation to clause 68 and schedule 13 therefore relates to the process the problems with the consultation and the substantially different approach adopted in the draft finance bill and the bill before us today the minister will know that the house of lords economic affairs committee recommended delaying the implementation of the legislation until april 2015 to allow for further consultation with interested stakeholders including business taxation and legal specialists so that the legislation can be targeted properly will the minister explain what consideration he gave to that suggestion and why that approach has been rejected in favour of bringing in the rules much earlier the association of taxation technicians has said it believes that the attempt to provide an objective measure of when a member of an llp is a real partner has in its view resulted in what it considers to be a fairly mechanical approach it fears that this approach takes no account of the modern management structure of partnerships or differences in factors such as size structure complexity the nature of the trade history and career patterns of businesses that are structured as llps as a result the att suggests that there should be a deferral along the lines suggested by the house of lords committee or failing that the inclusion of a clearance provision in the legislation that would enable llps to agree with hmrc the tax status of their members and thereby overcome the uncertainties that it believes are introduced by these provisions however that is not the approach that has been adopted by the minister in the clause and schedule before us it would be helpful to hear from him about the att\u2019s fears and whether he considered the idea of a clearance provision that would ensure that the measures do not unwittingly introduce unnecessary uncertainty into the tax system as i said earlier the office of tax simplification conducted a review of partnership taxation with the results being published on 22 january 2014 introducing the complex legislation before us will affect many businesses potentially leading to structural change on the face of it that might seem a strange process and unnecessary complication while the results of the ots review are still being considered what is the minister\u2019s response to such claims is he concerned that the changes might be seen as a piecemeal approach to reform how will he ensure that the path he has chosen to take with the legislation before us will provide much-needed stability and certainty to the uk tax system another important issue is whether businesses will have enough time to adapt to the changes the passing of which will require some llps to undergo radical restructuring the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales thinks that insufficient time has been allowed for businesses to make the necessary arrangements given the legislative and regulatory timetable \u00a0that the government have pursued llp members subject to the new legislation will be taxed as employees from 6 april 2014 the icaew thinks that the real-time information requirements for reporting payroll data will merely add to the high administrative burden for llps and hmrc what assessment has the minister made of whether businesses have enough time to adapt to the changes what is his assessment of the extent of the administrative burden they will have to bear as a result the icaew has stated that the proposed new rules for salaried members in llps and the non-corporate member rules for all partnerships will involve a significant additional compliance cost for llps have the government evaluated the effect on bottom-line costs for the affected businesses similarly to our attitude to the changes to the rules on intermediaries and disguised self-employment although the opposition welcome measures to counteract tax avoidance what steps will the government be taking to ensure that the employment law aspects of the changes are also reviewed the increasing divide between employment law and tax law has the potential to lead to more uncertainty complexity and unfairness as individuals are taxed as employees but without equivalent employment rights the proposals to tax llp salaried partners as employees might create a further group of individuals who will be in that position what discussions has the minister had with colleagues in other departments including the department for business innovation and skills and the ministry of justice about the impact of the changes and how they will interact with employment law on a broader level it is apparent that many of the problems being addressed by the proposals stem once again from the different tax costs of employment and self-employment as well as the different rates of tax paid by small companies and unincorporated businesses like me the minister will have heard such differences described often as structural problems in our tax system many stakeholders believe that until they are resolved we will continue to see piecemeal legislation being introduced there is a danger that that might make a complex situation and a complicated tax code even worse will the minister set out for the benefit of the committee the steps that the government will be taking to perform a thorough review of the whole issue the chartered institute of taxation also makes an important point about employment status it says the result of the government\u2019s approach in this area and in respect of agency workers is that we now have several definitions of when a worker is employed or self-employed it then gives the example of employment law tests which are well known and in general the result of applying these tests for for example employment rights purposes are followed for tax purposes too it also gives the example of intermediaries legislation it says that these tests apply for tax purposes only and give rise to no employment rights and include ir35 and individuals working through personal service companies individuals working through umbrella companies managed service companies as well as the provisions included in clauses 16-21 of the finance bill 2014 in respect of employment intermediaries we debated that in an earlier sitting the chartered institute also points to employment status in relation to ordinary partnerships it says that these tests have been built up over many years and are largely known and accepted by hmrc and taxpayers now of course we have the employment status provisions in relation to llps the institute says that the test will apply for tax purposes only and the individuals affected will gain no employment rights it fears that the result of all that is a real and growing confusion in the law about how employment status is established does the minister agree if so or if he fears that that may prove to be the case does he propose to look at that for those llps that are uncertain whether the new rules apply to them hmrc\u2019s non-statutory business clearance process will not be available until after the finance bill receives royal assent does the minister think it is right that given that uncertainty in the interim those llps will need to take a view on whether the new rules apply the house of lords committee raised concerns that the proposed changes to tax arrangements for llps will apply only to uk-registered llps and not to those conducting business here but formed elsewhere will the minister explain whether the government will be taking steps to reconsider the position of non-uk llps i should also be grateful if he would give a breakdown of how the government arrived at the potential overall \u00a33 26 billion tax yield for these measures the intention of our amendment is to probe the minister we want to ensure that the expected \u00a33 26 billion tax revenue is realised and we seek reassurance from the minister that the new proposals will be effective in clamping down on this area of tax avoidance and given the detail of the legislative tests introduced by schedule 13 in particular will not inadvertently create more tax avoidance opportunities i would be grateful for clarification on those points ", " as we discussed in relation to clause 62 companies involved in extracting deposits from the earth for example sand gravel oil hard rock or geothermal energy can claim mineral extraction allowances meas are available first for mineral exploration and access expenditures at 25% but that is broadly all expenditures up to first production from a source if a company gets to the point of planning permission but does not then get it it can get relief at the rate of 25% secondly meas are available if a company is successful in its planning application at which point it is deemed to have acquired a mineral asset and the relief is levelled at 10% the clause means that if planning permission is granted the expenditure attracts the higher 25% rate of relief therefore aligning the treatment of successful and unsuccessful applications because the costs of a successful planning application will now be treated as expenditure on mineral exploration and access rather than on acquiring a mineral asset i have a few questions for the minister it would be helpful if she could set out the rationale for the previous differential treatment of the two types of application and expenditure and the reason for them now being aligned what representations did she receive which persuaded her to make that change it would be helpful if she would explain how many companies are active in this area and will now avail themselves of the change made ", " it is a pleasure to welcome you back to the chair mr caton i am grateful to the minister for his comments on the clause particularly his explanation of the definitions used in new subsection (2c) we need to keep a watching brief on this area to ensure that it is not open to the abuse we have seen in the past which we hope the clause will remedy i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment ", " clause 62 aligns mineral extraction allowances with the existing principles of plant and machinery allowances in budget 2013 the government announced that they would consult on proposals to align the treatment of assets for mineral extraction allowances with that for assets eligible for plant and machinery allowances where profits were not subject to uk tax this confirms that mea allowances can only be used for activities that fall under the ambit of british \u00a0taxation it will prevent uk taxable profits from being reduced by offsetting activities that are not subject to british tax the changes to the legislation confirm that for the purposes of meas a mineral extraction trade consists of an activity that is within the charge to uk tax it also confirms that the activity of an exempt foreign permanent establishment is treated as a separate mineral extraction trade for the purposes of meas and aligns the treatment of meas with the existing principles for plant and machinery allowances it further confirms that notional allowances will be given automatically in calculating the profit or losses of the exempt fpe as if the exempt fpe were within the charge to uk tax the tax information impact note tells us that the measure will affect a small subset of companies in the fpe regime that carry on a mineral extraction trade what is the size of this subset how many companies are carrying out the mineral extraction works that would be caught by the clause the note tells us that the measure will be incorporated within routine it and guidance changes how long will it take for that to happen how regularly will those routine changes in hmrc take place could the minister set out the nature of the exempt fpe regime and tell us how many companies are involved ", " the clause amends the targeted anti-avoidance rules in sections 184g and 184h of the taxation of chargeable gains act 1992 on the use of capital losses to shelter income profit a capital loss is incurred when a capital asset investment or real estate decreases in value that loss is not realised until the asset is sold for a price lower than the original purchase price the intention is to put it beyond doubt that the rule includes arrangements involving derivative contracts and other financial products the clause clarifies the operation of one of the chargeable gains targeted anti-avoidance rules it confirms that the rule applies generally to the contrived use of capital losses to reduce income profits by whatever means and it will affect companies that use avoidance schemes that involve claims for relief for capital losses against gains arising on derivative contracts and other financial products this is primarily seen as a technical change but i am interested that it is not expected to have an exchequer impact i should have thought that some revenue to the exchequer that is under threat or is being lost will now be protected it would be helpful if the minister explained why there is a negligible impact on the exchequer as evidenced by the tax information and impact note will he also explain what gave rise to the view that the targeted anti-avoidance rule needed clarification was there case law that went in the wrong direction or is there something of which hmrc became aware through another route ", " the clause gives the treasury the power to extend by treasury order the duration of four 100% first-year capital allowances the enhanced capital allowance schemes those are expenditure on cars with low carbon dioxide emissions expenditure on zero-emission goods vehicles expenditure on plant or machinery for gas refuelling stations and expenditure on plant and machinery for use in designated assisted areas the clause also extends the fourth eca scheme for expenditure on plant and machinery for use in designated assisted areas namely enterprise zones which is due to expire on 31 march 2017 for an additional three years to 31 march 2020 in effect therefore if someone buys equipment that qualifies they can write off 100% of the cost against that year\u2019s taxable profits we introduced the eca schemes in 2001 and we support them in addition one of the enterprise zones affected by the measure is in my constituency and i welcome that too on enterprise zones will the minister explain what the anticipated cost is of expanding the eca scheme for the additional three years what level of take-up is the minister expecting of that eca scheme in those different enterprise zones what impact assessment has been made on businesses that are ineligible for eca due to their location outside an enterprise zone what impact assessment has been made on the effectiveness of the eca scheme on the growth of small businesses in those designated areas on the other three eca schemes affected by the clause what is the government\u2019s expectation of the impact on incentivising businesses to invest in cars with the lowest carbon emissions how much progress do the government expect will be made towards helping businesses to reduce their carbon emissions and encourage a shift to cleaner goods vehicles ", " i beg to move amendment 21 in clause\u00a061 \u00a0page\u00a052 \u00a0line\u00a041 \u00a0at end insert (a) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within six months of this act receiving royal assent undertake a review of the impact of changes made by this section on (i) the uptake of the business premises renovation allowances (bpra) (ii) the number of bpra schemes disclosed through dotas being investigated by hmrc and(iii) the value of bpra schemes disclosed through dotas being investigated by hmrc (b) the chancellor of the exchequer must publish the report of the review and lay the report before the house \u2019 ", " amendment 21 is intended as a probing amendment and i would like to explain to the committee what clarification we are seeking from the minister in his response the express purpose of the business premises renovation allowance is to provide an incentive to bring derelict or unused business properties back to use in the form of an initial allowance of 100% for expenditure on converting or renovating unused properties in disadvantaged areas and bringing them back into use clause 61 does two things it provides for amendments to business premises \u00a0renovation allowances in order to clarify the expenditure that qualifies for relief and it reduces the balancing adjustment period from seven to five years in terms of the amendments to qualifying expenditure the clause clarifies that expenditure is incurred on the conversion or renovation of a qualifying building into qualifying business premises expenditure is incurred on certain types of work building works architectural or design services surveying or engineering services planning applications and statutory fees or permissions expenditure on fixtures is defined at an extraordinary level of detail with the clause clarifying that qualifying expenditure includes automatic control systems for opening and closing doors windows and vents window cleaning installations fitted cupboards and blinds protective installations such as lightning protection sprinklers and other equipment for containing or fighting fires and much more the clause also clarifies that expenditure must be at market value on a building that has not been used in the past 12 months and must be on works that are completed within 36 months if a person who has submitted a tax return becomes aware that their return has become incorrect in that regard they must tell hmrc the clause also confirms that the allowance fully complies with state aid rules in relation to the balancing it says that where qualifying expenditure has been incurred on a qualifying building and a balancing event occurs within five years a balancing adjustment must be made that limit was previously seven years let me give some background in july 2013 it was reported that hmrc had recently received a number of dotas disclosures disclosures of tax avoidance schemes involving business premises renovation allowances that exhibited features that had been part of avoidance schemes that hmrc had challenged in the past the technical note states that broadly the schemes contain a varying balance of genuine expenditure on actual regeneration and some features that have elements of artificiality possibly aimed at ramping-up qualifying expenditure and accelerating tax relief in ways that could be regarded as inappropriate hmrc launched a technical review in july 2013 and asked for comments by 30 september 2013 the main areas of concern were about what constituted qualifying expenditure the use of limited-recourse often circular borrowing arrangements designed to increase the amount of expenditure that is claimed and timing issues the government gave their response to the consultation and decided on the approach that would be taken they concluded that a number of the problems identified by hmrc could be dealt with by clarifying the expenditure that qualifies for the allowances as i detailed earlier that would mean that there was no need according to the government for a targeted anti-avoidance rule broadly we agree that this is the right way forward it is important that action is taken to close down what appears to have become a significant loophole that if not dealt with could drain income away from the exchequer however there are a number of matters that i would like to clarify proposed new subsection (2c) states condition b is treated as met in respect of expenditure incurred on matters not mentioned in that condition to the extent that that expenditure (in total) does not exceed 5% of the qualifying expenditure incurred on the matters mentioned in subsection (2b)(a) to (c) condition b is that the expenditure is incurred on (a) building works (b) architectural or design services (c) surveying or engineering services (d) planning applications or(e) statutory fees or statutory permissions however one of the key problems it has been suggested with the original legislation is a lack of precision indeed the government state in paragraph 3 8 of their response that they have decided to amend the existing legislation to make the scope of the relief more certain in its application however new subsection (2c) seems to fly in the face of that and i fear that it might open up the door again for abuse so i should be grateful if the minister would explain the thinking behind new subsection (2c) and how he can be sure that this will not be used for tax avoidance i note that the government in their response indicate that the 5% is for associated activities such as project management the minister will i hope see that as the provision is drafted there is scope for concern that it might lead to other avoidance measures it would be good to know more detail about how many dotas disclosures were made involving business premises renovation allowances with features that were part of avoidance schemes that hmrc had challenged in the past how many were there and what features did they display it would be useful to know that so that we can assess when the loophole has been successfully tackled as i said at the outset given the lengthy clauses tabled by the government on these issues and the level of abuse that hmrc surmises has occurred we have tabled a probing amendment seeking a review to try to get greater clarification we want to be clear that this clause deals with what is a very real problem and that those claiming the allowance are doing so within the spirit of the legislation and the intention of parliament in enacting it just a short internet search on my part suggested that the construction of some of the schemes means that the allowance can be worth many millions of pounds if it is abused that is clearly a very real risk to the exchequer we all want to ensure that derelict buildings are brought back into use in deprived areas and that it is not used as a tool by those who are just bent on avoiding tax i should be grateful for the minister\u2019s clarification on those points ", " clause 57 is a technical amendment in relation to capital gains tax roll-over relief on business assets essentially it is possible to defer capital gains tax when a qualifying business asset is sold and to reinvest the proceeds in a replacement qualifying business asset the clause updates the list of qualifying assets following a change in the eu rules affecting one type of eu agricultural subsidy it will ensure that farmers are not disadvantaged by changes to the eu\u2019s agricultural subsidy scheme what discussions has the minister had with farmers about the change will he confirm that no additional changes will be required following the changes to eu rules that have prompted the clause how will farmers be made sufficiently familiar with the change will there be an additional administrative burden on farming businesses and if so how big does the minister expect that burden to be ", " clause 58 is another rewrite to correct a tax law error such as the one we discussed in connection with clause 55 in this case the error appears to have gone unnoticed for a lot longer five years after the original legislation was passed the clause concerns roll-over relief on the disposal of tangible assets where the proceeds are reinvested in replacement and tangible fixed assets a tangible asset includes both fixed assets such as machinery buildings and land and current assets such as inventory an intangible asset covers not only intellectual property such as patents copyrights trade marks and know-how but a variety of other assets with commercial value such as agricultural quotas payment entitlements under the single payment scheme for farmers franchises and telecommunication rights the intent behind the law which we support was to deny roll-over relief in those circumstances but a drafting mistake in the tax law rewrite in 2009 appears inadvertently to have reinstated the relief the effect of the clause is to make clear in law that roll-over relief is not available on such transactions as i mentioned earlier it has taken five years for this to come to notice i am interested to know when the minister was made aware of the need for the change and whether it only recently came to light how many companies have taken advantage of this error in law has there been any loss to the exchequer as a result will the minister tell the committee whether there are any current court cases going through the tax tribunal system that might be affected by the measures in clause 58 ", " the minister has answered my question ", " clause 55 makes a technical change to amend an error in the finance act 2013 it ensures that when the split year treatment applies no capital gains tax is charged in respect of gains made by a remittance basis user during the overseas part of the split year currently the opposite is the case and capital gains tax is charged due to a mistake in the 2013 act the split year treatment was introduced from 6 april 2013 and allows a tax year to be split into two parts in eight specific circumstances the split year treatment means that someone can be treated as a uk resident for only part of a tax year if they leave or arrive in the uk part of the way through a tax year the remittance basis allows someone who is not a uk domiciliary to choose to have their non-uk income and gains taxed in the uk only to the extent that they are brought into or enjoyed in the uk therefore income and gains made abroad and left abroad are called unremitted income and gains i have three short questions for the minister when and how did he become aware of the error in the legislation how many people will be affected by the change and what is the expected impact on the exchequer ", " clause 56 will extend the capital gains tax upper limit provisions that apply on a death of a vulnerable beneficiary and extend the range of vulnerable beneficiary trusts that qualify for special income tax capital gains tax and inheritance tax treatment that will enable more vulnerable people to have their property safeguarded for their benefit within a trust while ensuring that it is not taxed more adversely than if it were owned by the individuals themselves clause 284 will from 6 april 2014 extend the definition of a disabled person that is used in relation to trusts with a vulnerable beneficiary to include those in receipt of the mobility component of disability living allowance at the higher rate or the mobility component of the personal independence payment at either the standard or enhanced rate by way of background a beneficiary is anyone who benefits from a trust a vulnerable beneficiary is either a person who is mentally or physically disabled or someone under 18 a relevant minor who has lost a parent through death capital gains tax is a tax on the gain in the value of assets such as shares buildings or land a trust may have to pay capital gains tax if assets are sold given away or exchanged and their value has increased since being put into the trust the trust will have to pay the tax only if the assets have increased in value above a certain allowance known as the annual exempt amount trustees are responsible for paying any capital gains tax that is due they can claim a relief which is calculated in a similar way to income tax relief in that they work out what they would ordinarily have paid if there were no relief and then work out what the beneficiary would have to pay if the gains arose directly to them as individuals they can claim the difference between those two amounts as a relief on what they have to pay in capital gains tax the special capital gains tax treatment does not apply in the tax year when the beneficiary dies i have some questions for the minister last year\u2019s finance bill made a number of changes to vulnerable beneficiary trusts i am interested to know why the introduction of a capital gains tax uplift for trust assets on the death of a vulnerable beneficiary was not included in the finance act 2013 and is instead being introduced now what estimate has the minister made of the current number of trusts with vulnerable beneficiaries do the government agree with the low incomes tax reform group that the current meaning of  disabled person could be expanded further to bring more disabled beneficiaries within the scope of the legislation as we have just discussed in relation to clause 54 for example it could include those who are vulnerable yet not eligible those with fluctuating or early-stage symptoms of mental incapacity those with addictions and those in abusive relationships will the government consider consulting on that point ", " the clause reduces in most cases the period for which an only or main residence automatically qualifies for final period exemption from 36 months to 18 months the exception to that is individuals who are disabled or in a care home and who have no other property on which they can claim private residence relief they will continue to get the 36-month final period exemption the stated policy objective is to make the tax system fairer by reducing the incentive for those with more than one property to exploit the rules while still providing people with sufficient time to sell a previous residence after moving to a new one this measure would increase the capital gains tax liability for an individual who has two or more private residences at the same time for more than 18 months those affected by this change are likely to be wealthy individuals with more than one property we understand the thinking behind the clause and of course we do not want people to be able to effectively play the system and avoid paying capital gains tax artificially we therefore support the thrust of the measures contained in the clause but i seek clarification from the minister on a number of points he will be aware that the ots in its final report said in relation to principal private residence this relief is clearly of considerable importance and is itself a simplification on the basis that it keeps many taxpayers outside the cgt net however there has to be scope for simplification due to the numerous conditions and sub-reliefs causing complexity in anything other than straightforward cases it is therefore proposed that these conditions be reviewed to test which are still appropriate researched to see whether any can be streamlined and rewritten in a simpler format i would be grateful for the minister\u2019s comments on the view taken by the ots after the clause is agreed today does he intend to take on board some of what the ots said and if so what is his proposed timetable for doing so i should be grateful if the minister would set out the evidence base used to establish that 18 months is sufficient time for those who are genuinely trying to move home i am concerned that there might be large regional variations in how long it takes people to sell their home the expectation would be that sales take place in a shorter period of time in london and the south-east where the housing market is much more buoyant but 18 months might not be sufficient to sell in areas where it is less buoyant what assessment has he made of those regional variations some commentators have raised concerns about the definitions contained in the clause and in particular that the relaxation to 36 months only applies where a person is disabled or is a long-term resident in a care home at the date of disposal of the property they fear that the  long-term resident in a care home criterion is too restrictive the low incomes tax reform group has suggested that instead of the current definition catching people who are long-term resident in a care home it might be extended to include a long-term resident in a \u00a0care home respite accommodation sheltered or very sheltered accommodation or those who for reasons of old age or disability choose to sell their homes and live with family or friends the group makes the reasonable point that older or more vulnerable people do not often move into a care home straight away but end up spending time in hospital with family in sheltered accommodation or short-term respite care first it also suggests extending the definition of a disabled person to not only those in receipt of the relevant benefits but those who might be eligible to receive them as well as those who are suffering from a long-term chronic illness i understand the difficulties in capturing all those whom the exclusion to the new 18-month rule is intended to catch while still keeping the system simple and i bear in mind the ots\u2019s comments that i quoted earlier but will the minister set out his views on the definitions that have been adopted by the legislation why has he rejected the wider definitions suggested by the low incomes tax reform group will he keep those matters under review as clause 54 beds in the association of taxation technicians raised concerns about those who are moving to take up a new job and may lose out as a result of the proposed changes it points out that people will often initially move into rental accommodation perhaps to cover a probationary period until permanent appointment in their new job is confirmed they may retain their former main residence as the only house that they own so there is no question of their trying to exploit the rules and artificially avoid paying capital gains tax they may only find a buyer and complete the sale of their house more than 18 months after they moved into rental accommodation it does not seem the legislation\u2019s intention that someone in those circumstances would be liable to capital gains tax what should happen in those cases is the minister concerned that there is a danger that the approach to counter unacceptable exploitation of the current laws might have been imprecisely targeted ", " good morning mr streeter it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again this morning clause 49 and schedule 7 implement a number of recommendations made by the office for tax simplification to simplify the tax rules in relation to employment-related securities such as employee shares or ers options awarded to employees the clause changes the tax treatment of ers and ers options awarded to internationally mobile employees introducing a new relief for certain ers exchanges it simplifies the rules around nil-paid and partly-paid ers and extends the corporation tax relief available to companies in relation to employee share acquisitions the clause also makes some technical changes to the tax treatment of share awards providing a new relief for certain share-for-share exchanges on takeovers and extending corporation tax relief in certain situations principally on takeovers and where international moves are involved we support the changes made by the clause and the schedule given the attempts to obtain some symmetry in the income tax and corporation tax treatment of option gains for internationally mobile employees what steps will the government take to align the new rules in respect of national insurance contributions for imes the new rules for imes introduce additional costs for the employers of imes in that they will need to update their reporting systems they will need to track inbound assignees to a greater extent as they are more likely to be liable for uk income tax and reporting to her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs will increase what is the government\u2019s estimate of the additional costs involved given our earlier discussions about tax-advantaged schemes \u00a0of this nature can the minister say how many companies operate tax-advantaged schemes what percentage of the uk work force are covered and what the overall cost to the exchequer will be of the various reliefs in relation to share schemes have any studies been done to quantify the positive effects that these have on the uk economy ", " what timetable on the consultation and publication of the guidance is the minister hoping for ", " one always likes to be popular i am grateful to the minister for his comments and further to his clarification i am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment ", " we have just discussed the increases in the sip and saye scheme limits which were announced in the autumn statement in addition the clause gives effect to several changes to the rules for employee share arrangements that were recommended by the office of tax simplification in july 2011 the minister asked the ots to review the four schemes to identify when they are complex and place unnecessary administrative burdens on their users and to suggest ways they could be simplified the ots report was published on 6 march 2012 and in june 2012 the government launched a consultation containing 16 proposals for changes to the rules of all four types of scheme in december 2012 the government confirmed that they intended to proceed with the three ots proposals that are found in clause 48 in may 2013 hmrc published details of its proposed arrangement for the self-certification of sip and saye schemes and company share option plans and digital filing of forms and returns for employment-related securities or ers the main changes include the introduction of self-certification by businesses for three of the tax advantaged employee share schemes sip saye and csop to replace the need for approval from hmrc which was previously required secondly there are changes including online filing for all employee share scheme returns and information including for enterprise management incentives emis and non-tax advantaged arrangements providing ers thirdly there are a number of technical changes to the sip saye and csop rules that are designed to clarify legislation including the modification of the so-called purpose test that must be met by the schemes the changes aim to simplify the employee share scheme rules when they might create undue complexities or unnecessary administrative burdens for scheme users so we are broadly supportive of the proposals in the bill the changes came into effect on 6 april 2014 there has been helpful commentary on the changes especially from the quoted companies alliance it broadly welcomed the changes although it noted some points of concern especially the decision not to grandfather previously approved schemes under the new regime the alliance says that having to revisit schemes to see if they comply will place an unnecessary burden on businesses so will the minister tell the committee what discussions he has had with the qca and other stakeholders about such matters is the minister confident that in the absence of a distinction in legislation between serious default and other breaches companies that operate schemes without full-time hmrc share scheme managers will not find themselves facing substantial penalties for inadvertent but ultimately minor mistakes a number of commentators have made that point while broadly welcoming the changes they have asked whether the government have considered how best to assist smaller businesses without an in-house tax team and unrepresented taxpayers to understand the changes and their new obligations will the minister outline the government\u2019s views on those matters the qca and one or two other organisations have been somewhat critical of the new purpose tests saying that they will be no more helpful than the previous tests what is the minister\u2019s response is he confident that the tests will represent a simplification will the minister also confirm whether under the new system if a company misses the deadline for self-certification it will not mean that all the grants for example of saye options in the previous tax year no longer qualify for preferential tax treatment that might go too far and could lead to uncertainty and hardship for employees potentially through no fault of their own ", " it is a pleasure mr streeter to serve under your chairmanship again this afternoon i was beginning to despair that i might not have an opportunity to contribute to the committee today but i am happy to find that i will get to have my say in essence clause 46 does three things it increases the maximum value of free shares that can be awarded annually to an employee from \u00a33 000 to \u00a33 600 by amending schedule 2 of the income tax (earnings and pensions) act 2003 it increases the maximum value of partnership shares that an employee can purchase annually from \u00a31 500 to \u00a31 800 although the value still cannot be more than 10% of an employees\u2019 salary both those changes come into effect from 2014 share incentive plans were introduced in july 2000 to give tax and national insurance contributions advantages to employees when they buy or are given shares in the company they work for companies can offer one or a combination of four types of shares the first type is free shares an employer can award up to \u00a33 000 of free shares in any tax year the clause increases that amount to \u00a33 600 an employer can choose to link the award of shares to its employees\u2019 performance the second type is partnership shares employees can buy partnership shares using their gross pay but there are limits on how much can be spent the clause increases that limit from \u00a31 500 to \u00a31 800 the third type is matching shares where employees can buy partnership shares that will be matched by their employer giving them up to two free shares for every partnership share they buy the fourth type is dividend shares as a shareholder employees may be paid dividends on their \u00a0shares if dividends are received on free partnership or matching shares employers may allow employees to use those dividends to buy more shares employees can use up to \u00a31 500 of plan dividends in that way in any tax year the impact of the clause on the exchequer is a cost of \u00a35 million in 2014-15 and the same amount in each year until 2018-19 share incentive plans were introduced in 2000 as all-employee share ownership plans which were the successor to the approved profit-sharing scheme which ran from 1978 to 2002 they were rebranded in 2001 as sips and very little detail had changed until the announcement in the autumn statement we support the principle of encouraging saving through tax-advantaged schemes but we want to ensure that this aspect of the tax system is having the desired effect and that take-up levels are good and spread out across different types of business and employee and across the economy both by sector and by region the quoted companies alliance welcomed the changes made under the clause it made the point which it has been vigorously pursuing that the limits should rise in line with inflation it would be helpful if the minister indicated whether the government have received additional representations of that kind are the government reviewing the linking of limit rises to inflation or thinking of doing that at a later point this feature of the tax system is there because governments of different party political persuasion have wanted to encourage employees to behave sensibly and responsibly by saving for their futures it would be helpful if the minister indicated whether the level of take-up is sufficiently high to justify government incentivisation and intervention in this aspect of the tax system this is one of the first changes to sips in a very long time so is he sure that the change will in and of itself increase take-up is there sufficient knowledge of these schemes to ensure that they are as successful and taken up as much as possible ", " i beg to move amendment 14 in clause\u00a047 \u00a0page\u00a043 \u00a0line\u00a035 \u00a0at end insert (a) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within six months of this act receiving royal assent undertake a review of the impact of changes made by this section to the income tax (earning and pensions) act 2003 (share incentive plans) on (i) the uptake of share incentive plans (ii) changes made to the maximum value of share incentive plans that can be awarded to an employee (iii) changes made to the maximum amount of an employee\u2019s salary that can be used to purchase share incentive plans (iv) the types of business using share incentive plans \u2019 ", " the clause amends schedule 2 of the income tax (earnings and pensions) act 2003 to allow future changes to share incentive plan annual limits to be made by treasury order the order-making power would apply to the maximum value of sip free shares that can be awarded to an employee and the maximum amount of an employee\u2019s salary that can be used to purchase sip partnership shares both of which we have just discussed in relation to clause 46 under which those limits have been increased i hope that i will make myself popular with the committee by saying that amendment 14 is intended as a probing amendment designed to continue the debate that we have just had on clause 46 the amendment is designed to press the government and to ensure that we will be able to assess the impact of the changes that are being made of course we support the principle but i am sure that all members agree that that principle should be effective in practice i should like to press the minister on take-up levels and the types of businesses and therefore employees that are using the tax-advantaged schemes we have already had lengthy discussions during the debate on clause 3 about the savings ratio being revised downward and the inability of many people to save anything at all and we have discussed pension savings today which are clearly important we want to ensure that the measures before us encourage saving and that the people who need to be aware of it are aware of it and use it in the way envisaged by successive governments does the minister know how much money companies will have to spend on human resources to ensure that they cover all aspects of clauses 46 and 47 could the resource implications for companies prevent the proper take-up of such schemes or prevent some types of business or sector from using them at all are there cold spots in terms of sectors and take-up if so does the minister plan to review and reconsider any issues relating to such sectors with take-up cold spots we also discussed the shares for rights scheme earlier in committee getting information on it has been difficult so we want to continue to press the government on the measure the scheme is a long-standing feature of the tax system and we support it but we should look into its impact so that we can ensure that any increases to the limits will better enable employees to save invest and contribute to their own futures alongside their gaining a real stake in the companies they work for ", " i must apologise to the minister for the number of questions that i put to her but i feel that is my job to do so given that the point of this committee is to carry out line-by-line scrutiny of a very large bill i am not interested in the hmrc coffee shops but i am interested that as she noted some of the hmrc specialists and officials who will engage with clause 30 sit within the large business service i shall continue to put questions to the exchequer secretary about the constant delays that i hear about in relation to the large business service the minister may have missed that that was the thrust of my question given that she does not cover the service on a day-to-day basis i am afraid to say that i did not hear from the minister a compelling reason for the difference in the exchequer impact between proposed new sections 695a and 1305a given her failure to address that point i am minded to press amendment 11 to a division ", " clause 31 applies to loss-making smes conducting research and development activities smes are deliberately targeted for this kind of initiative risks and market failures are most pronounced for smes which are still worthy of support given that they are in the main small innovative companies with very high growth potential clause 31 amends part 13 of the corporation tax act 2009 to increase the rate of payable tax credit for small and medium-sized companies the rate of payable tax credit is increased from 11% to \u00a014 5% of the surrenderable loss the sme research and development relief currently gives an additional deduction from profits at a rate of 125% of the qualifying expenditure that is combined with the normal deduction for such expenditure to give a total deduction of 225% a loss-making sme is able to obtain a payable r and d tax credit at a rate of 11% of the lower of its trading loss for the period and 225% of the qualifying r and d expenditure incurred this gives a maximum payment of 24 75% of the original expenditure the rate of payable credit as a result of this clause is to be increased to 14 5% giving a maximum payment of 32 625% of the original expenditure the uk government provide some significant tax incentives for companies undertaking research and development work the aim is to encourage investment in r and d and make the uk an attractive place for overseas companies to undertake research and development the r and d tax credits regime was introduced by the previous labour government it was an important initiative to put right the decreasing amount of r and d taking place in this country which had been the trend since the early 1990s as a result of our historic interest in the area and of the changes that we made when in government we support the clause and the increase from 11% to 14 5% therein i have some questions for the minister given the increase from 11% i was interested in the rationale for staying at 14 5% exchequer impacts are important but is there another formula-based reason for deciding on that figure the numbers for the exchequer impact go only to 2015-16 the measure is expected to cost \u00a35 million in 2014-15 and \u00a350 million in 2015-16 i wondered why there were no additional costings beyond that point given that the change is not temporary and will become a feature of the r and d tax reliefs regime what is the government\u2019s view on benchmarking the effectiveness of the r and d tax credits regime and on that policy area in relation to government policy on universities and science more generally as the minister is aware there is a lot of debate in the science and innovation policy community on the effectiveness of the different ways in which r and d tax reliefs might be constructed although we support how things are done in our legislative framework many questions have been asked by academics and it would be interesting to know what the government think in particular about the so-called dead-weight cost how do we decide what r and d would have occurred anyway even without the relief being a feature of the taxation system that is important to the reliefs being structured so as to ensure that more research and development takes place in this country that is the broad thrust of our approach to the measure there are issues in relation to whether we are keeping up with competitor countries not only those that carry out similar levels of research and development at the moment in particular the us germany and france but the emerging economies especially china which are putting vast sums of money into research and development at the public-funded government level in universities and in terms of what they are encouraging foreign multinationals to do in their country how do the government see that developing do they envisage further changes to the r and d taxation regime to keep up with the challenges posed by the emerging economies finally i was not clear on the position of eu state aid in relation to the change my understanding is that the amount of payable credit for loss-making small and medium-sized enterprises has been capped at 25% of the qualifying expenditure the increase to 14 5% will take things beyond that cap of 25% because we are now looking at 32 63p of payable credit what conversations have been had about the state aid regulations and with europe more generally to ensure that we do not fall foul of those rules ", " absolutely we have supported the oecd\u2019s beps project and all measures to tackle profit shifting such behaviour is damaging not just for our tax base and how much corporation tax is raised in this country as it also affects businesses that do not engage in that activity that explains why we do not \u00a0oppose the substance of clause 30 our amendment is designed to get to the heart of the difference in the impact for the exchequer of proposed new sections 695a and 1305a however the principles behind clause 30 and the desire to challenge profit shifting that is designed to avoid paying the correct or fair share of tax however that is defined are correct ", " the hon gentleman highlights a number of different ways in which profit shifting occurs one type is transfer pricing while another way of shifting profits is what we have been discussing in relation to the clause governments should tackle such artificial profit shifting between companies in the same group or in other ways in relation to transfer pricing and the oecd process which we support is very much centred on that we want a much better international taxation regime that takes account of all these issues ", " i shall finish my remarks the guidance on proposed new section 1305a will clearly be important to help practitioners to understand how the measure will operate in practice i understand that during the discussions that have already been held with some practitioners indications have been given about what the measure will and will not capture it would be helpful if the committee could be privy to those indications as that would certainly help our deliberations ", " i beg to move amendment 11 in clause\u00a030 \u00a0page\u00a030 \u00a0line\u00a08 \u00a0at end insert \u2018(3) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within six months of the passing of this act publish and lay before the house a report setting out the impact over the next three years of the changes made to the corporation tax act 2009 by this section (4) the report must in particular set out (a) how much additional tax revenue the measures introduced by this section are expected to generate to the uk exchequer for each year in which they are in operation and(b) the impact of those measures on revenues lost to the exchequer as a consequence of tax avoidance schemes for each year in which they are in operation \u2019 ", " clause 30 relates to avoidance schemes that involve the transfer of corporate profits it proposes to insert new section 1305a after section 1305 in chapter 1 part 20 of the corporation tax act 2009 whose intention is to stop arrangements that are entered into to transfer profits between companies in the same group for tax avoidance reasons the way in which we have come to this point with clause 30 and the proposed insertion of new section 1305a into the cta 2009 is illuminating and raises a number of questions the measure follows the announcement of proposed new section 695a of the cta 2009 on 5 december 2013 which was to be introduced in the finance bill 2014 with effect from the date of the announcement that being the date of the autumn statement that measure was intended to close down a type of avoidance scheme in which a company enters into a derivative contract known as a total return swap with a parent company or another group company generally located in a tax haven under the contract all the company\u2019s profits are paid away in return for much \u00a0smaller payments back a deduction is then claimed for the payment under the contract leaving little or no profit chargeable to tax so far so straightforward except that at some point between the announcement of section 695a and its revision which occurred in january 2014 it seems that the hmrc became aware that avoidance schemes were being marketed to circumvent the provisions of section 695a by using arrangements other than derivatives to achieve the same effect which is to try to obtain a deduction for a payment designed in substance to move profits earned in the uk to a tax haven or otherwise to divert profits to generate a tax advantage therefore we have clause 30 before us today and the addition of section 1305a into the cta 2009 three things flow from that sequence of events first i will put this as a question exactly what happened what kind of scheme did hmrc become aware of that was designed to circumvent section 695a so soon after its announcement in the autumn statement at the end of last year it would be helpful if the minister detailed the sequence of events as it would be good for the committee to understand exactly what happens at the coal face when it comes to avoidance activity i understand that section 695a was itself revised as i mentioned in january 2014 a quite helpful technical note accompanied the revision in january will the minister clarify exactly where we are up to with regard to section 695a its revision and its interaction with proposed new section 1305a i note that the exchequer secretary is not here today he and i have had a lot of discussions about avoidance activity and how quickly it can take place he might not have been stunned but certainly i was stunned at the speed of such avoidance activity perhaps because i have been in this role for only a few months those who want to engage in such avoidance activity seem to move very fast and it is good that hmrc has been able to head that off by tabling proposed new section 1305a and that it is proactive in doing so there are however questions about the simplicity of the tax code initially we had a measure designed to clamp down on an avoidance activity almost immediately after we had to table another measure many of the lawyers i have spoken to in relation to clause 30 have raised concerns about additional complexity in the tax code will the minister give us the government\u2019s view on what that means for simplicity in the tax code given that further technical guidance is expected on section 1305a the exchequer secretary and his officials are consulting various tax practitioners and legal advisers who will be engaged in that work when the minister answers that question will she also explain to the committee whether the government view this and another measure as sitting with the work of the office of tax simplification as well another question i have is on the foreseeability of the need for section 1305a given the speed with which the government had to introduce it i assume that when section 695a was introduced in the autumn statement there must have been some investigation at hmrc into the behaviour that was causing concern and the government felt moved to tackle should it have been clearer or more obvious to hmrc that companies \u00a0would move from a total return swap arrangement to a commodities trading-type arrangement which would not be caught by section 695a but which will be caught by section 1305a will the minister explain whether it was the fear around commodities trading arrangements as opposed to total return swap arrangements that prompted the hmrc action that led to the clause the exchequer impacts are illuminating the impact for section 695a as set out in the documents alongside the autumn statement gave a net gain to the exchequer of \u00a340 million for 2013-14 that gain remains at \u00a340 million for 2014-15 goes down to \u00a320 million for 2015-16 and to \u00a310 million for 2016-17 the impact of proposed new section 1305a is much greater for 2014-15 the exchequer impact forecasts a net gain to the exchequer of \u00a360 million that rises to \u00a380 million in 2015-16 remains at \u00a380 million in 2016-17 rises to \u00a385 million in 2017-18 and decreases slightly to \u00a375 million in 2018-19 that differential in the exchequer impacts goes to the heart of our amendment which seeks a review of the exchequer impact of the measures in clause 30 given that the projected exchequer impacts of each section are so different and given how quickly section 695a unravelled and section 1305a was required it raises the question of how effective the sections will be at clamping down on tax avoidance that results from the profit shifting that the government rightly want to tackle what evidence resulted in the significant difference between the two exchequer impacts what was the reason for the underestimation it would be helpful if the committee understood that on the detail of the clause the technical note for proposed new section 1305a was helpful particularly at paragraphs 8 and 9 i will not repeat exactly what they say but the minister will note that their wording is fairly broad and much broader than the wording that we have seen for tax avoidance measures more generally the former lawyer in me sees a number of immediate challenges to the scope of the proposed new section a number of the technical specialists who have looked at the technical note and how the section might be implemented have also raised concerns about the wording as i said earlier i hope that we will get some guidance from hmrc about how the section will be implemented and interpreted i hope that the minister can provide some more detail on that at the moment discussions are continuing with tax specialists and hmrc but the process is not immediately clear i should be grateful if the minister explained when we will get that guidance and whether it will cover interpretation given how broad the wording is at the moment we support measures to clamp down on profit shifting it is a difficult area to deal with and there has been a lot of action on the international front in this regard particularly from the oecd which was called on by g20 finance ministers in 2012 to consider how to deal with the problem of base erosion and profit shifting in february 2013 the oecd presented its report to the g20 finance ministers and an action plan to deal with amendments and changes to international tax rules was requested to combat base erosion and profit shifting that plan was endorsed in 2013 perhaps the minister could help us understand how the government regard the clause\u2019s sitting alongside that oecd beps process because the oecd will consider some relevant issues in its action plan i believe \u00a0that the timeline for the relevant action points that touch on issues raised in the clause is september 2014 which is when the oecd expects to give its report obviously the government have moved a bit further and more quickly than the oecd beps process does the minister expect further changes to this measure and attempts to combat profit shifting beyond what we see already in the clause how confident is she that the clause will be compliant with what will come out of the oecd beps process and that additional amendments will not be needed there is also an issue in relation to the gaar the general anti-abuse rule that came into force on 17 july 2013 which is part of a government approach to managing the risk of tax avoidance looking at the detail of the clause i was struck by the possibility that the gaar could have been used instead of the clause i am not clear why the government did not feel able to rely on the provisions in the gaar rather than introducing the clause it would help if the minister explained the government\u2019s thinking about why profit shifting and the tax avoidance as a result thereof as dealt with in the clause could not have come within the scope of the gaar given that we have not even had a court case yet in relation to the gaar that would help us to understand the government\u2019s thinking about how that will be implemented in a more practical way there remains an issue in relation to resources at hmrc i should be grateful if the minister explained where the experts who deal with this type of tax-avoiding behaviour sit within the wider hmrc framework i assume that they might be connected to the large business service but they might sit in a different team it would help to know how many people are allocated to looking at this type of work so that we can understand how busy they might be when the clause comes into effect in the technical note hmrc concludes that a number of different financing structures may or may not fall under the clause excepting cases where there is a tax-avoidance purpose i am sure that when the lawyers get hold of the measure when the bill becomes the finance act 2014 they will have a lot of fun with it i should be interested to know how at this point hmrc intends to define that tax-avoidance purpose finally i have a couple of questions that have helpfully come from various taxation specialists connected to the chartered institute of taxation they raise an important point in relation to charities and the fact that the legislation seems to catch the normal transfer of profits into genuine charities from their trading subsidiaries can the minister confirm whether those long-accepted transactions will be exempted from the clause ", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr dobbin i am grateful for the opportunity to debate matters related to the rana plaza disaster in bangladesh the anniversary of which was a few days ago i am grateful to be joined by colleagues who have a long-standing interest in bangladesh and who have spoken a great deal about the rana plaza disaster and what it means for the ready-made garment industry in bangladesh our time is limited so i am grateful for their support i know they will also want to make relatively short contributions in the limited time available i was privileged to visit bangladesh last september with fellow members of the all-party group on bangladesh we planned the visit specifically to feed into our subsequent report  after rana plaza which focused on the ready-made garment industry in bangladesh we made recommendations on what we think is needed to get the ready-made garment sector in bangladesh into the right place so that we can ensure that we do not see another rana plaza the disaster at rana plaza claimed some 1 100 lives with 2 500 people injured and it came only a few months after the tazreen fashions fire in dhaka which killed 112 workers there is a pattern of industrial incidents that have claimed lives in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries and it is a stark reminder to the rest of the world that our cheap fast fashion has a human cost that is often hidden those two disasters in bangladesh have particularly helped to bring home the human cost to consumers in britain europe and elsewhere in a way that had not necessarily happened previously i will address the recommendations made in the all-party group\u2019s report but i will first talk about our visit to bangladesh i am pleased that my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow (rushanara ali) is here because we went out to bangladesh together and she was with me when i visited one factory in particular the department for international development which was working with the all-party group during our visit encouraged us to go to the factory the incongruous image that comes to mind when i think of that time is of seven bangladeshi women in shalwar kameez sewing zips on to bright pink skinny jeans that were destined for sale in russia my hon friend and i were in the factory for our work on the all-party group\u2019s report we had been sent there by dfid because it was one of the better factories and had much better standards on health and safety fire risk and work force engagement than many other factories in dhaka dfid was rightly keen for us to see what a good factory in dhaka\u2019s ready-made garment industry looks like when i went into the factory even though it was one of the better factories i took that point on board the first thing that hit home was the unbearable heat the factory was not hot just because of the lovely weather in bangladesh because i am not a wimp when it comes to general heat and nice weather going into that factory the first thing i felt was a blast of heat that was unlike anything i had ever experienced when i stood near those women who were sewing zips on to the pink skinny jeans it was all i could do tomaintain for 10 minutes a reasonable conversation in broken urdu that the women could just about understand before i thought  i have to wrap this up and get over to the other side of the factory because i cannot physically stand here for very much longer i also remember clearly that the women were supposed to be wearing face masks because there was a lot of cloth fibre and dust in the air which is damaging for people to breathe in every day at work but because it was so hot they had to take off their masks even in a good factory that was doing its bit to meet some minimum standards particularly after the rana plaza disaster there were still issues that i as a british woman felt to be serious as i was standing in the factory on the side of the building again in relation to health and safety standards there was what we were told was decent fire escape provision there was a door at the side of the building that led out to a stairwell that went down into the outside courtyard again unlike what sometimes happens in other factories access was clear and there were no boxes of garments in front of the door the access was not blocked unlike pictures we had seen of other less good factories when i saw that stairwell which was the fire exit for hundreds of workers in the factory i thought to myself  god help me if i ever find myself working in a factory like this and having to run out into that stairwell which feels pretty rickety to me that might be because of the british experience and the good safety standards that we expect for ourselves but it was a stark reminder that even what passes for good standards and what outside organisations such as dfid and others say are good standards for bangladeshi workers are things that i do not think many british workers would ever accept for themselves i certainly would not accept them ", "i thank my hon friend for that intervention which highlighted a number of important issues i will come to building standards a little later as i was saying i did not feel that even what i accepted was a good factory represented a safe environment in which i would happily rock up for work do my shift and go home without thinking that i had taken my life in my hands that is a stark reminder if one were needed that even with minimum standards in place there has been a lot of good work on getting standards in place for the sector in bangladesh post-rana plaza there is a long way to go first to meet those standards in the first place and then to get the kind of working conditions in that part of the world that workers in many other parts of the world particularly in this country enjoy ", "i will but i ask my hon friend to be brief ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the ilo plays a very important role and i am pleased that other organisations work closely with it including dfid i hope that that co-operation continues ", "that is an important point when we visited that factory in dhaka i had the benefit of having my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow with me she was able to engage with the workers in bengali and sylheti she had a conversation with them that probed whether what we were seeing was for the benefit of visitors rather than what happens on a day-to-day basis i left confident that what we had seen was a true picture dfid put in place arrangements to work with grass-roots organisations to ensure thatthose standards are not just what someone sees when they visit on any given day but what happens every day for those workers ", "i am afraid that i will not because i have so little time left post-rana plaza there has been a lot of action to try to get better safety standards in bangladesh a number of companies have signed up to the accord on fire and building safety there it covers just less than 2 000 factories which still leaves many thousands of factories not within the scope of the accord that is a concern although the fact that some 1 800 or so factories are covered by the accord is a good thing when we were in the country with the all-party group we had a number of conversations with rajdhani unnayan kartripakkha the bangladesh university of engineering and technology and other stakeholders in bangladesh on regulations and building codes and their enforcement their point was not that the building regulations do not exist because there is a strong and relatively robust system of regulations and codes their point was more on the level of enforcement and capacity having enough trained surveyors architects and engineers to implement the regulations i am the daughter of a civil engineer my dad is an expert in water and waste management systems so i have grown up looking at maps regulations and things like that i was struck that the experiences of those experts was not that different from those of my dad as a civil engineer in britain they had similar relationships with colleagues and brought similar professionalism to bear the problem is that there are not enough of them in bangladesh and they are not organised into professional bodies such as those we are privileged to have in this country with for example the institution of civil engineers and the royal institution of chartered surveyors that is the missing link almost in getting bangladesh to a place where the regulations are properly implemented and enforced when buildings are being put up i am pleased that dfid has decided to focus its energies on fire and safety regulations capacity and so on that is an important step i am a big believer that our activities through dfid in other parts of the world should not be seen as just giving money we should help countries to build up the infrastructure and systems that they need to deal with these issues themselves one thing that remains a concern is that although many organisations are carrying out inspections and reports into building safety in bangladesh are being prepared i am not clear or confident that the information captured will go quickly to a place where it can be implemented for example tesco wrote to me in advance of this debate to say that it had ceased to work with one of its suppliers in bangladesh because it does not believe that the building that the supplier works out of is safe enough it is worried about that but once it has ceased to work with that factory i am not clear what will happen to ensure that the factory ceases to operate or that it takes remedial action to ensure that it is a safe working environment there are so many assessments of building safety covering such a wide geographic area i remain worried that the bangladeshi government will not end up with the data they need to take remedial action in situations where remedial action has not been enforced because the big clothing companies have ceased their relationship and walked away issues remain on workers\u2019 rights and the organisation of the labour force in bangladesh trade unions in this country have been active in trying to support bangladeshi workers to be in a position where they can organise there is a lot of discussion on labour law amendments in bangladesh whether they go far enough and whether workers will soon be able to organise and to negotiate with company owners on wages and their safety at work regardless of the politics of the trade union movement in this house we are privileged to have such things in this country i would very much like to see bangladeshi workers and poorer workers across the world in a similarly strong position when it comes to negotiating rights at work i would be very grateful if the minister said a little more about what dfid is doing to support labour law and rights in bangladesh there has been a lot of discussion about whether to take the united states route which is to deny trade privileges or whether to try to work with the bangladeshi government in a slightly different way which is what the uk and the european union have decided to do there remains as my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow (rushanara ali) said a big issue on the rana plaza compensation fund which does not have half the money that it aimed to have it was said to need \u00a324 million but only \u00a39 million has been raised i find that disgraceful and shocking for the big companies that are involved in this industry which is worth billions and billions of dollars \u00a324 million is small change it is a tiny sum i remain shocked and deeply upset that that fund has still not got the money that it needs i pay tribute to the companies that have paid into it primark which has a base in my constituency wrote to me recently to inform that it has paid in and taken the action that it feels that it can but we need to continue to press other british companies to do the right thing and ensure that that fund has all the money that it needs on compensation for workers in this country we are privileged that we have a body of personal injury law that makes it easy for lawyers to argue on behalf of victims for compensation that truly and accurately reflects lifelong loss of earnings or amenity we have formulae in our legal system that enable us to provide adequate compensation to victims of injury at work and elsewhere but i am worried that the robustness that we expect in britain or elsewhere in europe or in the states through such legal formulae for deciding rates of compensation especially in the cases of injuries that prevent someone from being able to work fully for the rest of their life will not necessarily translate into what will be received by the victims of the rana plaza disaster and their families i would be grateful if the minister could say a little about the british government\u2019s view on compensation as that is important we must ensure that the families of those who lost their lives are adequately compensated as well as the 2 500 people who were injured some ofthem who are desperately poor will never be able to work again and as each day passes they are getting into more desperate circumstances terrible things happen in faraway parts of the world but sometimes good can come out of those disasters and it is our duty to try to find that good one such good is that for consumers in wealthier parts of the world who enjoy fast and cheap fashion this is a reminder of the human cost of our \u00a310 dress from a british high street chain we have responsibility as consumers to think more about that when we are buying and brands need to think not just about the moral and right thing to do but their reputational risk when they find that they may have contributed in some way to the problems that caused disasters such as rana plaza ", "i am grateful to the new financial secretary to the treasury for her introduction to the debate and i congratulate her on her promotion to her new post i look forward to continuing the debate with her in the finance bill committee which got off to such a strong start yesterday when i first looked at the motion i was mystified about the nature of the debate which is why i have thanked the financial secretary for her introduction to it the motion as framed does not exactly leap off the order paper when members go to the vote office as i did to find the convergence documents they will find that the motion still does not quite leap out at us in respect of what is going on in the house this afternoon that situation is not a state of affairs that is alien to members given that we often have to debate issues that can sometimes seem impenetrable to those on the outside and often to those on the inside too let us turn to what could be described as  minus page 2 of the red book i thought it quite telling that underneath a note about the crown copyright and the isbn number are the words printed on paper containing 75% recycled fibre and the budget report combined with the office for budget responsibility\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook constitutes the government\u2019s assessment under section 5 of the european communities (amendment) act 1993 that is relevant to today\u2019s debate as the minister helpfully outlined in her introduction this is in a very small font and is easy to miss and it is not immediately clear what it really means looking at the 1993 act members will have spotted that it refers to the maastricht treaty article 2 of which states the community shall have as its task a harmonious and balanced development of economic activities sustainable and non-inflationary growth article 103 is relevant too as it talks about economic policies being a  matter of common concern that should be co-ordinated within the council for some members of all parties these are the sort of words that are difficult to stomach that article continues for the purpose of this multilateral surveillance member states shall forward information to the commission about important measures taken by them in the field of their economic policy once we break through the rather impenetrable language and the odd nature of this old treaty obligation the emphasis of which has changed from when the obligation was made to the state of play within the eu today what we get to is the fact that the house is essentially being asked to approve the budget red book as a true and accurate reflection of what is happening in the uk economy when we are finally able to frame the questionin that way asking whether the red book is in and of itself a true and accurate reflection of that i would have to say  where shall i start it will probably not surprise government members to know that the opposition do not consider it a true and accurate reflection of what is happening in the uk economylet me start with the top line of page 4 of the red book the government\u2019s long-term economic plan is underpinned by its commitment to fairness i seem to remember that during the run-up to the last general election before the government began their life in the current parliament the right hon member for tatton (mr osborne) who was to become chancellor of the exchequer uttered his famous line about how they were not going to balance the books on the backs of the poor there was also that other famous line about how we were all in it together on the face of it who could say that those sentiments were wrong certainly if they had proved to be genuine we should be in a very different place at the heart of those lines of rhetoric however is the implication of a deep commitment to fairness my charge against the government is that that commitment and the  commitment to fairness to which the red book refers can only be seen as genuine if we accept that  fairness can describe an economic plan that gives a huge tax cut to the wealthiest in our country in the 2012 budget the government announced a tax cut for millionaires that would be worth an average of \u00a3100 000 to each of them a sum that is far out of the reach of millions of people in our country today meanwhile the government are presiding over what might be termed one of our more successful growth industries which unfortunately happens to be the food bank industry the number of people receiving three days of emergency food has grown from 67 000 four years ago to 913 000 how can it possibly be true that as the red book states the government have a deep  commitment to fairness when the richest members of our society receive a huge tax cut while the poorest in ever growing numbers are being forced to use food banks ", "later in my speech i shall deal directly with issues relating to household income and what is happening to the ability of families on low and middle incomes to make ends meet ", "i shall deal with precisely what has happened to the personal allowance later in my speech but let me make this point to the right hon gentleman now it is true that the personal allowancehas risen and the opposition have supported those changes including yesterday when we debated clause 2 of the finance bill in committee however it is also true that ordinary working people continue to be worse off despite the changes and will still be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 this is a classic case of the government\u2019s giving with one hand and taking away much more with the other and it goes to the heart of the  fairness charge that i am laying at their door i was very struck by the suggestion made by a welfare minister lord freud that the reason for the massive increase in the number of people who are using food banks and having to rely on food parcels from them was that there is an almost infinite demand for a free good [official report house of lords 2 july 2013 vol 746 c 1072 ]i had to read that comment several times because i could not quite believe that such words could emerge from anyone\u2019s mouth during a discussion about food poverty and the fact that people are going hungry in our country when the story about the huge increase in the number of people using food banks hit the news a couple of weeks ago i was also struck by the main attack line from those on the government benches the claim that the increase had a lot to do with advertising and the fact that many more people are now aware of food banks ", "i will of course be careful madam deputy speaker however the point that i am making relates directly to what is in the red book to the nature of the motion that we are being asked to support and to whether we are being presented with a true and accurate reflection of what is happening in the united kingdom economy my view and that of other opposition members is that the red book implies that the  commitment to fairness is being met i do not believe that a situation in the united kingdom economy in which more and more people are being forced to use food banks while the government see fit to give a tax cut to the wealthiest in our country indicates a genuine commitment to fairness and it is for that reason that i have rejected the thrust of the motion which asks us to approve the red book as such an accurate reflection and supported the amendment the red book paints a rosy picture of the goals that have been met and the targets that have been delivered but although i looked very carefully i could not find any reference to the government\u2019s failure to meet the terms that they had set themselves for their so-called long-term economic plan the minister said earlier that the government were  on track which is fair enough but the track to which she referred is not the track that the right hon member for tatton said that we would be on when he became chancellor at the beginning of this parliament the government said that the deficit would be eliminated by 2015 but we now know that that is not the track they the are on the deficit will notbe eliminated by 2015 indeed the current forecast is that it will not be eliminated until 2017-18 when we shall be well into the next parliament that is not the test that the government set themselves for their economic plan which has failed on its own terms ", "what we are being asked to do today is approve a document on the basis that it is an accurate reflection of what is happening in the uk economy i am afraid that the document does not accept the fact that the government are not on track to meet the challenge that they set themselves and promised the electorate that they would deliver on at the last election they suggested that if the chancellor\u2019s programme of fiscal consolidation was pursued which it was the budget deficit would be eliminated by the end of this parliament and the fact that that is not going to happen goes to the heart of the motion however the government are not just off track in relation to the central promise that they made to the electorate at the beginning of this parliament about the elimination of the deficit the national debt is rising and the government are set not to meet their target of ensuring that it falls as a share of gdp by 2015-16 although anyone reading the red book in isolation would be forgiven for thinking that everything was going exactly according to their original plan ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention but he will not be surprised to learn that i wholly reject the point he makes government members often try to lay the whole cause of the global financial crisis at the door of the previous labour government but it was a global financial crisis that affected countries all over the world the labour government were not responsible for the fall of lehman brothers in the united states that is the first point i would make in response to him the second point is that this government have now been in power for four years and they cannot keep trying to get off the hook about their own record the important point is that they set a target for themselves previous red books show what was supposed to happen with this programme of fiscal consolidation but it has not proceeded at the pace the government set for themselves that is not spelt out clearly in the red book in open language that anybody could understand anyone looking at the red book would be forgiven for thinking that these are halcyon days and everything is exactly as it was always planned to be but that is not a true and accurate reflection of what is happening in the economy on page 1 of the red book in a section from which the minister quoted we see that gdp growth has exceeded forecasts it also states that the deficit as a share of gdp is forecast to have fallen by a half by 2014-15 compared to 2009-10 again that implies  everything is okay move along there is nothing to see here yesterday\u2019s growth figures and the 0 8% growth we have seen in the first quarter are welcome but they do not make up for the previous three years of flatlining in the economy we have to remember that in quarter 2 of 2010 growth was at 1 2% and in 2010 after coming into power the chancellor said that the economy would have grown by 8 4% by now whereas in fact it has grown by just 3 8% which is less than half of what he forecast again what has happened is not quite as rosy when compared with what was supposed to happen in terms of the challenge the chancellor set himself it is also not as rosy a picture as is painted in the red book let me deal with the point about personal allowances raised by the right hon member for chelmsford (mr burns) we see a similar flannelling about what is really going on in the economy when we look at the impact of tax and benefit changes on people on lower and middle incomes and in particular on the interplay with their living standards the red book tells us that a typical basic rate taxpayer will pay \u00a3705 less income tax\u2026in cash terms than they would have paid in 2010-11 page 10 of the red book tells us that pressures on household budgets  have eased but that is simply not the experience of millions of people on lower and middle incomes in our country i fail to see how that statement can be true at the same time as the obr tells us that wages will be 5 6% down in 2015 compared with 2010 treasury ministers have failed to admit that latter point they have been asked a number of times to accept that the obr has said that wages will be 5 6% down but no treasury minister has ever answered yes or no to that question i will happily give way to the financial secretary if she wants to confirm that that is the case but she is looking at her papers and i think she is going to do what every other treasury minister and colleague of hers has done which is duck the opportunity to confirm on the floor of the house and for the benefit of the record that the obr is right in saying that wages will be 5 6% down in 2015 on the 2010 level ", "and yet people in our country are on average \u00a31 600 a year worse off let us look at the combined impact of tax and benefit changes the institute for fiscal studies figures analysed for us by the house of commons library show that on average people will by next year be about \u00a31 000 a year worse off this comes back to the central point the government say in the red book that pressures on household budgets are easing but people are worse off and not by trifling amounts such as a tenner or \u00a320 quid they are worse off by nearly \u00a31 000 that is a huge sum and it has a huge impact on a family\u2019s ability to make ends meet the government talk a lot about the personal allowance and when the charge is made that ordinary people are suffering a deep-seated cost of living crisis they often say  but of course we have taken a large number of people out of tax altogether because of the increase in the personal allowance although the personal allowance increases have been welcomed and supported by everybody across the house they do not in and of themselves given a family the ability to make ends meet we still have people who are desperately struggling and who have their head in their hands every time a bill comes through the door the truth remains that people on lower and middle incomes are worse off and they will be worse off at the end of this parliament than they were at the beginning of it the balm offered by the increases in the personal allowance in particular is not enough to heal the deep wound that has been inflicted by all the other changes this government have implemented since they have been in power as i say the combined impact of tax and benefit changes means that by next year people on lower and middle incomes will be about \u00a31 000 a year worse off the red book also talks a lot about the government\u2019s economic policy in relation to savers the chancellor famously said if you are a maker a doer or a saver this budget is for you [official report 19 march 2014 vol 577 c 781 ]there was not much in the budget and the red book to help those who are making do the people struggling with the cost of living crisis but for the savers there is much in the red book about retirement choices individual savings accounts and other savings devices the red book has twice as much about savers as about supporting households again however it is not a true and accurate reflection of what is going on in the economy because the red book fails to recognise that for many people saving particularly at the moment is a luxury that is desperately out of reach i can imagine the welfare minister i described earlier as being baffled about why people go to food banks being equally baffled about why people cannot save people go to food banks because they have no money and they are going hungry people do not save because they do not have any money left once they have met their other costs of living hidden away in the documents that accompanied the budget we found that the obr says that the savings ratio has fallen in recent months and is projected to fall every year until 2018 i put that point to the chancellor yesterday when i asked him to confirm that despite his budget for savers the savings ratio is forecast to go down he ducked the question and refused to accept that that is what the obr is saying is happening to the savings ratio in recent weeks we have had a number of surveys particularly an important one carried out by the money advice service which have shown that 16 million british people are living life on the edge with no savings at all just 27% of people say that they can save on a monthly basis and 37% say they have fewer savings now than they had last year the truth which we do not see in the red book is that savers withdrew money from their accounts last year at the fastest rate for nearly four decades according to bank of england figures britons ended up taking out \u00a323 billion from long-term savings in 2015 the ability of ordinary people on lower and middle incomes to save and to have enough money leftover after the working week to put aside even \u00a31 a day is fairly limited again that is something that has not been spelt out in the red book ", "i am afraid that that does not get the government off the hook when it comes to the impact of their own record the decisions that the government have made both in this and previous budgets have left ordinary people worse off the rhetoric around savers and how much there is in the red book for savers in our country misses the point and does not spell it out in ordinary language for the ordinary person to understand that saving is a luxury today for millions of people struggling with a deep-seated cost of living crisis the red book gives a rosy picture of what is happening in the uk economy but is just a good line in rhetoric that is rather removed from the reality of daily life for millions of people in our country for that reason i urge members to reject the government motion and to support our amendment which at the very least introduces an element of reality into what is a surreal characterisation of today\u2019s british economy ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will estimate the cost to the exchequer of raising the \u00a3325 000 inheritance tax threshold to (a) \u00a31 million and (b) \u00a3500 000 in each of the next five financial years ", " i am grateful for the minister\u2019s comments regarding clauses 8 and 9 and the new clause to which we will return towards the end of our sittings we will not oppose clauses 8 and 9 ", " i am grateful for the minister\u2019s comments on clause 4 and the amendment i am minded to press the amendment to a division it is very important i take on board what the minister has said but the change from the rpi measure of inflation to cpi for indexation of taxation limits and allowances is significant regardless of where one sits in relation to whether that is a good or bad thing it is worth having the review so that we can assess the impact of the change and more thoroughly ventilate those issues in public debate ", " clauses 8 and 9 set the annual exempt amount for capital gains tax at \u00a311 000 for 2014-15 and \u00a311 100 for 2015-16 so there is an increase of \u00a3100 a year the clauses therefore override the automatic increases in the annual exempt amount provided in law which are based on the change in cpi over the 12 months to the september prior to the tax year in question the annual exempt amount sets the limit to the chargeable gains that an individual can make in a tax year before becoming liable for capital gains tax unlike the personal allowance that amount is not phased for higher earners but is not available at all for non-domiciled individuals who claim the remittance basis of taxation the effect of the clause is that the annual exempt amount will increase at a rate less than cpi inflation for 2014-15 cpi in the 12 months to september 2013 was 2 7% which would have led to an increase in the annual exempt amount of \u00a3300 that is also likely to be the case for 2015-16 when the relevant measure of cpi inflation would have to fall to 0 9% new clause 4 focuses on the relationship between the government\u2019s scheme known as shares for rights and capital gains tax that government policy has created a status of employee shareholder someone who works under an employee shareholder employment contract the employee shareholder must receive shares in the employer\u2019s company or parent company and the shares must have a minimum value of \u00a32 000 on receipt there is no upper value for the shares the taxation benefit from the policy is that there is no capital gains tax charged on the profit made when disposing of shares there have been a number of debates on the policy in other committees for example when department for business innovation and skills matters have been discussed it has been the lead department for the policy change the opposition have always felt that that was a very peculiar form of contract at the end of the day rights at work are rights we have always raised deep concerns about the impact that the policy could have many have described workers\u2019 giving up significant employment rights for shares in the company that may not be of value to them as the legitimised exploitation of workers the rights given up under the policy such as those relating to unfair dismissal are significant apart from the automatically unfair reasons when dismissal is based on discriminatory grounds or in \u00a0relation to health and safety all other reasons are caught by the scheme those rights are given up other rights to be given up include the rights to statutory redundancy pay to request flexible working except in the two weeks following return from parental leave and to request time off to train those are expected to be given up for an employee to be able to take advantage of the policy when it was announced the chancellor said that it was a new voluntary three-way deal where the company gives the employee shares in the business and the employee replaces their old rights regarding unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership i would challenge that phraseology because rights at work are not the same as the rights of ownership the government say that they will not charge any capital gains tax on the profit made on the shares when the policy was announced the then minister for employment relations and consumer affairs the hon member for east dunbartonshire (jo swinson) who was responsible for piloting the so-called shares for rights scheme said i have every expectation that when we look back at 2013 we will recognise it as having laid the foundations for a thriving and growing employee ownership sector in the uk the hmrc document that accompanied the shares for rights scheme noted as it is entirely new predicting the take up of the new employee status is highly uncertain it is broadly expected that 20 000 to 40 000 individuals a year may eventually benefit from the cgt exemption on disposal of the shares it is fair to say that not only members on this side of the house raised serious concerns about this policy john cridland director general of the cbi said this is a niche idea and not relevant to all businesses a number of other business organisations felt that this was not the right kind of policy to pursue or that its impact on the number of businesses that would adopt the scheme would be very small the criticism from business was significant but the government pressed ahead with their scheme and i think it fair to say that it has been a flop we learned that bis received just 19 inquiries for the scheme in the six months to the end of december according to figures obtained by the financial timesin response to a freedom of information request many members from across the house have been trying to get some of the facts and figures underlying the shares for rights scheme from the minister through parliamentary questions but have not been able to make a huge amount of progress however at least the freedom of information request told us that only 19 inquiries were made that is very low and shows that even given the pitch that was made to businesses they have not been interested in it and have not taken it up the other problem with the scheme something that a number of commentators have focused on is its capacity to foster tax avoidance the obr\u2019s policy costings document said that the cost of the policy was expected to rise towards \u00a31 billion by the end of the forecast period it was very illuminating that it also said it is hard to predict how quickly the increased scope for tax planning will be exploited again this could be quantitatively significant as a quarter of the costing already arises from tax planning even from the outset the ability of the scheme to be manipulated for tax avoidance purposes has always been very real and stark and potentially very large in terms of revenue it is interesting that the scheme was launched at a time of concern about tax avoidance and that still remains the case last summer we had the whole raft of stories about google starbucks and others concern about tax avoidance is extremely high ministers are continually falling over themselves to condemn such behaviour and to say that they have the right policies to tackle tax avoidance at the same time the government bring forward a new tax policy that looks like it will foster a whole new avoidance industry that is what paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies wrote when it considered the obr\u2019s costings document and the \u00a31 billion cost that was expected at the end of the forecast was hidden away in an annexe  it is interesting that we have this policy in place which has not been popular has only raised a small number of inquiries but has potentially opened a huge avenue for tax avoidance the thrust of our amendment is to continue to press the government for greater detail and more analysis of the impact of this policy and what it has done in relation to the exemption from capital gains tax the opposition have committed to scrapping the scheme not only because we feel that it is a flop but because we are concerned about its tax avoidance implications i will therefore press new clause 4 to a division ", " clause 3 has the opposition\u2019s support i am grateful to the minister for what he said on gift aid i note that guidance is forthcoming and \u00a0i look forward to reviewing that when it is available i also welcome his comment in relation to the r85 help sheet and the ongoing work in simplifying that process i am minded to press amendment 2 a review of the type that we have called for particularly in terms of what we know is happening to the savings ratio this year and every year until 2018 is important it will help us to understand better what is happening to savers and the ability of people to save ", " i beg to move amendment 3 in clause\u00a04 \u00a0page\u00a03 \u00a0line\u00a025 \u00a0at end insert \u2018( ) the chancellor of the exchequer shall within three months of the passing of this act undertake a review of the expected impact until 2020 of changes to indexation limits and allowances on (a) the numbers of those not paying income tax in 2014 who begin to be eligible for basic rate income tax over that period (b) the numbers of basic rate income tax payers in 2014 who begin to be eligible for the higher rate over that period (c) the overall receipts from those paying income tax over the period broken down (i) for the average uk household (ii) for the average single-earner uk household with two children (iii) for the average uk household with two earners and two children (iv) for the average single person \u2019 ", " clause 4 changes the basis for automatic indexation of tax allowances and limits such as the personal allowance and the basic rate limit it means that from 2015-16 any automatic increase in those allowances and limits will be made by reference to changes in the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index the change is measured over 12 months to the september before the relevant tax year the automatic indexation can be overridden as it has been for example in 2014-15 when the personal allowance was set at \u00a310 000 and the basic rate limit was decreased amendment 3 again seeks a review into the impact of the changes to the indexation limits and sets out some of the things that should be assessed for the impact that the change will have including the number of people not paying income tax in 2014 but who will be eligible for basic rate income tax over that period the number of basic rate payers who begin to be eligible for the higher rate over the same period and the overall impact that the change in indexation has and the overall receipts from those paying income tax again broken to down to help to illuminate debate in this area for the average uk household single earners with children the average uk household with two adults and two children and for the average single person as well this change from the rpi to the cpi measure of inflation is not new for a finance bill committee it has been discussed in previous finance bill committees and by work and pensions ministers and shadow ministers in relation to bills connected to welfare and pensions uprating this issue has been debated at length by hon members ever since the first set of changes to indexation were made by the government with this move from the retail prices index to the cpi measure of inflation the change is significant the thrust of our amendment 3 is to get some additional analysis of the impact of that change on indexation some have labelled it a stealth tax and there has been a lot of debate about it previously in this parliament it is important that we understand exactly what the impact of the change from rpi to cpi has been both rpi and cpi measure inflation by taking a basket of goods food clothes and petrol looking at what they cost last year what they cost now and finding the proportional difference the cpi differs from the rpi because it leaves housing costs out of the basket of goods that it measures so rises in mortgage payments rents and council tax are not reflected within the cpi measure of inflation the retail prices index however takes those housing costs into account so there is a difference between the two in terms of what they measure and what is in the basket of goods that gives the overall calculation for the value of both those indexes there is also a mathematical difference in the way the retail prices index and the consumer prices index are calculated the rpi calculates what is called the proportional difference using the arithmetical mean between the old price and the new the cpi does not use the arithmetical mean but the geometric mean which gives a different set of figures that mathematical difference between calculating the rpi and cpi means that the rpi almost always gives a bigger figure for inflation each year the rpi rises on average by 1 2 percentage points more than the cpi there is a whole set of issues around the differences between the two measures and around which best and most accurately reflects inflationary pressures when we look at uprating benefits and as envisaged in clause 4 the indexation of limits and allowances under the income tax act 2007 using the consumer prices index means that allowances and tax rate limits would increase at a lower rate than under the retail prices index therefore raising greater revenues the effect of that change over a much longer period could be very significant given the compounded nature of the change the reason why that has been an issue of debate throughout this parliament is because of the significance of that change the fact that it is compounded over time and the big difference between the numbers that result from indexing according to rpi and those that result from indexing according to cpi that has a large impact on government revenues which in turn has an impact on individuals either through limits in allowances and taxation or through benefits that they miss out on the amendment is designed to try to get better analysis about the impact of the changes and what they will mean for different rate payers in our current taxation system in this place there is a lot of debate around rpi and cpi and we bandy those measures about in the westminster village in the conversations we have with journalists and in the interviews that we give however i do not think that they are well understood by ordinary members of the public i sometimes think that the terms that we use in this place as part of our normal discourse when we talk about indexation uprating and so on must seem impenetrable to ordinary people those people are significantly affected by the changes but they do not necessarily understand from our discourse here in westminster what is going on or why certain choices have been made for that reason despite the fact that the move from rpi to cpi has been discussed several times in previous debates we must continue to press the government on that point clause 4 changes things in relation to taxation previous debates have been about pensions and benefits uprating but broadly the same sorts of issues apply in the public debate that we have with ordinary people who are drawn into different tax brackets because of the difference between indexation under rpi and indexation under cpi we must be better able to explain exactly why the changes are being made and what their real impact will be that could illuminate debate well into the next parliament when the government made the change from using rpi to using cpi in the uprating of benefits at the beginning of the parliament there was a suggestion that they would look at the change again if a significant case was made and the arguments were strong enough we will not know whether a significant case has been made or whether the arguments are strong enough to consider indexing differently without better analysis of the impact of the change it would be helpful through a review such as we propose in the amendment to see the impact of the change on basic rate taxpayers to see who gets drawn in and on higher rate taxpayers we do not intend to vote against clause 4 but we will press the amendment to a vote because we think that the matter requires greater analysis and greater public debate it is important to shine a stronger light on what the change means many people have described it as a \u00a0stealth tax as we discussed earlier there will be significant changes in the implementation of taxation and it is important that they do not seem impenetrable or out of reach for ordinary members of the public they have the right to understand exactly what the changes mean and what impact they will have on them the change will have a significant impact on the government\u2019s revenue and that of course is the reason for the change it should be spelled out clearly to the public who will end up paying more we will support clause 4 but we will probably press amendment 3 ", " i beg to move amendment 2 in clause\u00a03 \u00a0page\u00a03 \u00a0line\u00a08 \u00a0at end insert \u2018(6) the chancellor of the exchequer shall undertake a review within six months of the passing of this act of the impact of the reduction in the starting rate for savings and the increase in the starting rate limit for savings with particular reference to (a) the impact on the household savings ratio as measured by the annual assessments of the office for budget responsibility (b) the impact on the annual saving rate including changes in housing equity by (i) age and(ii) income decile \u2019 ", " the clause is about the starting rate for savings which broadly applies where an individual\u2019s income from employment self-employment or pension income is less than the starting rate limit for the tax year after taking the personal allowance into account it increases the starting rate limit to \u00a35 000 in 2015-16 and reduces the starting rate for savings to 0% it also allows individuals to request that no withholding taxes are applied to savings by banks or building societies where it is anticipated that no tax will ultimately be due on those amounts our aim in asking for the review in our amendment is to get some additional analysis of how significant the measure in the clause will be for many people on lower incomes given that the cost of living crisis has led to savings being eroded or not made at all in treasury questions this morning i put it to the chancellor that although he billed the budget as a budget for savers the obr has said and we have seen in the red book that the savings ratio has been revised down for every year until 2018 the truth is that the recession has caused a long-term squeeze on real incomes people are struggling to pay their bills and in those circumstances the capacity of individuals to save greater amounts of money is severely limited when the chancellor made his budget statement i was struck by the way in which he billed his budget he spoke of it as a budget for the makers the doers and the savers but my feeling about the bill as a whole is that it does not have much in it for those who are making do those who are merely surviving day to day week to week as their incomes have taken a huge hit and they have ended up worse off as a result of the choices made by the government since they have been in power for people who are making do just getting by and surviving day to day trying not to be too terrified each time a bill arrives how do they save that is the thrust of the amendment how do they get into a position where they can afford to put aside even a few pounds a \u00a0week in order to build up their savings and take advantage of the measures in the clause the truth is that at the moment saving is a luxury for many people in our country it is a luxury that is far out of reach for people who struggle with a real and deep-seated cost of living crisis which despite recent changes in wages and prices shows no sign of abating and will still be felt for some time to come let us look at the facts the savings ratio itself has fallen in recent months the ratio the amount that is put away as a percentage of after-tax income is lower than in many other wealthy countries raising concerns about the sustainability of our economic recovery from the financial crisis official figures show that the uk\u2019s household savings ratio the percentage of disposable income put aside for a rainy day fell to a near four-year low during the final three months of 2013 at just 5% it was the lowest rate since the 3 1% rate in the first quarter of 2010 a survey by the charity shelter of working adults who pay rent or a mortgage found that with little or no savings to fall back on 3 8 million families could be just one pay cheque away from losing their home that throws into sharp relief the way in which people are struggling at the moment how near to the edge many people live every day and how just one change one pay cheque not coming in can push people over the edge savers withdrew money from their accounts last year at the fastest rate for nearly four decades according to bank of england figures britons took around \u00a323 billion out of long-term savings in 2013 so for all those people who have been able to save and put aside money for a rainy day many more have been dipping into their savings just to make ends meet again highlighting the very real impact of the cost of living crisis the money advice service has said that 16 million britons are  living on the edge with zero savings its surveys from the beginning of this year show that 27% of people say they can save money each month and 37% say they have less savings than last year it also found some of these figures are very striking and bring home the issues that we are dealing with that 71% of uk homes are caught out by unexpected bills the average unforeseen cost according to the money advice service is about \u00a31 000 per household it also found that loans to loved ones are the largest unexpected cost for households with the average loan to family members nearly \u00a32 500 again one sees the interplay between families and individuals struggling to make ends meet and pay the bills and either dipping into the small amount of savings that they have been able to make or having to go to loved ones the famous bank of mum and dad in many cases or other relatives and friends  to ask for help to meet some of these unexpected costs ", " my hon friend is right to draw the committee\u2019s attention to payday lending which has been a big issue on which a number of powerful campaigns \u00a0have been run particularly in this parliament it has been a growing issue it is another symptom of what is happening out there in the real economy what happens to those who find themselves with wages that are \u00a31 600 a year down and even with tax and benefit changes nearly \u00a31 000 worse off many do not have the luxury of savings and those who can save very little what happens after that as i said in the earlier debate many people live in perpetual terror of the size of their gas or electricity bill when there is not enough money to pay it they have to get the money from somewhere if they are lucky enough to have any savings they will dip into them if not they turn to loved ones who may be able to help knowing people who can lend significant sums is in itself a luxury the money advice service said that the average loan to loved ones is \u00a32 500 that is a huge sum not a trifling amount by any measure it just goes to show how significant the issues are when it comes to people being able to make ends meet for those who do not have a loved one who can loan anything like that amount i do not know many people in my constituency who could find a spare two and a half grand to give to a family member to help them cope where else do they go that is why we have seen this huge increase in payday lending which has led to many people simply being abused by the system it is also why we have seen so many people turning to food banks again we had the recent media reports of almost 1 million food parcels being handed out in our country a shocking figure there has been a huge growth in food banks in my constituency that is what happens when people cannot make ends meet they deal with the necessities they deal with the payday lender who may be on their back and try to stop the interest getting ever more out of control they have managed to borrow as much as they could from loved ones they do not have any savings so they have nothing to dip into but if they had had savings they would have exhausted them they then have to start making choices about going hungry or keeping the lights on at their house feeding their children three meals a day and perhaps going hungry themselves and eating just once in the evening i know families in ladywood who make that choice the recent welcome upward trajectory of the relationship between wages and prices one intersection on the graph that went in the right direction in the last set of figures does not wipe out the huge impact there has been on families and their incomes that directly relates to their ability to save which is what the clause deals with the money advice service ran a campaign urging households to save \u00a33 a day to help cover unexpected bills during the year i was interested by that \u00a33 a day it seems like quite a small sum but it is a significant amount for my constituents it is the difference between being able to have lunch for example and going hungry for people in such dire circumstances even that suggested \u00a33 a day saving to cover unexpected bills is far out of reach that brings me to the reasons why people are in a position where they cannot save that much money there was a lot of debate about some of these issues in the committee of the whole house but i will touch on some of them briefly one is energy bills gas and \u00a0electricity bills have risen by about \u00a3300 since 2010 such that the average energy bill for heating is about \u00a31 300 a year a huge increase since the general election even with the change in how fuel poverty is measured that has resulted in significant fuel poverty it is a real problem most families who come to my advice surgeries find the gas and electricity bill to be the biggest obstacle to their being able to make ends meet if people find themselves in that position saving any money at all is a luxury that is far out of reach other factors prevent people from being able to save a significant one is the cost of rent we have seen many more people who are unable to get a foot on the housing ladder and have to rent for longer than they anticipated rents which have increased more than twice as much as wages form a significant part of any household\u2019s expenditure if rent is increasing and people find themselves in rented accommodation for ever longer periods saving any money to meet the much higher expectations for getting a mortgage to buy a house is out of reach for many ordinary people the cost of child care is another reason why people either cannot save at all or can save only small amounts child care costs have soared we have seen the cost of nursery places increase by 30% which is five times faster than pay the cost of a nursery place is now the highest in history the average bill for a part-time nursery place of 25 hours a week has increased to \u00a3107 why does child care feature so highly in the list of things that people worry about and that prevent them from doing other things with their money that the government would like them to do such as putting some money aside for a rainy day child care has a direct impact on the ability to go to work particularly for mums but both parents are affected if child care is unaffordable people will have to make other choices about whether they can afford to work no government wants people to choose not to work because they cannot afford child care as that is not good for those individuals or the economy however child care is having that significant impact on individuals throughout the country and forcing people into making what the government and all policy makers would consider a bad choice that we would not want them to have to make not to go to work those people will not be in a position to put anything aside to save the central point i come back to is that for the people who are in a position where they are making do surviving on a day-to-day basis saving is i am afraid to say a luxury that is far out of reach my final point about why people are in such difficulty and not able to save is on the huge increase in insecure employment among those lucky enough to be in work many more are in part-time work desperate for more hours but unable to get them we have also seen a huge increase in zero-hours contracts that increase in insecure employment has a powerful impact on that individual\u2019s ability to make their income cover their day-to-day costs and puts saving far out of reach how can people put money aside if they do not know how many hours they will be working from one week to the next i know of cases of constituents who have been on jobseeker\u2019s allowance who have managed to get jobs on zero-hours contracts but are not offered any hours every week they are told that they still have that \u00a0contract but will not be offered any hours when one constituent decided to resign because he was offered no hours he was penalised and sanctioned by the jobcentre it is a completely ridiculous position for someone to find themselves in but that is the impact of some of these arrangements on a practical level if someone simply does not know if they can make ends meet from one week to the next because they have no idea whether they are going to get five 10 12 16 or more hours a week how are they able to save any money saving is a luxury for millions of people at the moment even if they are able to eke out a small amount to save this is a very real problem and the government should have taken the opportunity to include measures in the bill to help to tackle some of those practical issues particularly energy and child care costs if they had people would be more able to meet day-to-day living costs so that they could then take advantage of the changes in clause 3 that seek to improve the position of those with small savings amendment 2 would enable us to keep an eye on the savings ratio in particular as i noted according to the budget red book that ratio is forecast to go down every year until 2018 if it was indeed a budget for savers it should encourage people to save more and help more people to afford to save in the first place if someone is simply keeping their head above water there is no way that even \u00a33 a day is within their reach that is the thinking behind our amendment which i hope members will support as in the previous proposed new clauses we debated we have asked for a review because we fear the direction of travel of the savings ratio and the position that people find themselves in with the deep-seated cost of living crisis at least it would force the government to review the impact of what is happening to the savings ratio in relation to the changes in clause 3 and that would be a positive step i have a couple of more general points about clause 3 the proposed changes under the clause are expected to help pensioners in particular a number of taxation experts have made an argument about making pensioners aware of how to benefit from the changes when later and elsewhere in the house the pension changes are debated it will be important to emphasise independent advice and how to get the message to pensioners about their entitlement and how they can take advantage of the changes including those in clause 3 i would be grateful if the minister shed more light on how the government intend to get the message out about the clause and the benefits of the changes for pensioners in particular will he also say whether hmrc has thought about how a similar result to that achieved by the changes in the clause could be achieved through individual savings accounts should the government do more to ensure that all sections of society have access to and knowledge of tax-favoured products lots of people know about isas but they also need to know the details of how they work and the fact that this is deliberate government policy designed to give a tax-favoured product to ordinary people it should not just be the preserve of the wealthy or the financially aware will the minister say something about the government\u2019s thinking on not only the measures in the clause but how they will interplay with existing measures such as isas the chartered institute of taxation raised a couple of technical points in relation to the clause i think the point about the r85 form was made to the minister in its commentary on the clause although the institute welcomes the changes in the clause it points out that people will complete form r85 only if they know about it and if they understand that they are eligible so it goes back to the point i made about getting the message out and making sure that people understand how the systems work and then making sure that they are able to take advantage of them the chartered institute of taxation stated that the onus is on banks and building societies and hmrc to ensure that the r85 system is better publicised clearly if we want people to be in a position where they can take advantage of the measures they will need to know about them and understand them will the minister set out the government\u2019s thinking in relation to the role that hmrc can play in getting the message out the institute also raised a technical point on gift aid liability which is something for us all to be aware of every year when the personal allowance is increased it states that the issue will be particularly acute with the change in april 2015 when the first \u00a35 000 of savings becomes income-tax-free taking many more people particularly pensioners out of income tax overall there is an interplay with gift aid which could catch out some pensioners who made an enduring gift aid declaration will the minister highlight the government\u2019s thinking about gift aid how do they intend to make sure that pensioners do not get caught out when they have made an enduring declaration to a charity should individuals be made more aware or should charities do more to help people who might accidentally get caught out by the measure ", " as i made clear in our discussions this morning the \u00a32 billion figure was not based on numbers prepared by us it was already in the public domain as a result of number work done by liberal democrats and others who suggested that a mansion tax could raise around \u00a32 billion what i made clear \u00a0was that we would set out the shape and structure of the mansion tax that we propose to bring in for properties worth \u00a32 million or more that will dictate the amount of revenue that can be raised we have not yet set out the structure of that mansion tax which could take a number of different forms with potential for mitigation for people who are asset-rich but cash-poor that will dictate the amount of money that will be raised for clarification that is the point i made this morning and it has not changed having always been our position ", " we have had a thorough and lengthy debate i will not rehearse all the arguments save to say to the minister and to place on the record that nothing we have said about the 10p rate and mansion tax has changed since we made the announcement we are happy to put out the details of our proposals in due course and for them to be audited by the independent obr because we have nothing to hide when our numbers and the shape of our mansion tax are ready we will happily share them with everybody we have heard a number of contributions on the three new clauses i understand that new clauses will be voted on at the end of our proceedings at this stage i am probably minded to press them to a division and will do so in due course ", " the hon gentleman was not present this morning so i welcome him to the committee i take on board the point he makes there was a long-standing debate on the tapering of the age-related allowance in fact as i was just about to say the government having established the office of tax simplification asked it to review pensioner taxation the way in which the change was made meant that there were no proposals to deal with some of the more negative sides of the old age-related allowance we did not get to have that debate because the government commissioned an ots review and made a decision when it had effectively produced only its interim report the ots had not made its final recommendations it never got the opportunity and the government jumped the gun the government clearly had in mind an idea of what they wanted to do with the age-related personal allowance all of the other measures were going into the mix for the famous 2012 budget they simply did not allow public debate the debate could have been had if the ots had been allowed fully to report on its review of pension taxation as it was when it made its final report it did not come back to those issues in quite the same way saying that a decision had already been made which is a shame that has prevented thorough and full debate and scrutiny of the measure and is one reason why there was such an outcry calling it a simplification was an insult but in addition there was a review process in place looking at how things might be done differently and more fairly perhaps there were other ways of structuring the age-related allowance even before we got to have that debate and to see what the ots thought the government went ahead and made their decision to phase out both age-related allowances from april 2013 the age-related allowances have been frozen at their 2012-13 levels only existing recipients of both allowances have been able to claim them given the relationship with the personal allowance which in 2015-16 will rise to \u00a310 500 the first of the age-related allowances will now be subsumed within the increased personal allowance the higher age-related allowance for those aged 75 or above is not far behind the difference remaining is only about \u00a3100 or so the treasury analysis showed that 4 41 million people would lose out in real terms as a result of the measure with an average loss of \u00a383 in addition the individuals who turn 65 in 2013-14 will lose out the most as they will no longer be eligible for the higher allowance but will receive the same personal allowance as those aged under 65 on average they are \u00a3285 a year worse off that is a significant change particularly for that cohort of 65-year-olds as of april last year it impacts on their ability to meet their day-to-day costs if the ots had been able to do its final report and if we had had greater consultation and discussion on the measure there would at least have been an opportunity for that cohort to change their plans or at least to account for \u00a0the fact that the change was on its way the way in which the change was made prevented them from having that opportunity it put a great number of people at significant disadvantage it was a significant change and it was strongly criticised at the time age uk has argued someone with an income as low as \u00a310 500 who reaches 65 from april 2013 could be \u00a3259 a year worse than under the current system with very little time to adjust their financial retirement plans the director-general of the saga group dr ros altmann has said a lot of things about the current budget in relation to pensioners and savers she powerfully made the point about the change that it has left middle class pensioners suffering a significant  stealth tax that point about a stealth tax is important again the change was introduced without the opportunity for the office of tax simplification to produce its final report and without the opportunity for greater public debate pensioners were not put on notice that something like the measure was on its way and so could not start taking advice about how it impacts on their arrangements it was brought in as a simplification designed to hide the fact that it was a stealth tax it was rightly criticised and rightly it continues to be criticised ", " i was not in the previous parliament like the hon gentleman so i cannot answer his point off the top of my head i am sure that he is making a point about a labour party policy with which he disagrees in relation to this change a process was in place to look at pensioners and the office of tax simplification\u2019s report however there was a political decision to override the thorough review of these issues that the government themselves put in place which was absolutely the wrong move they created an office to look at these matters and asked that office to commission a review so not to bother with the results of that review just defies common sense what a big fat waste of time would it not have been far better for the government just to come forward and say that they wanted to get rid of the age-related allowances and so they would phase them out link them to the increases in the personal allowance and hey presto i am sure that the office of tax simplification could then have gone on to look at the simplification of other aspects of the taxation system the government\u2019s approach defies common sense there was no point in having the process but not following it up to add insult to injury not only was a whole bunch of time and money wasted on a review that the government ultimately did not really care too much about but it was deeply insulting to hide the political decision at the heart of the policy by attempting to say it was mere simplification and a little standard change that would have no real impact on anyone at all the government\u2019s approach sent out completely the wrong message and lots of those people affected were rightly very angry about it the minister knows that the policy continues to have an impact on pensioners and it is regularly debated in the house i believe it is \u00a0one of the few issues to lead to a debate in the house on an e-petition when my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne north took part in a lengthy discussion about the change the matter still really offends and angers those who have been affected so it is right that through new clause 3 we further attempt to get the government at least to review the policy so that we can have the public debate that was wrongly denied to begin with i hope that government members at least take into account the way in which this change was made and the fact that many people have been affected and there is still much public discontent and anger i hope that they will support new clause 3 when we come to vote on it because it is right that we continue to press the government on a significant change that has had a lasting deep impact but has not received the effective thorough scrutiny that should have taken place through a review we might at least be able to give it such scrutiny and therefore to speak up for a group of pensioners who have suffered as a result of this stealth tax but have no other means at this point of holding the government to account following those remarks it is with regret that i shall bring my comments on clause 2 and our three new clauses to an end when we vote on the new clauses i hope that government members will feel able to support them and the reviews that we have asked for as i said earlier we support clause 2 ", " it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr streeter we all welcomed you in your absence this morning and look forward to serving under you and mr caton for the duration of this committee i am delighted that government members \u00a0were so warm in welcoming me back so that i can continue my remarks on clause 2 and the three new clauses we have tabled i will not go into detail on the matters we discussed this morning but our discussion ranged around clause 2 in particular the increase in the personal allowance which we have said we will support the mere fact of the increase in the personal allowance does not i am afraid to say get the government off the hook when it comes to the wider impact of their economic policies we saw a clear indication of that at treasury questions which directly followed our morning sitting once again government members repeatedly ducked the opportunity to admit what we all know and what the office for budget responsibility has told us which is that people will be worse off at the end of this parliament than they were in 2010 ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention but as i have said it does not get government members off the hook of their own record and what they said would happen if we followed the plan they implemented in 2010 the deficit was supposed to be eliminated at the end of this parliament that is what the chancellor of the exchequer said would happen if we followed his plan for deficit reduction but it has not happened the deficit will not be cleared until well into the next parliament ", " the government have borrowed about \u00a3190 billion more than they said they would at the start of this parliament many of the predictions that were made about what would happen under their plan for deficit reduction have proved incorrect whether growth borrowing or the central question of eliminating the deficit which has not happened ", " thank you mr streeter i would never want to be led astray or get on your wrong side i shall be more careful in my response to interventions henceforth the fundamentals of the points i was making \u00a0on clause 2 on the personal allowance remain we saw greater evidence of that in treasury questions earlier today before we adjourned i introduced new clause 3 which relates to the personal allowance for those born after 5 april 1948 and asks for a review of the impact of the removal of the old age-related allowances for those who turned 65 last april and thereafter i reminded the committee that the opposition proposal relates to the infamous 2012 budget and the so-called granny tax a tax change dressed up as a mere simplification but which has had a very real and deep impact on many pensioners it was wrong of the government to try to dress that up as a simplification although the issue was debated in previous finance bill committees after the 2012 budget it remains significant it is a significant change for those who reached the age of 65 in april last year it is important that we continue to interrogate the government on the impact of the measure that is the thinking behind new clause 3 the age-related personal allowance was a long-standing aspect of the tax system the idea was that the age-related allowance would be given to elderly people on modest incomes to help with the additional expenses faced by older people who have greater day-to-day living costs such as heating it was introduced in 1975 but was modelled on an exemption for elderly people on small incomes dating back to 1957 and previously on an old age relief that went back to the 1920s it was therefore a long-standing well established feature of the taxation system taking into account the different ways in which elderly people are able to react to changes in the cost of living it was designed to help them because they are less able than working-age people to go out and change their circumstances they are dependant on their retirement income and have very little room for manoeuvre when costs fluctuate that feature of the taxation system assisted with those problems it was always based purely on age it was an age-related allowance claimed at the age of 65 there was an additional higher age-related allowance for those aged 75 and over taking into account their even more difficult circumstances when costs fluctuate but incomes remain broadly the same eligibility was never assessed on whether somebody had retired or not the rationale for not going for a retirement basis but for an age basis was the idea that those on fixed incomes could not compensate for the additional pressures when the cost of living increases ", " this has been well discussed in previous finance bill committees that very long-standing feature of the tax system had a genuine rationale behind it that rationale probably still applies with as much force today as it has in the past the way in which the change was made it was dressed up as a simplification and hidden under the carpet was wrong if we are going to make such changes to the taxation system we should do so in a much more open and transparent way there is no doubt that the change has had an impact \u00a0it is right that we continue to press the government on the scale of that impact as we would under the new clause i take the point that the taxation system treats those aged under 65 differently from those aged over 65 however my view is that the age-related personal allowance had merit and was based on a genuine rationale so it should not have been done away with without greater public debate about what the change meant it was never a simple simplification it was a significant taxation change that should not have happened without an open and honest debate on who would lose out why the change was being made and whether there was merit in the original rationale of helping older people whose fixed incomes make it hard for them to deal with the increased cost of living we should have had greater opportunity to think about the impact that the change would have on people in that position ", " the way in which the change was made certainly showed up the hollowness of the government\u2019s claim that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden of deficit reduction as did the reduction in the 50p tax rate about which we have had a lengthy debate we did not hear that claim for a long time after budget 2012 although i think it has crept back in since then and measures such as the so-called granny tax prove how hollow it is if the government are going to have an about-face on who bears the burdens of deficit reduction they should at least own up openly and transparently to what that means it was quite insulting to say that the change was a matter of mere simplification ", " my hon friend makes an important point which goes to the heart of our discussions on the clause those who are well off and adept at taking the right kind of advice to avoid for example the additional 50p rate are rewarded with a tax cut worth more than \u00a3100 000 on average those at the other end of the income scale have no such luck that is an important point especially in relation to what has happened with age-related personal allowances ", "the chancellor said that last month\u2019s budget was a budget for savers so will he tell us why page 106 of the red book shows that the saving ratio is falling and that it has been revised down this year next year the year after and in every year up to 2018 ", " the exchequer secretary knows that we have not made such a commitment and it is not one that we are able to make if labour forms the incoming government in 2015 we will have to deal with a deficit that is still large and borrowing that is much higher than this government said that it would be we will have to make difficult public spending choices we have committed to stick to the coalition government\u2019s overall spending envelope for 2015-16 although we will make different choices within that envelope some of which we have already set out in detail we will continue to bring forward proposals but we will not be in a position to reverse all the decisions made by the coalition government we simply cannot do that because this government\u2019s so-called long-term economic plan [hon members  hear hear ]i am so glad it is 11 24 am and government members have woken up they have however woken up to a delusion on their part because although they trumpet their plan it is one that has failed on its own terms the chancellor said to the electorate in 2010 that his choices \u00a0on the pace of deficit reduction spending cuts and so on would result in the elimination of the deficit in 2015 but that pledge is in absolute tatters such a thing will not happen until well into the next parliament however we look at it the chancellor\u2019s central premise take all the pain now and quickly and all will be okay in five years has fallen apart we welcome the chancellor\u2019s \u00a0growth figures which are starting to move in the right direction but it is worrying that the office for budget responsibility expects growth to slow next year ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for his intervention having briefly looked at hansard reports of debates when the exchequer secretary was in opposition when he made frequent requests for reviews i take on board the fact that making such a request is one of the few tools that oppositions have while we may engage in a little political knockabout in committee around endless requests for reviews reviewing the impact of taxation measures as we envisage under new clauses 1 to 3 is important if we are not going to get a formal obr audit of parties\u2019 manifesto commitments that would be the next best thing it would not be quite as independent because it would come from the government but it would at least put figures into the public domain that could be tested and scrutinised and as i said before that could illuminate public debate i hope that government members will support us when we vote on new clause 1 new clause 2 would require the chancellor of the exchequer to undertake a review of the number of people paying the 40% rate of income tax in each of the years of this parliament to date we tabled the new clause because the question of how many people are within the 40p tax band has become ever more cogent and important as more people have been dragged into that band as a direct result of choices made around increases in the personal allowance and the basic rate the new clause asks for a report because we know that those numbers have gone up as is the case for new clause 1 such a report would allow for more public discussion around the relationship between the personal allowance the basic rate limit and the government\u2019s choice on the 40p limit when i discussed the campaign of the hon member for harlow on the 10p rate i said that he wanted not further increases in the personal allowance but instead to look towards introducing a 10p rate of tax precisely because of his concern that the increases in personal allowance had been paid for by bringing more people into the 40p band he worries that the 40p band covers many more people than ever before ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention the report for which new clause 2 requests would illuminate the debate around how many people are in the 40p band and give space for a public discussion about the size of that band and how many people should be caught by it the ifs analysis of the budget noted putting up the higher-rate threshold by 1% in 2015-16 means that there will be around 5 3 million higher-rate taxpayers in 2015-16 that figure is up from 4 7 million this year and 3 3 million in 2010-11 whichever way we look at it that is a significant change whether we think it is right or wrong it is a big change and it has occurred without a \u00a0huge amount of public debate about the 40p rate about what people think and feel intuitively that it represents and about the number of people now caught by it ", " i agree with my hon friend we have had a big shift given that 2 million more people are caught by the 40p tax band people with what we would instinctively feel are relatively modest incomes are now paying the 40p rate but we have not had any public discussion or debate in this place or elsewhere about whether that is the right direction to go in or where the policy might ultimately lead a review would create space for such a debate i am sure that many people feel perfectly relaxed about more individuals being caught by the 40p band but i would like a more thorough understanding of the impact on those people who are now caught by it if people on more modest incomes for example middle-ranking or senior nhs nurses are now suddenly paying the 40p rate that is an issue for public discussion as those groups are not who people envisage when they think of 40p rate payers our taxation policies have to take account of people\u2019s behaviours and expectations and how they respond to changes in the system but this significant change has happened with little debate we have had lots of discussion about the increase in the personal allowance and i spent so much time on that earlier because the trumpeting of that increase has meant that the government have tried to get off the hook about what they have taken away from people yet people have been left worse off we have had almost no debate about what is happening with the 40p rate the government are certainly not shouting about it from the rooftops so it would be worth having a review to examine what is really going on ", " my hon friend makes an important point about the change that has led to 2 million people being brought into the band people who would never have expected to be in it people\u2019s emotional instincts about and reactions to the taxation system are important as are their expectations of how the system should work and of the points at which they will be caught by certain tax bands levying taxes is a key part of the government\u2019s role but taxes concern people\u2019s money and their expectations of what will happen when they earn certain \u00a0amounts what has happened with the 40p band has changed the expectations of nearly 2 million people who might not have expected to be in that band the fact that so many more people are now covered by the 40p band raises genuine questions for policy makers about our view of the proportion of people we would expect to be caught by it if i am right about 15% of the tax-paying population is now caught by the 40p rate in the \u201980s i think that the figure was 5% whichever way one looks at it that is a significant change without getting into whether it is right or wrong there is clearly a lot of revenue attached to the 40p rate so any government wanting to do anything about increasing its threshold would have to raise a significant sum that would be a big spending commitment for whichever party wanted to go down that road a review would allow us to ventilate these issues better in public there has been a vigorous campaign by the daily telegraph which has led with a lot of stories about the 40p rate but this issue has not really filtered into the consciousness of the public it is important that it does however because it raises a legitimate question for the tax-paying public what do the government think is the right proportion of people paying the higher rate and do they want that proportion to go up or down how do they see this panning out in the future whichever way one looks at it the fact that 2 million more people are covered by the rate is a big deal regardless of politics it is right that we try to have this debate with the public or ultimately more people will be caught new clause 2 would be a sensible step towards achieving that ", " my hon friend again makes an important point he is right that people who have now been brought into the 40p rate who would never have imagined themselves as 40p rate payers will look at the cumulative impact of all the government\u2019s other changes and feel that they are pretty badly off that is why a review into the impact of the 40p rate would be an important first step towards a broader political debate about the rate\u2019s future and where people see it going the right hon member for wokingham (mr redwood) has a strong view which is well known to all in the house about taxation he comes to the debate from a clear position that is different from that of many members on both sides of the committee he believes that income tax in and of itself is dangerous and he is worried about the 40p rate he is on record as wanting to cut the 45p rate to 40p and he would probably ultimately want to get rid of the 40p rate and do something entirely different clearly a debate about the 40p threshold is taking place within the conservative party if media reports are to be believed and the policy positions of some of \u00a0its members including the right hon member for wokingham are to be taken at face value the daily telegraph reports senior conservative backbenchers will over the coming months publicly push mr osborne to include a pledge to increase the 40p threshold dramatically in the next conservative manifesto in the lead-up to the last budget there were many media reports and a lot of debate and discussion about what the chancellor intended to do about the 40p rate the process started with a debate about whether the 45p rate might be cut to 40p which the government have not ruled out but there is a separate debate about the fact that many more people have been dragged into the 40p bracket we heard reports of the chancellor saying that people who pay the 40p rate feel that they are a success because they have joined the aspirational classes they have arrived and everything is great many of those caught by the 40p rate will probably take a different view aside from the political knockabout that we might have about whether the chancellor said that and what his exact words were the bigger point made by that remark if it is accurate is what i said earlier about people\u2019s emotional and instinctive expectations of and reactions to the taxation system i do not think that many nurses or bus drivers expect to be higher rate payers that does not reflect how they view their income which is in relative terms quite modest and certainly does not stretch as far as making them feel comfortable and secure which is an emotional thing those people who feel they are a success if they are paying the 40p rate will probably think that because of the greater security that they would expect to have after they hit that rate and because of their expectations of what their earnings would be and how they would be able to use their disposable income to meet their day-to-day living costs and enable them to save those things go hand in hand but that is probably not the position of all the 2 million additional people who since 2010 are now paying the 40p rate we need to create a public space for a debate on whether the idea that paying 40p makes people a success full members of the aspirational classes and secure in life still holds true in 2014-15 and whether it has held true for the last few years or indeed the last decade there have been big changes for ordinary working people we have discussed many of them in as much as they impact on those who do not pay any tax such as because they are out of work or those on lower and middle incomes however in this bracket there are people who probably feel as though they are on middle incomes yet are paying the higher rate the fact that we have not had this public discussion about such an important aspect of the tax system is damaging for the strength of public debate as parliamentarians we have had a lot of discussion about the additional rate 50p 40p and the wealthiest but we must not forget the many millions more who are in this middle section of society and felt a real squeeze on their living standards but are now in a bracket that they never expected to be in and i imagine feel very sore as a result new clause 2 would at least kick-start a more open honest and public discussion if it is true that there is an impassioned debate happening behind the scenes in the \u00a0conservative party about the 40p rate let us bring it into the open i hope that government members feel that they can support new clause 2 and thus enable all hon members to test the public\u2019s feeling about this issue we should know precisely the size and shape of the burden and how it affects those people who are now caught by it if possible we should try to understand whether it has an impact on aspiration as the right hon member for wokingham might suggest changing the proportion of people who are covered would represent a big spending commitment that has not been discussed at all by any of the political parties at least talking about the numbers of people affected would create decent public space around the issue and again allow us to ventilate more thoroughly how it sits with what has happened with the additional rate the cut from 50p to 45p and at the other end of the spectrum with personal allowances including our proposal for a 10p rate when the committee takes a view on new clause 2 i hope that government members will feel able to support our suggestion new clause 3 relates to the personal allowance for those who were born after 5 april 1948 and would require a review of the impact of the removal of the old so-called age-related allowances for those who turned 65 last april and thereafter the new clause refers to the so-called granny tax a phrase that was coined immediately after the chancellor\u2019s 2012 budget this granny tax has been debated in detail in previous finance bill committees but given that the change for those who turned 65 last april and thereafter is having an impact one year in it is important that we press the government again they were rightly and heavily criticised for dressing up the change to the age-related allowances as a simplification but it is more accurate to describe it as a stealth tax poorer pensioners have paid a price so it is right for us to press the government again because although they weathered the storm about the granny tax they have refused to budge on the impact on poorer pensioners and the issue has not gone away ", " my hon friend makes an important point on which we agree many mps support marriage but it would be difficult for the government to incentivise what we think of as the  right behaviour even if we all thought it was right to try i am not sure that the case has been made for such government interference in people\u2019s personal affairs setting that aside and assuming for a moment that the case for that approach has been won it is difficult to incentivise marriage because from what i have seen of the world people base choices about it on love or how irritated they are and whether both want a divorce at the same time marriage is a difficult thing and a long haul my parents have been married for more than 30 years and have a strong marriage and it takes a lot of hard work i have a firm personal spiritual and religious belief in marriage and hope one day to be married myself but do i think it is my place as a legislator to go into people\u2019s personal relationships and tell them or suggest to them the right way for them to live their lives i am not so sure about that as a member of a religious minority i am protective of the space that individuals have to make personal choices based on their conscience about how to live their lives it is not the role of the government to dictate how we make personal choices it is not right in matters of personal faith conviction or spirituality equally it is not right in matters of love or the heart or practicalities to do with having children and setting up family life i do not think the government should be in that space and even if they try to enter it they cannot succeed very well ", " i am grateful for that indication mr caton ", " i will give way to the hon gentleman but i promise you mr caton that i will very quickly move off this subject ", " my response to the hon gentleman will not get me in trouble with mr caton so everyone is a winner i simply say to the hon gentleman that as i said earlier there are a number of ways in which a mansion tax on properties worth more than \u00a32 million could be structured we are looking very carefully at the different permutations and the ways in which that could be done and we will bring forward our proposals in due course we will happily submit them to scrutiny by the house by the government parties and also by the obr because we believe very strongly that it is good policy to audit parties\u2019 manifesto commitments i am sorry that i cannot as yet give the hon gentleman more detail on the precise shape of the mansion tax we have said that it would apply to properties worth \u00a32 million or more as i said with regard to the precise structure of the tax there are a number of models out there and we have not yet come to a view about the precise structure that we will adopt and put in place if we win the next general election but we will do so in due course that is something we are looking at very carefully ", " i enjoy my hon friend\u2019s interventions he has a knack for getting under the skin of government members and is absolutely right to do so i am glad that once again he has excited the passions of those on the government benches i was fearful that my speech was not having that effect on them but my hon friend came through and once again woke them all up i am grateful to him for that a reintroduction of the 10p rate is not being discussed exclusively by the labour party in relation to our policy proposals government members including the hon member for harlow (robert halfon) have also called for the reintroduction of the 10p rate from what he has said in westminster hall i hope i get this right his primary concern is that more increases in the personal allowance will be paid for by dragging more people into the 40p tax band which i will address when we discuss new clause 2 his worry is that we will soon have families who do not have high wages but who pay the 40p rate those families will potentially include senior police officers and senior nhs nurses he is a government member who supports the reintroduction of the 10p starting rate he perhaps enters the debate from a slightly different position to us but the net effect is further support for the 10p rate i do not think he is alone in wanting more thoroughly to ventilate the starting rate and its relationship with personal allowance increases and the 40p tax band both the personal allowance increases that we have seen and the 10p starting rate have pros and cons and the review called for by new clause 1 would allow us to illuminate public debate on the relationship between personal allowance increases the 10p rate and the increasing number of people being brought into the 40p tax band we tabled new clause 1 because we have a policy on the 10p rate but the relationship between that rate the personal allowance increases and the 40p rate has an impact across the country and hon members are alive to that issue new clause 1 simply asks for a review of the impact of a 10p rate which would go some way towards assisting public and policy debate we are asking for a review which is one of the few things for which we can ask in a finance bill committee i am told by veterans of finance bill committees that people feel  reviewed out by the end of finance bill committee sittings but reviews are important and are one of the few changes that the opposition can propose to a finance bill leaving that aside reviewing taxation policy and calling on the government to publish such reviews has a positive impact on public debate particularly as we get towards manifesto commitments as i have said labour will have a manifesto commitment on the 10p rate even if the government do not bite on the policy of the obr auditing parties\u2019 manifestos a review would be of assistance before i conclude my speech i welcome the new economic secretary to the treasury to her position the shadow chief secretary to the treasury and i welcomed her in her absence during our opening remarks it is good to see another woman on the treasury bench we still have one more woman but the government are doing better than before which is welcome ", " i will come to the substance of the hon gentleman\u2019s point later in my remarks but in essence we think that reintroducing the 10p rate would provide people with a stronger work incentive the steadier incline is preferable rather than going from 0% to 20% the climb to 10% first and then from 10% to 20% does more for work incentives than a simple jump from zero to 20% the marriage transferable tax allowance introduced by the government will ultimately help only one third of married couples or 4 1 million couples it will not help the other two thirds eighty-four per cent of those who gain from the policy will be men and only one in six families with children will benefit as we have previously pointed out to the government if they are trying to send a clear signal about the importance of marriage through the tax system even according to their own analysis the policy is not helping two thirds of married couples the fact that it benefits so many more men \u00a0than women given how much women have suffered from the cost of living crisis and the squeeze on living standards and only one in six families with children also seems somewhat perverse in the committee of the whole house many members who spoke in favour of the policy talked a lot about how marriage gives a stable environment for children and how the children of people who are married and stay together do better on various measures such as school attendance and behaviour i was struck by that we therefore expected the policy to help families with children the most but it does not it helps only one in six such families which seems perverse given the case made by the government for introducing the policy a measure that is supposed to be sending a strong signal about the importance of marriage helps only one third of married couples which is not even half of those who are married and that seems somewhat perverse the policy costs the exchequer \u00a3500 million rising to \u00a3800 million in later years which is not an insignificant sum instead of using it to send that signal which i suspect is more for conservative back benchers than for people out there in the country i do not see a huge clamour for the \u00a33 80 per week for couples who qualify the money would be better put towards a 10p rate which would help 24 million basic rate taxpayers and send a much stronger signal than the marriage tax allowance such a signal would be welcomed by ordinary working people who are in my experience less obsessed about whether they are married or single than about making ends meet and the tax system working for them and being fair the wealthiest have been given a huge tax cut by this government while people on lower and middle incomes are worse off feeling the squeeze and struggling to pay their bills and make ends meet the policy is in effect purely symbolic even the government say it is there to  send a signal why not do something more practical use the money to get genuine practical help to 24 million people rather than one third of married couples and one in six families with children why not do something that would go much further we would be happy to work with the government if they wish to get the numbers right for a starting tax rate of 10p if they were to scrap the marriage tax allowance that would immediately raise \u00a3500 million if we wanted \u00a32 billion to put a 10p band in place that would leave a further \u00a31 5 billion to find i would happily work with the exchequer secretary to find that money we could send a clear signal to people on lower and middle incomes who are desperately struggling and would love a symbolic pledge from the government that would mean something to the pound in their pockets and how much further it could go that would be a better and fairer measure as i said to the hon member for redcar a starting rate would be a better work incentive the policy would reduce taxes for those on lower incomes and strengthen work incentives i take the broader point that some argue that 20p is an adequate starting rate but as i also said to the hon gentleman a steadier incline from 0% to 10% and then to 20% could act as a stronger bedrock sending a more progressive clear signal signals are deemed important in the taxation system and this one \u00a0would be that tax cuts for all working people on lower and middle incomes are a priority the policy would help us achieve that to make a comparison with the marriage tax allowance that could be seen as a symbolic gesture designed to incentivise the social behaviour of staying married that is difficult for government to incentivise because it is not possible to get involved in personal relationships people in bad relationships can by splitting often do better for their children and family life than they can by staying together for the sake of being married personal choices are difficult for government to incentivise through symbolic gestures in the taxation system when it comes the decisions people make about work there are more practical life changes that are easier to incentivise and encourage people to nake it is possible then to help them make the best of their choice at a time of economic difficulty when although a recovery is under way it follows three damaging years of flatlining that have had an impact on ordinary people the government\u2019s priority if they have money to send signals through the taxation system should be to incentivise a type of behaviour that is easier to affect and better for the lives of ordinary working people that behaviour can be incentivised and introduced through a steady increase so that work incentives are improved that would be better than addressing people\u2019s personal and social relationships which will always be difficult for government to encourage or prevent that is much trickier terrain for a government regardless of how strongly we support marriage i speak as a practising muslim whose religion places marriage at the central focus of family religious and spiritual life i am therefore a strong supporter of marriage and i think that the trend in divorce rates and so on has had a big impact on our country and particularly on outcomes for children however it is not for policy makers in this place to tell people what personal decisions to make in their lives whether that be getting married in the first place or staying married when a relationship gets difficult of course many relationships have encountered great difficulty in the past few years because economic circumstances have been challenging for families which makes it harder for couples to stay together we should not try to send a signal about those things through the taxation system that is the wrong priority and i do not think that the policy would be successful in achieving the aims that the government might want to set according to their own figures this tax allowance would not help the vast majority of married couples and it is not worth a huge amount of money to those couples it would be far better to make it part of a broader and wider policy around a 10p starting rate which would help millions more people ", " the hon gentleman is tempting me down a road that he will not be surprised if i choose not take the reason for that is that we will set out as i have said what we anticipate the size of the band will \u00a0be depending on the ultimate shape of our mansion tax policy the structure that we adopt for levying a tax on properties that are worth \u00a32 million or more in addition to the money that we would raise from scrapping the marriage tax allowance will dictate the size of the band that we can ultimately introduce if the hon gentleman will forgive me i will not take him up on that question today however when we have set out the precise numbers of our policy and worked out how big that band can be we will be happy as i have said for the obr to look at and audit those figures because they will part of our manifesto for the general election even if the hon gentleman and the government do not take us up on the proposal concerning the obr and manifesto auditing we will be happy to discuss with him or anybody else the numbers in our policy once we have worked through the detail ", " the policy has not changed it is exactly as it has always been we have always been clear that we want to reintroduce a 10p starting rate which we believe will help 24 million basic rate taxpayers we think that that is a better work incentive for that policy we will use a mansion tax levied on properties worth \u00a32 million or more we have not said that our numbers will yield \u00a32 billion although we know that other people particularly the liberal democrats whose policy was underpinned by the figure have said that a mansion tax would raise \u00a32 billion i think that was based on an assumption that there are 70 000 properties in the country worth \u00a32 million or more those are not our numbers however we have been clear that we will further define the shape and structure of our mansion tax and the amount of money that it will raise as we approach the next general election since we put forward our policy which has not changed it has always been our clear position we have also now that the government have introduced the married couple\u2019s tax allowance said that we think that is the wrong priority we would scrap that allowance and put the money towards our 10p policy that is the only change that has been made to our policy that has always been the position we have reflected on the married couple\u2019s tax allowance and reached the view that it does not even do what the government want it to and that even if it were to achieve some of that it would be the wrong priority it does not help enough people as for incentives marriage is not the type of behaviour that is easy for governments policy makers and legislators to incentivise also i do not think it is our place to try to tell couples what they should do if \u00a3500 million \u00a0rising to \u00a3800 million in later years is available we should use it for something that will have practical benefit for working people a 10p rate would do that ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for that intervention he is absolutely right about what we hear on the doorstep every day ", " all doorsteps doorsteps in ladywood in scunthorpe and i am sure in the constituency of the hon member for elmet and rothwell as well he must accept that ordinary people on lower and middle incomes in his constituency will be worse off in 2015 compared with 2010 that is an undeniable fact perhaps he will be the first government member to admit that people will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 ", " the hon gentleman accepts that people will be worse off in 2015 saying that the situation would be worse under labour does not get the hon gentleman off the hook when it comes to his own government\u2019s record it comes back to the point that i have been making the government use their flagship policy of the personal allowance to behave as though that has made everything a-okay but it has not it is a good measure and it has helped but the government have taken away a lot more with one hand than they have given with the other hand that has raised the personal allowance that will be as true for members of the public in the hon gentleman\u2019s constituency as it is for everybody else ", " the hon gentleman will not mind my quoting back at him that a recent icm poll found that only 26% of people believe that the recovery such as it is is benefiting them or their household a very low number of people in this country feel that they are benefiting he will no doubt put across what he believes to be the views of his constituents i am sure they will make their feelings felt at the general election that will be the arena in which we will ultimately test public opinion on this point the question is whether the recovery is benefiting people on lower and middle incomes do they feel as though they are benefiting are they seeing the difference in their daily lives are they no longer putting their heads in their hands when the gas bill comes through the door because they are worried they cannot pay it i do not believe they are in a position of comfort and not worrying about the measures although the changes to the personal allowance are welcome and have been supported by all parties they do not as i have said get the government off the hook on this central charge that they give with one hand but take away much more with the other on clause 2 and the personal allowance and before i move on to new clause 1 more specifically can the minister help with the point raised by the chartered institute of taxation on the position of low-income taxpayers who also claim benefits it tells us that the position is somewhat more complicated to anyone on most means-tested benefits any tax saving from the raised tax threshold will be offset by a diminution in their entitlement to benefit because means-tested benefits are based on net income after tax accordingly any reduction in someone\u2019s tax bill results in an increase in net income and so reduces benefit entitlement will he speak to that point specifically when he eventually gets the opportunity to wrap up this clause stand part debate it is important that we try to understand the impact on that nexus of low-income taxpayers who also receive benefits it would also be of benefit to the committee if the minister said something about the interplay with universal credit once that is eventually probably hopefully and possibly fully online we wait to see when that might be but assuming that it will be fully up and running it would be helpful if he set out some detail on that will lower income taxpayers receiving in-work benefits be worse off and if so by how much what do the government propose to do to assist with that picture new clause 1 would require the chancellor of the exchequer to lay before parliament a report containing proposals for an income tax rate of 10 per cent on a band of income above the personal allowance the report shall provide for the full benefit of the 10 per cent rate not being available to taxpayers paying the higher or additional rates of tax the report would look at the impact of a 10p rate which is a specific bit of labour party policy ahead of the next general election we have supported the changes \u00a0thus far with the increased personal allowance and we will do so again when we come to clause 2 stand part but in addition to those changes we believe it important right and fair to reintroduce the 10p starting rate of income tax we would use money raised from a mansion tax on the most expensive properties those worth \u00a32 million or more to pay for that more recently after the government managed to find between \u00a3500 million and \u00a3800 million for its marriage tax policy we have said that we would scrap that and also use that money to pay for a 10p band ", " i am grateful to the exchequer secretary for that intervention we have said that we want to bring in a 10p rate but we have not said what the size of that band would be we will set that out closer to the general election there are a number of different ways in which a mansion tax on properties worth more than \u00a32 million could be structured and each would have an impact on the amount of money raised earlier in this parliament the liberal democrats proposed a mansion tax on properties worth \u00a32 million or more which they believed could raise up to \u00a32 billion there are other figures out there for what it could raise some are higher and others are lower we have not yet said how much we would raise as we are still working through the structure of the mansion tax that we would introduce but we will set that out before the general election that would of course have an impact on the size of the 10p band as well ", " i do not think it is a change we have never said that we anticipate that the measure would raise \u00a32 billion we have referred to others who have said that it would raise \u00a32 billion in particular the liberal democrats we have never put a figure on exactly what we think a mansion tax would raise the \u00a32 billion figure has been used by commentators and it has been the working assumption of many people when discussing the mansion tax however we have deliberately not said because we were not in a position to say that it would raise \u00a32 billion we anticipate that it would raise sufficient revenue to give a decent 10p band we will set out our proposals regarding the size of that band and what revenue we think would be raised nearer the general election we have since the government introduced the married couple\u2019s tax break which was debated in committee of the whole house just a couple of weeks ago said that we would scrap that and use the money towards the 10p rate that would change some of the potential figures \u00a0we will set out in greater detail exactly what the shape our mansion tax policy would be as we get closer to the next general election as i have said a mansion tax could be implemented in several ways the government already have some infrastructure in place due to their annual tax on enveloped dwellings and even within that structure a number of variations could be adopted as i said we will set out greater detail on our proposals in due course the opposition believe that bringing back a 10p rate in addition to the increases that we have seen in the personal allowance is an important step on the macro-economic side we have said that we would have made different choices in 2010 regarding the pace of deficit reduction choices that we believe would have meant a more balanced approach to deficit reduction however we also think that we need to make different choices with new priorities to turn our economy around we want to protect the incomes of working people with a new priority in taxation which is why we want to introduce the starting 10p rate as i have said in order to pay for that policy we would introduce a mansion tax on houses worth more than \u00a32 million combining it with the scrapping of the marriage tax allowance recently introduced by the government we would use all that money to cut taxes for working people as i have said the size of the band would depend on the amount that would be raised from the tax on homes worth more than \u00a32 million however the change would ultimately benefit 24 million basic rate taxpayers which gives a clear signal of what we want to do to help people on lower and middle incomes i will focus for a moment on the marriage tax allowance which was introduced recently by the government ", " if we want to air these issues in greater detail at the next general election the government should sign up to our proposal to allow the obr to audit manifesto commitments that will elucidate for the public exactly where the different parties are going with the choices they make we have nothing to be afraid of we believe that our choice is a revenue-raising measure we will set out more about protecting revenue from the 50p rate towards the general election we believe it is a revenue-raising measure and that it could contribute to getting the deficit down in a fair way we have nothing to be afraid of we are quite happy to allow the obr to look at every commitment that the labour party makes whether it is our proposal on \u00a0corporation tax and business rates switch spend which uses all the money from a 1% increase in corporation tax for larger companies to help smaller and medium-sized companies with their business rates we are happy for all those figures to be looked at they are already in the public domain and their essence has not been challenged by the government we are happy for the obr to look at all those things the exchequer secretary should join us in supporting our obr proposal it is a good proposal and would really help to illuminate public debate on all the issues particularly taking into account our earlier discussion about what the parties of government said when they were in opposition whether in relation to vat or other taxation measures if parties have their manifesto commitments on spending independently audited it puts greater pressure on them to make promises that they absolutely intend to keep rather than soundbites designed to deflect debate or misrepresent what then quickly becomes the government\u2019s intended action once those parties get into power ", " the hon gentleman is right that neither of the government parties won the general election let us hope that neither wins next time as well and we have a majority labour government instead i recognise his point about the ifs\u2019s comments but as i said this is a decision that we have made we believe it is a revenue-raising measure and could be used to get the deficit down in a fairer way in fact with some targeted measures we could protect revenue from the 50p rate i take on board the point about behavioural impacts they are real but they can be challenged this is one area where tax avoidance has led to a tax cut rather than anti-avoidance measures this flies in the face of what the government themselves say about their record on tax avoidance it seems unfair to members of the public who will think  well if you\u2019re are well off enough to pay for decent advisers who can tell you how to avoid this higher additional rate of 50p and you\u2019re well organised and can lobby the government of the day to get rid of it you are up for a tax cut everybody else will be worse off because either their wages will be \u00a31 600 a year down or the combined impact of tax and benefit changes will leave them nearly \u00a31 000 worse off ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for his intervention it highlights the point that i have just made we believe that this is a revenue raising measure that revenue can be raised to get the deficit down in a fairer way and other things can be done to decrease the impact of the behavioural changes that we have seen and we would expect to see again if the rate were to go up the first bit of tax avoidance should not mean that somehow we automatically move towards cutting that rate the government have trumpeted their record on tackling tax avoidance yet when it came to the 50p rate they put their hands up very early on and said  oh no we can\u2019t possibly deal with this we are just going to cut the rate and get it down to 45p indeed many people particularly in the conservative party are lobbying hard for the 45p rate to be eliminated as well reports at the time suggested that that was very much in the chancellor\u2019s mind as well in the end he did not go down to 40p again but he will not rule out a move from 45p to 40p despite being asked to so a number of times the prime minister has been asked about this a number of times at prime minister\u2019s questions but he has always ducked the opportunity to rule out the cut perhaps because he knows that the politics of that message would be very difficult once again the wealthiest in our society would get a huge tax cut while everybody else was worse off another fact that government members and ministers have ducked the opportunity to admit on a number of occasions ", " my hon friend makes a good point he is absolutely right one way to bring alive some of these arguments to the public would be for all the parties to submit their manifestos to the obr there is broad support for such a move the obr has indicated that it would happily do this if given the mandate lots of people from across the political spectrum think that it would be a very good thing as i said in response to an intervention from one of my hon friends it would prevent parties from saying things in opposition to fudge an issue or not to admit their plans and then changing their minds or doing something completely different when in government our policy would be a way of holding parties to account for what they say in their manifestos i hope that government members would see that it prevents difficulties for all political parties without all of the infrastructure and support that the government get the opposition have to work doubly hard to ensure that our figures are correct and that they are independently checked before we make any commitments the commitments that we have made already are what we describe as switch spends we have said that we will stick to the coalition government\u2019s overall spending envelope for 2015-16 but we will make some different choices within that to bring forward our priorities whether in relation to corporation tax and business rates or scrapping the marriage tax allowance and using that money for a new 10p starting rate we will make different choices we have set out how we will pay for \u00a0those within the overall spending envelope and we are happy for the obr to look at that to give the obr that function would allow for much deeper public debate and put greater pressure on all political parties to do their sums and get their figures right we could then challenge each other on figures from a position of independent authority rather than as at present our political assumptions on parties\u2019 commitments that would be a good thing and it is a shame that the government have not taken the opportunity to allow that we have attempted to put such a measure in previous finance bills and other legislation brought forward by the government but we have not been ruled in order i hope that the government might take that on ", " my hon friend certainly knows how to get under the skin of conservative members he makes a characteristically powerful intervention i confess that i am not well versed in that history lesson as i was born in 1980 so that was a year before i was born he is right to bring the events of 1979 to the committee\u2019s attention that is exactly that kind of about-face we sometimes see from opposition parties when they come into government that would be if not eliminated decreased significantly by independent audit and the subsequent public debate parties would find it less possible to fudge their way around commitments they were making ", " perhaps that is because they feel that little inspiration is to be had from government members who are in denial about ordinary people on lower and middle incomes being worse off as a result of the government\u2019s decisions i am not surprised that opposition members or indeed those elsewhere are not willing to take inspiration from the government to get back to the personal allowance i was making the point that the government give with one hand but take a lot more away with the other we hear much from government members about what they are giving the personal allowance is the flagship policy that is always \u00a0referred to but the government do not admit to taking things away although we welcome the increase in the personal allowance we have seen big increases it is important to remember that those costly measures in and of themselves are not doing enough to counteract the things being taken away which leave people worse off ", " we have already covered this point the global financial crisis hit and a number of difficult decisions had to be made in the normal run of things one would not want to make such decisions that was why we took a careful approach and came to the view that putting in place a 50p rate was an appropriate way to try to get the deficit down that was the clear position that we had as the government up to 2010 and it is what we will do when hopefully we return to office in 2015 ", " i said that the numbers were uncertain i hope that we can agree on that point with regard to independent analysis the ifs says of hmrc\u2019s analysis in the report preceding the cutting of the rate from 50p to 45p that on a normal margin of error the measure could either raise \u00a3600 million or cost \u00a3700 million so we cannot get away from the uncertainty inherent in some of the numbers the overall value of the tax cut has been \u00a33 billion and that is the starting point we have i take on board the point about tax avoidance that has been made by the government and the exchequer secretary it was also made in the hmrc report ahead of the 2012 budget regarding people avoiding the 50p rate and behavioural changes it is difficult to put a number on behavioural changes and they are all very uncertain it is my contention that rather than the government immediately jumping to cut the 50p rate to \u00a045p which was a highly political decision it would have been better to look at the potential of targeted avoidance measures to stop some of the behavioural changes that might limit the amount raised by the 50p rate it will now be perfectly possible for hmrc to make a deeper analysis because it will be able to look at a further year\u2019s records to assess what has happened the decision to cut the rate to 45p in 2012 was the wrong one however as the 50p rate had not been in place for long enough the exchequer secretary is right that there is huge uncertainty in the figures about how much is raised and the margin for error also adds a huge uncertainty the government say that they want to support people on lower and middle incomes but we have a position in which such people according to different measures are \u00a31 600 a year worse off \u00a3974 a year worse off or have wages that are 5 6% down in 2015 compared with 2010 when that is the situation for millions of people in our country a tax cut for millionaires of more than \u00a3100 000 was not the right priority and not a fair way to get the deficit down ", " it is my view that revenue from the 50p rate would be protected if we dealt with capacity in hmrc and had targeted measures to tackle avoidance this is simply a point on which the exchequer secretary and i will disagree i accept that the numbers that we have to play with are in the public domain of course hmrc has access to much more data than even independent analysts and it certainly has more than the opposition i believe that the 50p rate has the capacity to raise more money than the government have said that it would on the behavioural change that limits so the government say revenue from the 50p rate i think that targeted measures would protect that revenue and contribute towards getting the deficit down more fairly ", " my hon friend makes a characteristically powerful contribution and he is absolutely right it is interesting how exercised government members are when discussing the 50p rate because that is less the case when it comes to trying to deny the fact that \u00a0ordinary working people are worse off perhaps because that is an undeniable truth of what has happened under this government ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention but i disagree that the tax take will decrease i believe that the measure would raise revenue on the analysis that the government have accepted it would raise \u00a3100 million and i think that it has the capacity to do more a set of measures on hmrc\u2019s capacity and targeted anti-avoidance measures to protect revenue could have an impact on getting the deficit down in terms of getting the deficit down more fairly it is important given that ordinary working people are \u00a31 600 a year worse off since the general election that we send a signal about our expectations when it comes to who bears the greatest burden as we get the deficit down after all the government are not averse to sending signals through the tax system as they recently did with the tax allowance for marriage millions of ordinary working people are struggling to pay their gas and electricity bills and are worried about paying for child care they may even have to choose not go to work because child care is so expensive so it is completely the wrong priority to hand some of the richest people in our society a tax cut worth up to \u00a3100 000 that sends the wrong signal and the government should not have done it so we will reverse it ", " we have a clear policy on the 50p rate and we have said that it is part of a policy for a fairer deficit reduction programme we anticipate that that deficit reduction programme will take most of the next parliament so the 50p rate will be in place for that period it could not be clearer ", " my hon friend makes a powerful point and i agree with him the decision about the 50p rate was made very soon after the rate had been put in place at a time when we knew that income had been shifted to avoid the rate after it was reduced the government congratulated themselves on the basis that revenues appeared to go up but they ignore the fact that most of the increase is accounted for by the delaying of bonuses and income shifting in the other direction the government\u2019s whole approach has been wrong to go back to my earlier discussion with the hon member for spelthorne this was a highly political move the government were ideologically committed to the cut and they read the evidence in a way that allowed them to make the case to cut the rate on the basis of revenue they claim that it has raised \u00a3100 million which is not to be sniffed at but they forget that while they focus on those at the very top millions of people on lower and middle incomes are worse off because they are being drawn into the 40p band or because of the combined impact of all of the government\u2019s other measures even though they might benefit from the increase in the personal allowance and the lack of action from the government on issues such as energy and child care the government are also using hundreds of millions of pounds to send signals through the tax system about the importance of marriage but we believe that that money could have been put towards establishing a 10p starting rate of tax for people on lower and middle incomes the government\u2019s whole focus has been wrong by prioritising the wealthiest ahead of people on lower and middle incomes who are ultimately worse off as a result of all these changes ", " my hon friend makes a powerful point i would not hold my breath for an apology from government members but he is absolutely right the opposition have supported increases to the personal allowance and we will do so again today however it often seems that the government think that the increase in the personal allowance which enables them to say that they have taken a relatively large number of people out of paying tax alone automatically makes everything else they have done okay whether increasing vat changing maternity grants in the early part of this parliament or other measures many such changes have had a huge impact on the ability of people on low and middle incomes to make ends meet to that extent the opposition\u2019s position regarding the personal allowance is that it is a classic case of the government giving with one hand but taking away a hell of a lot more with the other ", " i believe that it was the leader of the liberal democrat party the current deputy prime minister i suspect that he will once again have a little bit of amnesia when it comes to what he said before the general election and the changes he has gone on to support in government as deputy prime minister of course that sits alongside pledges on tuition fees and other things that the liberal democrats promised their promises were worth absolutely nothing and they quickly forgot them as soon as they got to share a bit of power in the coalition ", " my hon friend\u2019s memory of what the prime minister the then leader of the opposition and the deputy prime minister the then leader of the liberal democrats said before the previous general election is better than mine i salute his memory he is absolutely right that is exactly what the prime minister said it is something that he conveniently and quickly forgot as soon as he came into government that is an important point it shows that regardless of what those parties said in opposition the promises and assessments of where we would stand if either of them was elected in the end we ended up with both were not worth anything \u00a0it is not as if neither party knew that there was a large deficit that would require some difficult choices that deficit was going to require some difficult choices and at the previous general election the parties set out different approaches to how they would go about reducing the deficit in that context presenting a different picture of what would be needed to achieve the scale of deficit reduction that everyone felt was needed was simply wrong ", " my hon friend is absolutely right many hundreds of thousands more people have been drawn into the 40p tax band i will come to that later in my remarks on new clause 2 which specifically calls for a review that would give us an idea of the changes to the number and proportion of taxpayers caught within the 40p band and enable us to have a much more open and honest debate ", " i will come on to new clause 1 and our policy on the 10p band which focuses specifically on lower and middle-income earners ", " we introduced a 50% tax rate and more importantly have said that an incoming labour government in 2015 would restore it the bigger question for the hon gentleman if he is such a fan of the 50% tax rate is this why is he supporting his government who have seen fit to give a \u00a33 billion tax cut to some of the richest people in our country will he support our policy of restoring the 50p tax rate ", " if only the numbers were as certain as the hon gentleman thinks they are they are not that certain everyone who has modelled numbers on a 45p rate and a 50p rate accepts that there is a high degree of uncertainty on the amount of revenue raised he is forgetting that the figures we have do not give a full picture before the labour government introduced the 50p rate there was a huge amount of income shifting so that people could avoid it when the government announced that they were cutting the rate to 45p lots of people delayed taking bonuses so that they could benefit from that lower rate we saw a lot of income shifting to avoid the 50p rate which made the figures extremely uncertain ", " first the setting of tax and the rate at which people pay tax will always be a political decision so i am surprised that the hon gentleman says the opposition are playing politics the key point on what we do in politics ", " let me finish my point this will always be a highly politicised discussion i am surprised at the hon gentleman\u2019s closing remark i do not know why he is so exercised by that part of what i said ", " if the hon gentleman will let me finish my point i will happily give way this will always be a highly politicised debate it is about the key function of government and of course it will raise lots of questions and passions too in answer to his points the labour government introduced the 50p rate as part of an explicit strategy on deficit reduction that accounts for the fact that we did not introduce it for most of the time we were in government there was a deficit reduction strategy several hon members  rose ", " let me finish our commitment to increasing the rate from 45p to 50p was based around the need to get the deficit down in a fairer way we do not believe that the current figures are an accurate picture of what could be raised from the 50p rate \u00a0especially if we take into account as the hon member for spelthorne failed to do the income shifting that took place which is the basis for those figures ", " i will give way to everybody in a moment when i have finished my point please be patient the income shifting has given us some very uncertain figures but we have made an explicit pledge to get the deficit down in a fairer way if we are the incoming labour government in 2015 we anticipate it will take us most of the next parliament to get the deficit down and the rate will be in place to help us do that several hon members  rose ", " four government members want me to give way i will give way first to the hon member for spelthorne because he wanted to come back at me ", " i simply disagree with the hon gentleman we had a global financial crisis in 2008 which had a huge impact on the nation\u2019s finances we came up with a deficit reduction plan based on halving the deficit over four years a different pace to that followed by the current government as part of that strategy we felt it appropriate to increase the rate to 50p for the highest earners in our country we will return to that if we form the government in 2015 and we will get the deficit down ", " the hon gentleman knows that the real problem in relation to the size of the deficit occurred after the global financial crisis of 2008 up to that point we were in a different place given the circumstances post the collapse of lehman brothers in the states we were absolutely right to make different choices and take different measures we did not make those choices lightly towards the end of the previous labour government we felt it appropriate to raise the rate to 50p to ensure that we were able to get the deficit down in a fairer way we have come back to that commitment ", " it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr caton and that of your co-chair mr streeter when he joins us for later sittings i associate myself with the remarks of the exchequer secretary and my hon friend the member for nottingham east in welcoming the clerks the hansard reporters and others who will assist us in the long weeks ahead i also welcome all members of the committee had they had been here i should have liked to welcome the economic secretary to her new post and congratulate the new financial secretary on her promotion the secretary of state for culture media and sport might feel that he had a well-timed promotion but it is he who he is missing out on the lengthy debates we will have about the bill as my hon friend said serving on this committee is an absolute privilege and in no way a punishment i also welcome to our proceedings a new member of the house my hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east this is his first ever bill committee it is also my first ever finance bill committee so the two of us are newbies together many members who are here this morning are finance bill veterans who have been delighting me with tales of previous committees and their lengthy and enthralling debates we will scrutinise the bill thoroughly as is our duty as lengthy as the bill is it is not quite the longest ever [interruption ] my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne north tells me that that might have been last year\u2019s bill while this finance bill is lengthy however it includes no measures that will do much to help the millions of people throughout our country who are struggling with a real and deep-seated cost of living crisis despite recent welcome changes on inflation and wages the intersection of the right lines on the right graph do not wipe out the impact of the government\u2019s policies on ordinary people on lower and middle incomes and the things that they are struggling with whether they are energy bills child care costs or other things that make it hard for them to make ends meet from day to day ordinary people are worse off the recent figures are welcome but a positive intersection of figures on wages and prices does not overnight make the gas bill easier to pay and nor does it ensure that the recovery that is finally under way benefits people on lower and middle incomes clause 2 increases the personal allowance for those born after 5 april 1948 from \u00a310 000 to \u00a310 500 with effect from 2015-16 it reduces the basic rate limit by \u00a380 to \u00a331 785 for the same year the personal allowance has been much discussed in the house it was a flagship policy in the coalition agreement and it is such a powerful policy for both coalition parties that they often fight each other to take credit for it i am sure that liberal democrat members would love to say that the policy was their idea and always had been while their \u00a0conservative colleagues will say that it could never have been implemented without their support we watch that internal coalition fight with interest however the opposition have also supported the increase in the personal allowance and we will support clause 2 and the rise in the personal allowance to \u00a310 500 in 2015-16 the government would have us believe that thanks to this policy they often refer to it when they are in difficulty with other issues affecting people on lower and middle incomes ordinary people are not suffering they claim that the policy has effectively wiped out the consequences of other decisions that they have made or failed to make the government could have taken other practical measures in the finance bill but they have not thus rendering ordinary working people worse off under this government despite the changes to the personal allowance people on lower and middle incomes are worse off according to the office for budget responsibility they will be worse off at the end of this parliament than they were at the beginning government ministers have repeatedly ducked the opportunity to admit under questioning on the floor of the house that the obr says that wages will be 5 6% down in 2015 from where they were in 2010 i understand why the government do not want to admit that central fact they do not want to admit that people will be worse off in 2015 because they fear that when people are asked at the general election in 2015  are you better off today than you were when this government came to power they will say  no we are not better off as the government know that people will not be better off why do they not want to admit what the obr has clearly stated [interruption ] i note that government members do not like to hear that but i refer them to the obr document that makes it clear in black in white that people will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for his powerful point it is the day-to-day cost of living the bills that land on the doorstep that makes my constituents and i am sure those of others desperately worried about how to make ends meet the pressures include gas and electricity bills child care costs and vat which has had a big impact by adding to fuel costs although the government do not like to admit that the huge impact of the vat changes is that families are thousands of pounds worse off over the life of this parliament ", "to ask the secretary of state for justice how many (a) first-tier and (b) upper-tier tax tribunal (i) judges and (ii) expert panel members there were as of april 2014 for how many days (a) first-tier and (b) upper-tier tax tribunal panel members sat in 2013-14 and how much was paid to tax tribunal panel members in 2013-14 ", "i rise to support amendment 4 which stands in my name and those of my right hon and hon friends our amendment seeks to require the chancellor to publish a report on the impact of setting the additional rate the top rate of income tax at 50% but unlike new clause 4 our amendment requires that the report must also estimate the impact of the top rate in 2014-15 if it is set at 45% and at 50% on the amount of income tax currently paid by someone with a taxable income of \u00a3150 000 a year and of \u00a31 million a year our amendment therefore seeks to prescribe somewhat more than new clause 4 what the report that must be prepared by the chancellor of the exchequer should include we intend to press our amendment to a vote at the end of the debate the labour government introduced the 50p rate which came into effect in 2010-11 we have had a number of debates on the top rate of tax ever since particularly since this chancellor\u2019s decision to reduce the top rate from 50p to 45p that decision is an important indicator of both the chancellor\u2019s and his government\u2019s priorities while ordinary people have been struggling with the cost of living crisis based just on a measure of wages they are \u00a31 600 a year worse off or taking into account tax and benefits changes they are \u00a3974 a year worse off the chancellor has seen fit to give a tax cut worth an average \u00a3100 000 to millionaires in our country when the government came to power they did not say anything in the coalition agreement about abolishing the 50p rate in 2011 the chancellor said that he was going to ask hmrc to look at the yields from the 50p rate in 2012 with hmrc\u2019s report  the exchequer effect of the 50% additional rate of income tax to back him up he abolished the rate the chancellor knew that he needed cover for that deeply ideological decision and so was desperate in my view to claim that the 50p rate raised as little money as possible of course if he could say that he could justify with more of a straight face giving a tax cut to the richest in our country at the same time as knowing that on his watch ordinary people those on middle and low incomes have paid the price for his economic plan which is failing on the terms he set himself when he came to power in 2010 this was a highly political decision driven by a desire to give a tax cut to the richest people in our country reports at the time suggested that the chancellor wanted to go further and cut the top rate back down to 40p but was blocked from doing so by his coalition colleagues as a compromise 45p was settled on of course we know that the conservative party is chomping at the bit to see the rate lowered from 45p to 40p and it is a shame that the right hon member for wokingham (mr redwood) has not been in the chamber for this part of the debate although we did cover some of his views in this regard in the earlier debate on corporation tax and business rates as a result of his comments and use of figures we have in the past week seen efforts to try to bolster the case for reducing the rate back to 40p i note that the government have not explicitly ruled out such a change we know from the government\u2019s own assessment that the cost of cutting the rate from 50p to 45p was more than \u00a33 billion excluding all behavioural changes given that the sum is so large how does one justify the tax cut the government say that most of that potential \u00a33 billion revenue would effectively be lost as a result of tax avoidance once they have assessed revenue lost as a result of tax avoidance and other behavioural change the government go on to say that the cost to the exchequer is only \u00a3100 million that implies that this is a neat and exact science but nothing could be further from the truth ", "i will come on to the point about tax avoidance one option open to the government to protect revenue from the 50p rate was to do more on tax avoidance this is a government who like to trumpet their record on tax avoidance but they certainly ducked the opportunity when it came to dealing with potential avoidance in relation to the 50p rate ", "i will not because of a lack of time the hmrc report says that all the analysis and estimation is highly uncertain as does the institute for fiscal studies the scale of behavioural change is ultimately decided by ministers and it is primarily based on anassessment of taxable income elasticity tie the ifs says that there is a huge margin for error staying within that margin one could easily say that depending on the tie cutting the rate could cost \u00a3700 million or could raise \u00a3600 million that gives us an idea of the range of figures that we are talking about and how uncertain the projections are it might have fitted the government narrative for them to imply that they knew for certain that the 50p rate would raise only \u00a3100 million but even on their figures and hmrc\u2019s report there is a huge margin for error and this is all very uncertain that is not the only thing that was wrong with the analysis the hmrc report was based on only one year\u2019s worth of data the data related to 2010-11 which is a weakness in itself it came too early given the history of the introduction of the rate and the government\u2019s decision to cut it the reliance on year one is a further weakness in the government\u2019s argument because we know that incomes were taken earlier to avoid the 50p rate and as a result incomes in 2010 and 2011 were artificially lower suggesting a lower yield hence our request for a review the original hmrc analysis does not give a true picture was done too soon after the rate had been introduced and was based on only one year\u2019s worth of data income figures for that year were lower than otherwise might have been the case because people brought their income forward to 2009-10 before the rate came into effect no one has redone the analysis so we are still going on the figures from the 2012 budget the government should at the very least update the analysis based on the more recent data and prepare the report that our amendment and new clause 4 call for a comparison of 45p and 50p rates for those on incomes over \u00a3150 000 and \u00a31 million would be instructive to the public debate about the top rate especially as some members on the government back benches want to reduce the rate to 40p ", "our analysis was based on projections that were available to us at that time and on those projections that analysis was correct the truth is that everyone accepts that all analysis in relation to the 50p rate hmrc\u2019s analysis and everyone else\u2019s is uncertain because we did not have the rate in place for long enough to make a full and thorough assessment now hmrc has available to it records for the following two years when the 50p rate was in place and it could update the report that was used for budget 2012 that would give a much clearer picture to all of us who are relying on other figures and forecasts just as people shifted income into 2009 and 2010 to avoid the 50p rate when it was introduced once the chancellor had said in his 2012 budget that he wouldabolish it the following year in 2013 unsurprisingly people effectively decided to delay their bonuses and income until the new tax year 2013-14 began so that they could avoid paying 50p and pay 45p instead that is what accounts for the revenue from 45p being higher which in our earlier debates government members sought to rely on in support of cutting the rate further to 40p the government clearly reward tax avoidance at 50p with a tax cut to 45p and their back benchers are now calling for 40p on the basis of revenue that they know is inflated owing to income shifting which may well have cost the treasury millions in lost revenue warped priorities if ever there was a case of them the chancellor is on record as saying that he considers tax avoidance to be  morally repugnant but as i have just said he has rewarded a particular form of tax avoidance with a tax cut i wonder if that has ever happened for people on middle and lower incomes i think not this is a government who always tell us how proud they are of their record on tax avoidance but i wonder how much effort they put into thinking of ways in which they could protect revenue from the 50p rate the government have introduced the general anti-abuse rule the gaar which may have helped they could have thought about a targeted rule they could have looked to hmrc to do more i understand that no specific measures are taken within hmrc to protect revenue from the 50p rate before rushing to abolish the rate the government could and should have looked at protecting revenue first the truth is that there was no justification for giving a huge tax cut to the richest in our country bonuses we now know are up by 83% for those in the financial sector while ordinary people are worse off now and will be worse off in 2015 compared with 2012 that certainly makes a mockery of the now not very often repeated phrase  we are all in it together i think the government have been hoping that if they keep going on about the increase in the personal allowance people will forget that they have made a political decision a political choice and a political priority to cut taxes for the richest in our country the truth is that the government have given with one hand and taken away much more with the other as i said if one looks at wages ordinary people are \u00a31 600 a year worse off and the combined effect of tax and benefit changes means that households will on average be \u00a3970 a year worse off this cut to the 50p rate cannot be justified at a time when the deficit is high and will not be eliminated towards the end of the next parliament labour in government will increase the rate back to 50p to help us to get the deficit down in a fairer way just as we have said that we want the obr to have powers to audit manifestos ahead of the next general election because we believe that scrutiny will add to public understanding about the choices that are being made so too we think that a review as envisaged in our amendment would help the public to understand the impact of the top rate of tax so that they can make up their own minds about who is standing up for them and other working people like them therefore we will press amendment 4 to a vote ", "the exchequer secretary speaks about a positive business environment business rates have increased by \u00a31 500 on average since his government have been in power does he think that that has led to a positive business environment for those businesses affected ", "we have had a very good and interesting debate i was a little horrified when the right hon member for wokingham (mr redwood) began his remarks by making what sounded almost like positive comments about me but he very quickly moved on to comments that better reflected both his politics and mine he raised a point that i did not hear clearly but i am sure it was a withering put-down about me not doing my homework on his criticisms of both the amendment and what it seeks to achieve i say to him as gently as possible that if he had done his homework he would know that the opposition are somewhat constrained in the amendments we can table to finance bills and the impact they could have on the exchequer so often the best way for us to get a good debate on what we seek to achieve is through asking for a review i hope that that settles his mind as to the nature of our amendment there has been a great deal of discussion today about our proposals to increase the headline rate of corporation tax from 20% to 21% we would use every penny of the revenue from that tax increase to cut business rates for small businesses in 2015 and to freeze them the year after nothing that government members have said today has shown that they understand the true impact that business rates are having on small businesses up and down the country the government are not prepared to make choices or spending switches to support those small businesses but that is what the next labour government will do in 2015 we intend to press our amendment to a vote ", "i agree that business needs certainty all our figures are based on analysis from the house of commons library that is the best we have to go on and it is of course a respected source for making projections on the likely cost of cutting the rate and how much will remain for business rates as i have said all the money raised will go towards our business rate policy which applies to 2015-16 and 2016-17 we will of course consider the circumstances in the early part of the next parliament when deciding what to do about business rates during the budget debates government members tried to argue that our proposal to increase corporation tax back up to 21% meant that labour was all about increasing business taxes it is interesting that that argument has not been repeated since those debates it quickly fell apart when it was pointed out to government members that given that all the revenue from our corporation tax policy would be spent on cutting and then freezing business rates for small businesses their argument did not seem to consider small businesses to be real businesses i am glad that government members appear to have dropped that particular line of attack and i would warn them against trying to run it again because it was insulting to small and medium-sized enterprises ", "our policy is fully costed we do not envisage any loss of revenue for local government our key priority is to give practical assistance to businesses as soon as possible so that people such as those who visit my constituency surgery to say that they are fearful that they will have to close their business get some relief from what is becoming a very real business burden last week the secretary of state for education suggested to the british chambers of commerce that our policy on corporation tax and business rates pits businesses against each other which is complete nonsense the idea is not to tell one business that it is going to suffer while another business does really well it is to get a better balance with regard to the landscape of business taxation as i have set out in detail corporation tax cuts over the life of this parliament amount to some \u00a310 billion and 2% of businesses in this country have done very well with their tax bill it is fair and right to consider what is happening to the other 98% understand thestruggles they face and make choices that the 2% might not like but that will offer support to smaller businesses and that will go some way to ensuring that they can remain in business and continue to grow and do good for the economy even if the headline rate of corporation tax increases from 20% to 21% it is important to remember that it will remain competitive i do not believe that the change would be destructive or damaging to uk plc in fact i think that it and the moneys that will go to businesses as a result of a cut and then a freeze in business rates could do real good not just for smes but for the economy as a whole ", "i am really disappointed that the hon gentleman has not been listening to my speech at what point did i bash big businesses it was not something i said and nor was it suggested by my tone i have made it very clear that we supported the cuts to corporation tax in this parliament we are simply suggesting a switch spend it will be in our manifesto for the next general election which amounts to making a different choice on corporation tax in order to get practical and immediate help to smaller businesses that will make a real difference to them given that the 2% of businesses that are larger have benefited by about \u00a310 billion over the life of this parliament as a result of a number of changes to their taxation it is fair to switch our attention to a part of the business market that has been rather ignored although the government have a number of schemes to help smaller businesses those schemes are not going far enough or achieving the government\u2019s aims our suggested switch spend is fair it is not about pitting one business against another or valuing one above another it is a simple recognition of the fact that 98% of businesses in this country have not received the practical help they need they are desperate for change on their business rates and we will deliver it the policy will be in our next manifesto ", "what i primarily regret is that as a result of the choices they made this government choked off the economic recovery that was under way when they came to office that is the most regrettable thing it led to three damaging years of flatlining and it is ordinary people who are paying the price following a vocal campaign by a number of business groups ahead of the autumn statement the government decided not to go ahead with the planned 3 2% increase in business rates and decided instead to cap them at 2% the government also announced in the autumn statement that they would provide additional help to retailers that was action it was relatively late in the day but it was action but it does not go far enough and the government\u2019s policy does not compare favourably with ours ahead of the next general election ultimately business rates are still set to rise this month by an average of \u00a3270 the government\u2019s autumn statement offer of \u00a31 000 business rate relief was welcome for retailers but it excluded workshops and offices used by high-tech start-ups i particularly have in mind small jewellery makers in my constituency which is famous for the jewellery quarter at its heart such businesses will not benefit from the government\u2019s announcements in the autumn statement and as i have said a significant rise in business rates is still envisaged for small businesses our proposal for a switch spend from corporation tax to business rates is a much more comprehensive measure that would offer genuine and more far-reaching support to small and medium-sized enterprises given the scale of the problem our policy seeks to offer practical help that would truly make a difference on the witton road the coventry road and the soho road in my constituency the exchequer secretary will be pleased to know that it would also make a difference in his constituency the office for national statistics report  uk business activity size and location 2013 a great read tells us that more than 80% of the 5 750 vat or paye-based enterprises in south west hertfordshire employ no more than four people while almost 75% of them have a turnover of less than \u00a3250 000 they are therefore not affected by the changes to the main rate of corporation tax which he himself oversees they are more likely to be in properties with a rental value of \u00a350 000 and are therefore more likely to benefit from labour\u2019s proposal to cut and then freeze business rates in 2015-16 in conclusion we believe that our policy is the right one for helping small businesses it meets the scale of the challenge that they face on business rates and it makes the right choice about how to pay for the policy we will want to vote on our amendment later this afternoon to highlight the impact of this government\u2019s decisions and the imbalances in their approach ", "the hon gentleman is welcome to see our detailed calculations which i can provide to him and are a matter of public record if he really wants auditing of manifesto commitments he should support our call for the office for budget responsibility to be allowed to audit parties\u2019 manifestos we have nothing to hide on the policies that we have announced and the numbers behind them we are very happy for the obr to look at all that and to prepare a report for the benefit of the public so that they can see that what we are saying is based on good numbers and is deliverable if the government both parts of the government have nothing to hide they should fully support our proposal on the obr audit which is a good one i am glad that the hon gentleman has given me a chance to remind the house that it is not labour members who are scared to have their numbers looked at ", "i will not give way i am going to make a little more progress as hon members will know the level of business rates is set by the treasury although the revenues are collected locally business rates increase with inflation and the rate of increase each april is set according to the rate of retail prices index inflation in the previous september in september 2013 rpi was 3 2% so business rates were due to rise by 3 2% this year of course that was before the government made their autumn statement announcement which capped that increase at 2% business rates have risen rapidly during this parliament because of high inflation more than one in 10 small businesses now say that they spend the same or more on business rates as on rent this april businesses have been hit by a rise of \u00a3270 on average at a total cost to business of \u00a345 million ", "i hear the hon gentleman\u2019s point which i will come to later in my remarks on the action that the government have taken in the round he will not be surprised to hear that my criticism is that it does not go far enough by comparison our alternative proposal which is a labour manifesto commitment goes much further and would result in a cut in business rates and a freeze the following year the only choice for many shops workshops start-up businesses and others who pay business rates is to pass the increases on to their customers primarily through higher prices which of course makes things difficult for those customers they also face a continuing squeeze which many of them complain means that they can no longer afford to stay in business this is having a real impact as i know from my casework in my constituency surgery i have met many constituents with family-owned businesses whose stories are not dissimilar to the story of my own family whose elder relatives came to this country in the \u201960s and \u201970s and set up businesses that they have passed on to their children and in some cases grandchildren they are now terrified that the squeeze from the exponential growth in business rates might put their family-owned businesses out of business i have seen constituents break down because every time the business rates bill comes they fear that many years of hard work which is tied absolutely to their conception of what it is to be british and to enjoy the freedoms offered by this country might be going down the drain given how much businesses are struggling and given the collection of issues that smes are facing we have said that the next labour government would cut business rates in 2015 and then freeze them in 2016 in 2015 we would cut business rates on properties with an annual rental value of less than \u00a350 000 taking the rates backto the level of the previous year and then freeze them for such properties in 2016 as we have said we would pay for that by reversing the additional cut in the main rate of corporation tax due to go ahead next year when it will fall from 21% to 20% the main rate is paid by companies with profits of over \u00a31 5 million while companies with profits between \u00a3300 000 and \u00a31 5 million pay the rate on a sliding scale and companies with profits of less than \u00a3300 000 which pay the lower rate will be unaffected by the cut all the money raised from the corporation tax increase that we envisage that is a rise from 20% back up to 21% would be spent solely and exclusively on paying for our policy on business rates that is an important point given some of the debate that has taken place in the house in the past week or two when we have been speaking about the budget and attitudes towards business taxation even at 21% our corporation tax rate would remain competitive being second lowest in the g8 and second lowest in the g20 government members often say that any corporation tax rise will have a negative impact on our country\u2019s capacity to do business but i disagree because as i said even at 21% it will be the second lowest in the g8 and the g20 the headline rate of corporation tax is not the sole reason that businesses choose to come to this country to invest and create jobs it is an important factor no one can deny that but it is part of a picture of support for business that those wishing to come to this country look at or are advised on before they make their decisions i do not believe that putting corporation tax back up from 20% to 21% would have too great an impact on our capacity to attract businesses to this country ", "i do not think it does send that message business people are much more sophisticated than that they do not simply look at announcements about the headline rate they will receive advice from their advisers their accountants and lawyers when they are making their decisions about where to base themselves and where to go to invest and grow their companies it will be explained to them and known to them that this policy is designed to support a different type of business that benefits all of us who are interested in the business landscape we have been very clear that this is the only change to corporation tax that we envisage during the next parliament and that we are doing this not because we want to put people off coming to this country or prevent them from doing so but because we want to use all the money to pay for a cut and then a freeze in business rates we have also said very clearly that any choices we make that differ from what the government are doing will be fully costed and fully funded as i said we are happy for the obr to look at our figures and audit our manifesto and to do so for all political parties ahead of the next general election to make sure that the public are as well informed as possible about the different choices being made by parties that want to be in government ", "i assure the hon gentleman that labour members are passionate about business and our policy of a business rates cut for small and medium-sized businesses which i will come to later the government\u2019s impact assessment says that the 1% cut in 2015 will lower the bills of 40 000 businesses that have profits of more than \u00a31 5 million and pay the main rate of corporation tax it will also benefit a further 41 000 businesses that have profits between \u00a3300 000 and \u00a31 5 million and pay the main rate of corporation tax but receive marginal relief the department for business innovation and skills estimates that the uk has 4 8 million private sector businesses the majority of which around 3 6 million are sole proprietorships and a further 1 02 million have fewer than 10 employees that means that if 81 000 businesses benefit from cuts to the main rate of corporation tax fewer than 2% of the total businesses in the uk are benefiting ", "i will come to the point about the different tax choices that we make and measuring their impact unlike the minister i do not have access to treasury officials so i am not versed in their methodology but i do not deny that the government\u2019s corporation tax rate cuts in this parliament which we have supported have benefited 2% of businesses i will come later to the 98% of businesses that have not benefited from the cuts to the main rate of corporation tax but which are struggling with the costs of running their business the opposition believe that the governmentcan and should go further in helping those businesses cope in particular with the business rates that they have seen increase ", "i will come to the government\u2019s record in helping small and medium-sized enterprises as i said we have supported the reduction in the rate of corporation tax in this parliament except to raise concerns which i am sure the exchequer secretary will remember well before i was in my current post about the financing of that change at the start of the parliament by getting rid of investment allowances on which the government have recently u-turned but as the figures show the change to the main rate of corporation tax the central policy for business taxation does not help 98% of business in this country how are they faring under this government everyone agrees that smes are the engine of growth a phrase that we hear regularly in the chamber and the house and it is also fair to say that they are the part of our national life high streets and corner shops are part of the very british way of life that we enjoy in this country i have a personal affinity with these enterprises as when i was younger my parents had a corner shop my first job was helping my parents by serving customers in our shop after school and at weekends doing the stock-take and going with my dad to the cash-and-carry even if one did not grow up in such a business they are easy to call to mind because there are so many of them as i said there are almost 5 million and they are the heart and soul of our villages towns and cities they also provide about 47% of private sector jobs as for everyone smes are no different times have been tough and smes have been struggling with a number of issues during this parliament and i will come to the points raised by the hon gentleman the first of those issues has been access to finance every time we discuss smes access to finance is one of the key issues raised it is fair to say that the government have failed to get lending going to businesses they are in their fourth year of office and their many schemes keep failing to have a significant and game-changing impact on the access to finance landscape for example business lending fell towards the end of last year as banks continued to squeeze funding for smes despite attempts by the bank of england to boost finance to the sector bank lending figures also show that businesses paid back \u00a34 3 billion more than they had borrowed in the three months to the end of november smes were the worst affected by that particular brake on lending and that is despite the tweaks to the funding for lending scheme announced by the bank that were designed to try to ensure that loans to smaller businesses would be favoured although larger businesses can access the growing market for debt financing in the bond market there is a problem for small businesses that are reliant on high street banks and specialist finance and lending businesses which have become much more conservative in their lending practices since the global financial crash of2008 smes have consistently reported that credit is either refused or offered at very high prices by the major lenders as members on both sides of the house must regularly hear from businesses in their constituencies there has been much talk in this parliament about the problems of access to finance for smes but despite several different schemes being announced the change in practices that is required if smes are to have the finance they need has not been seen that issue has also been considered by the public accounts committee which made a number of worrying findings in relation to the landscape for smes it said the departments\u2019 schemes are managed as a series of ad hoc initiatives that are launched to address particular weaknesses in the market rather than to act as a coherent programme that is a real problem the lack of a coherent programme from the government despite what i am sure are the best efforts of the business secretary and the chancellor has led to piecemeal action a little bit here and a little bit there but no overall drive to action only some good rhetoric for set-piece debates in the chamber leading to not very much at all ", "as i set out the issue is not just the risk taken by the banks which have been very conservative in providing smes with access to finance members in all parts of the house accept that good businesses that have the capacity to grow create more jobs and be successful are failing to get the finance they need in my constituency a number of successful viable businesses are still failing to get finance from the banks that is not a result of banks being a little bit conservative in their risk taking they have significantly curtailed their lending which is having a negative impact on smes and their capacity to grow and increase jobs the public accounts committee also found that investment overall had declined and that government departments could not demonstrate whether their schemes had addressed the market failures that they had been set up to correct there was no mechanism the committee said for evaluation of the various schemes and no obvious goals were set for the schemes making it easier for the government to hide any failures goal setting of the kind envisaged by the public accounts committee would make the failure of such schemes much starker but would also lead to greater and quicker action to correct them and ensure that desperately needed finance reached smes an additional problem in the government\u2019s approach according to the public accounts committee i think we can all agree on this is the difficulty of raising awareness of the schemes available for smes which are often small operations one-man or one-woman bands it is difficult to balance all the responsibilities of running a business and often people do not have the time to engage with government policy and how it affects them they may hear about schemes randomly and it is not always easy to learn from government websites what is available for small businesses the public accounts committee felt strongly that the government lacked a clear strategy to ensure that smes were aware of the funding options available to them i noted at the weekend that the employment allowance introduced by the government has been rolled out millions of letters have been written to businesses to make them aware of the \u00a32 000 allowance that has come into effect that goes to show the extent of the awareness raising that is required i am sure that there was also a political advantage and motive to the writing of those letters writing to businesses telling them what change has occurred and how they might benefit is a good thing but it shows the effort required to get the message out such effort was not necessarily apparent in the case of other government schemes relating to access to finance ", "i assure the hon gentleman that it is not a matter of my personal disappointment the government have announced a number of schemes which everyone agrees have failed to get lending to the rate that is necessary to have a game-changing effect on the landscape for small and medium-sized enterprises the employment allowance which we supported the hon gentleman served on the relevant bill committee came after the national insurance contributions regional holiday a scheme that was in place for three years and almost from day one failed to meet the ambitious targets that the government set for themselves throughout the life of that scheme we called on the government to change course which they did not do until the scheme came to the end of its three years at which point they introduced the employment allowance the employment allowance will help smes and has been welcomed by them but it has come late in the day we are in the last year of this parliament the government could easily have accepted the failure of the nics regional holiday scheme and perhaps introduced the employment allowance earlier we debated that at length some months ago when we were discussing the bill that brought in the employment allowance where they have changed course the government have done so late in the day and where they have not changed course their schemes are still not having the booster effect that is needed for access to finance for smes the second area in which smes are struggling is exports the government set themselves an ambitious target for the increase in exports that they wanted to see by 2020 but we now know that the government\u2019s two flagship export schemes for businesses announced a couple of years ago are yet to help a single firm the \u00a35 billion exports refinancing scheme was launched injuly 2012 as part of the treasury\u2019s uk exports guarantee scheme at the time ministers claimed it would be up and running by the end of 2012 but answers to parliamentary questions reveal that it has not helped a single business and is not yet operational the government\u2019s \u00a31 5 billion direct lending scheme launched seven months ago has not helped a single firm either so far 15 inquiries have been received and just one firm has put in an application for support under the scheme which was first announced in the 2012 autumn statement both programmes were supposed to help more firms export following the failure of the government\u2019s previous flagship programme designed for the purpose the export enterprise finance guarantee scheme was abandoned by ministers after it emerged that it had assisted only five firms we know that last year uk export finance spent less than a fifth of the \u00a325 billion of financial support made available to businesses more than \u00a320 billion was left gathering dust in the government\u2019s coffers when this record was brought to light a government spokesman said that steps were announced in the budget to make both programmes more accessible to small businesses and that the changes would help firms to  realise their export potential but the verdict of the institute for fiscal studies was that they were relatively small and are unlikely to make a substantial difference to the weak performance of uk investment and exports media reports have suggested that civil servants are privately admitting that the government\u2019s promise to get 100 000 new companies primarily small firms exporting by the end of the decade is not going to happen smes have real problems in accessing finance and exporting they are also struggling with energy prices this is a topic on which there has been a great deal of debate in the chamber over recent weeks we know that energy prices are a problem for businesses as much as for families our proposals for an energy price freeze would save the average business more than \u00a35 000 in the meantime energy prices continue to impose a burden on smes ", "i beg to move amendment 2 page\u00a03 \u00a0line\u00a028 \u00a0at end insert \u2018( ) the chancellor of the exchequer shall undertake a review within six months of the passing of this act on the impact of an additional cut of one per cent to the main rate of corporation tax for financial year 2015-16 with particular reference to (a) the impact on businesses with fewer than 50 employees (b) the impact on investment by businesses with fewer than 50 employees and(c) alternative tax measures including non-domestic rates which would have a greater benefit for businesses with fewer than 50 employees ( ) the chancellor of the exchequer must publish the report of the review and lay the report before the house \u2019 this amendment would require the chancellor of the exchequer to publish a report on the impact of a cut of one per cent to main rate corporation tax on businesses including small and medium sized enterprises (smes) ", "our amendment would require the chancellor to publish a review of the impact of an additional cut of 1% to the main rate of corporation tax for 2015-16 with reference to the impact on businesses with fewer than 50 employees their levels of investment and the impact of alternative tax measures such as a reduction in non-domestic rates business rates which we believe would have a greater impact on small and medium-sized enterprises which tend to be businesses that have fewer employees and in the main occupy premises with a rateable value of less than \u00a350 000 our amendment and our approach highlight the difference between us and the government when it comes to business taxation the government have made a number of significant cuts to corporation tax the main rate has been cut a number of times and is due to be cut again from 21% to 20% next year the main rateis paid by companies with profits of more than \u00a31 5 million about 40 000 or so businesses the small profits rate is paid by companies with profits of under \u00a3300 000 and there is a marginal rate which applies to companies with profits between \u00a3300 000 and \u00a31 5 million the government have announced cuts to the corporation tax rate in almost every fiscal event that we have had since 2010 with the rate falling from 28% in 2010 to 20% in 2015-16 this has brought the uk rate lower than most developed economies as i said the government are planning another cut for april 2015 from 21% to 20% at a cost of \u00a3400 million in 2015-16 rising to \u00a3785 million the following year and \u00a3865 million the year after that the cumulative corporation tax cut over this parliament has been in the region of \u00a310 billion the government\u2019s central argument for cutting corporation tax is that a lower rate makes the uk more attractive as a destination for businesses to locate they claim that a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax will reduce capital costs for businesses and promote higher levels of business investment ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation and skills which trades unions are involved with health and safety committees in his department ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation and skills what health and safety committees operate in his department ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer how many (a) civil servants and (b) part-time private sector secondees have worked or are expected to work at the office of tax simplification during (i) 2010-11 (ii) 2011-12 (iii) 2012-13 and (iv) 2013-14 ", "will the exchequer secretary take the opportunity to do what none of his colleagues in the treasury team has done in particular the chief secretary refused to answer this question in debates on the budget when all is said and done will people be better off or worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 it is a straight question a straight answer please ", "we have had an interesting debate today which has made stark the difference between the opposition\u2019s priorities and those of government members the finance bill is thick and heavy but it is pretty light on content that is relevant to the working person on a modest income my hon friends have made some powerful and persuasive speeches highlighting precisely that point my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south (bridget phillipson) spoke with passion about how her region was suffering as a result of the government\u2019s polices and drew attention to the imbalance in the recovery that they have delivered my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth (stephen doughty) spoke in particular about business rates and the success of the jobs growth programme being run by the welsh labour government whom this government like to bash at any opportunity but who are having some real success on jobs in wales my hon friend the member for bolton west (julie hilling) made a particularly powerful point she reminded the house that the chancellor said that this is a budget for makers doers and savers but she said that it has nothing in it for those who are making do my hon friend also reminded us of the tragedy of zero-hours contracts she gave a powerful example of a constituent who was sanctioned under dwp rules for leaving a job that gave him zero hours of work it was a tragedy for the individual concerned but it also shows how iniquitous the rules are in practice ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention i very much welcome the government\u2019s u-turn on investment allowances which we warned were a mistake in 2010 it is really good that the chancellor has finally decided at the tail end of this parliament to put right that bad decision my hon friend the member for glasgow north east (mr bain) reminded the house of two anniversaries 15 years ago today the national minimum wage came into effect and a year ago today the government introduced the bedroom tax that is a clear example of the big differences in the values and priorities of those on the opposition and on the government side my hon friend the member for north durham (mr jones) spoke for some time although not at his usual length about the things that are missing from the bill he focused on the detail of the pension changes which we will scrutinise especially in relation to social care costs which he was right to highlight my hon friend the member for edinburgh east (sheila gilmore) spoke of how some savers will benefit as a result of the government\u2019s measures but for many people saving is a luxury that is far out of reach my hon friend the member for gateshead (ian mearns) reminded the house of the imbalance of the recovery and how the north-east continues to suffer he also made a point that no one made today in relation to the local government cuts which are only just starting to bite and will further embed the regional imbalance in our country people are looking to this government to take action to help them in the here and now i am talking about the people who elected us to make decisions on their behalf those people are on average \u00a31 600 a year worse off since this government came to power they will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 even if we take into account the combined effect of tax and benefit changes they will still be \u00a3900 a year worse off for those government members who are not sure what that really means i will explain that \u00a31 600 is about half the cost of the uniform required for membership of the bullingdon club for residents of inner-city birmingham which i represent it is about three months\u2019 rent those people are working harder and harder for less and less and they are looking for help in the here and now to make sure that at the end of the working week or month they have earned enough money to pay the rent put food on the table and clothe their family but this finance bill contains no such help the fact that people are worse off and have to spend more on everyday essentials seems not to exist according to the bill it is as if all government front benchers have been caught in some kind of existential trance if they cannot see or feel the cost of living crisis it cannot exist even if it exists it cannot be communicated to others and even if it can be communicated it simply cannot be understood the people who are \u00a31 600 a year a worse off need help in the here and now this bill could have done that it does not this government could have done that they did not where was the action to help working parents and families we know that nursery costs have gone up by 30% since 2010 a parent working full time on the living wage with one child in nursery care will not see a penny of income until the beginning of the third week of the month that is truly shocking what do the government offer they offer help after the next general election but nothing in this bill why did they not take the opportunity in part 2 of the bill to raise more money from the bank levy to fund an expansion of free child care for working parents of three and four-year olds from the current 15 hours to 25 hours that would be real help we will scrutinise the detail of the relevant clauses in committee in opening my hon friend the shadow chief secretary to the treasury referred to an article from thedaily telegraph which is not often helpful to the opposition however it has recently reported concerns that the government\u2019s planned changes to the bank levy might amount to a tax cut for the banks the government arenot shouting that from the rooftops but there are suggestions that some banks will pay \u00a3300 million less we will need to see the detail and to press the minister on that point in committee it is a real embarrassment for the exchequer secretary that his projections on how much the bank levy would raise were so far off earlier he ducked the opportunity to explain that i would happily give way to him now if he was willing to explain but he does not want to no matter we will return to the matter at length when we are locked together in a committee room debating these issues on government changes that might end up helping the banks pay less i should also mention the small matter of the schedule 19 charge in fairly impenetrable and hidden-away language the government seem to have given a \u00a3145 million tax cut for investment managers whose industry is frankly doing rather well at the moment it could have been asked to forgo that tax cut given that the poorest and most vulnerable in our society continue to suffer that shows the government\u2019s priorities ", "i will not for the moment i will make some more progress [interruption ]", "thank you madam deputy speaker i am not surprised that government members do not want to hear about their secret \u00a3145 million tax cut for investment managers ", "i will not give way for now instead the government\u2019s priority has been the married couple\u2019s tax allowance hardly the here and now help clamoured for outside the westminster village what does it amount to in practice it totals \u00a33 80 for the couples who qualify at a cost to the exchequer of \u00a3500 million i note that earlier the chief secretary to the treasury refused an opportunity to stand at the dispatch box and confirm his support for the measure it does not look as if he wants to do that now his silence says all that needs to be said the policy is slightly random it excludes widows widowers and people living on their own for the sake of outcomes that are far from clear it will help just one third of married couples 84% of the gainers will be men and just one in six families with children will benefit what about the rest there is nothing in the here and now for them either what could the government have done for starters they could have scrapped the married couple\u2019s tax allowance and brought in a lower 10p starting rate of tax which we have called for and which would help 24 million taxpayers including 12 million people who are married and almost half of whom 46% would be women ", "i will give way to the hon gentleman if he will confirm that a 10p starting rate of tax 46% of whose beneficiaries would be women is better than a policy 84% of whose beneficiaries would be men ", "yet after all that action this chancellor and this government have given with one hand and taken away a hell of a lot more with the other the hon gentleman knows that is true he also knows that people will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 which says everything we need to know about this government\u2019s priorities what is there for young people long-term youth unemployment has doubled under this government and 900 000 young people are out of work what is there in the here and now in this bill to help them not much the chancellor spoke yesterday of full employment but where are the policies that would make that happen the number of young people out of work for one year or more has almost doubled under this chancellor and what this government have delivered the work programme has returned more people to the jobcentre than have been found new work while only 5% of disabled people have been helped to find a job the hon member for dover (charlie elphicke) who is not in his place cited the welcome decrease in long-term youth unemployment in birmingham ladywood he is not aware though that birmingham\u2019s labour-run council administration has introduced a scheme called the birmingham jobs fund based on the labour government\u2019s future jobs fund specifically to tackle youth unemployment that is why we have seen a decrease in long-term youth unemployment in my constituency and in other birmingham constituencies although he might not have meant to congratulate my colleagues at birmingham city council i shall certainly pass his congratulations on to them where was the help for small businesses the backbone of economic growth in this country who are crying out for extra support we have said that instead of going ahead with the additional 1% cut in corporation tax the government should use that money to cut and then freeze business rates so that small and medium-sized enterprises can get some real help now during last week\u2019s debate on the charter for budget responsibility the government tried to portray labour\u2019s policy as an anti-business proposal that would increase business taxes but when it was pointed out to them that that argument flies only if one considers small businesses not to be real businesses they seemed to change tack today the secretary of state for education tried to posit it as setting one set of businesses against the other but that totally and utterly misses the point our proposal would use all the money saved by not going ahead with the corporation tax cut for the largest companies to support small businesses at 21% thecorporation tax rate would remain competitive but that switch in spending would strike a better and fairer balance business rates have already gone up by an average of \u00a31 500 under this government and many businesses including more than one in 10 small businesses are now paying more in business rates than in rent unless things change business rates will have risen by an average of nearly \u00a32 000 by the end of this parliament this government have failed to help small businesses and so the next labour government would cut business rates in 2015 and freeze them in 2016 ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point his experience as a constituency mp is exactly the same as mine almost every business that comes to see me at my surgery is struggling with its business rates and energy costs what does the bill say about the top rate of income tax well it remains at 45p this government have given an average tax cut of more than \u00a3107 000 to the 8 000 millionaires in our country they seem to think that if they keep talking about the increase in the personal allowance they will make people forget that the combined impact of the tax and benefit changes is that a typical household is \u00a3900 a year worse off and that the richest in our country are getting an absolutely huge tax cut the government are desperate to be able to claim that the 50p rate raised as little money as possible because they want to make it easier for themselves to justify their decision to give a tax cut to the wealthiest at a time when ordinary families are really struggling the government\u2019s own assessment claims that the cost of cutting the rate to 45p excluding all behavioural changes was over \u00a33 billion to justify the tax cut they argued that most of the potential revenue would be lost as a result of tax avoidance government members were very excitable about the government\u2019s record on tax avoidance which i will come to in a moment but surely a government as proud as they are of that record would have taken some targeted anti-avoidance measures to stop people avoiding the 50p rate instead they ducked the opportunity the government also claim that tax revenues rose after they cut the top rate of tax but both the office for national statistics and the obr have said that many of the highest earners moved their income and delayed their bonuses by a year after the 2012 budget to benefit from the lower top rate of tax that shifting of income will have cost the treasury millions of pounds in lost revenue when the deficit is high it cannot be right to cut the top rate of tax the next labour government will put that rate back to 50p while we get the deficit down there was some excitement on the government benches about the government\u2019s record on tax avoidance although they like to pretend that that record is strong it is nothing to write home about the dotas disclosure of tax avoidance schemes measures were introducedby a labour government in 2004 every time government members stand up and take credit for those measures i shall pass on their thanks to the previous labour administration who introduced them the government have made a number of assumptions in their calculations of the value to the exchequer of extending the accelerated payment scheme to both dotas and the general anti-abuse rule although hmrc is successful in about 80% of the cases it litigates i find it hard to see why the same 80% success rate has been applied to potential cases under the gaar when a case on the gaar has yet to go to court we will scrutinise the government\u2019s numbers in committee they have a history of overestimating the impact of their avoidance measures we have spoken a lot today about the swiss deal which raised \u00a32 3 billion less than expected i am sure that the exchequer secretary will not [interruption ]", "thank you madam deputy speaker i will bring my remarks to a conclusion but i want to give the exchequer secretary an opportunity to intervene and explain to the house why he got the numbers so wrong on the swiss tax deal he is shaking his head which implies to me that he is not prepared to stand up for his own record or admit that he has a history of overestimating his numbers we will look at the numbers closely in committee the government had an opportunity with the bill to provide help in the here and now that is an opportunity they have failed to take we will be voting against the bill and in favour of our reasoned amendment which lists the measures that we believe are necessary to tackle the cost of living crisis and make sure that people on lower and middle incomes start to see the benefits of recovery we will seek to improve the bill in committee and try to persuade the government to change course but from what we have heard today and what we are no doubt about to hear from the exchequer secretary i fear that the government are so blind to the lives of ordinary working people that they will refuse to take the opportunity to do so ", "the financial secretary is talking about facts so will he confirm one fact that his colleague the chief secretary to the treasury failed to confirm yesterday which is that working people are \u00a31 600 a year worse off under this government and that they will be worse off in 2015 than they were in 2010 ", "what is clear from the debate we have had today and the budget statement we heard yesterday is that this government are hopelessly out of touch there was no mention from government members either yesterday or today of the central fact that after four years of this government ordinary working people are \u00a31 600 a year worse off the chancellor said yesterday that his budget was for doers makers and savers well it might help some doers some makers and some savers but one would not want to bet the house on it that is because of the government\u2019s record in 2010 he said that he would eliminate the deficit by 2015 but we now know that he does not plan to do that until 2018 the government have borrowed \u00a3190 billion more than they originally planned to indeed they borrowed more in three years than the previous labour government borrowed in 13 years in 2011 the chancellor announced his budget for growth but we saw his growth forecasts revised down in 2012 he said that he would tackle tax avoidance to raise billions of pounds but the uk-swiss tax deal raised only a fraction of the money the government promised the truth is that he is way out on his own forecasts of where he said we would be when he came to power he has failed on the terms he set for himself and it is ordinary people who are paying the price the chancellor would have us believe that his budget will improve the lives of ordinary working people at some point in the not-too-distant future but i am afraid that it is a future that is just out of reach it is not now there is nothing in the budget that will help the ordinary person in the ordinary family in the here and now in the here and now wages are down for the ordinary working person bills are up and the economy will not return to pre-crisis levels until 2017 sure for a doer earning \u00a3150 000 or more or a banker taking a big bonus this is a budget and this is a government for them the chancellor has already given a huge tax cut to people earning over \u00a3150 000 and bankers\u2019 bonuses are rising people earning over \u00a31 million have received a tax cut worth on average \u00a3100 000 butwhat about the rest of the doers the average wage in this country is \u00a326 500 there are no meaningful measures in the budget to help them what is gained by the increase in the personal allowance has already been more than wiped out by the cost of living crisis affecting millions of people across our country the truth is that this chancellor has given with one hand but taken away far more with the other there is nothing in the budget for the millions of hard-working doers up and down our country as for the makers there was some welcome news in the budget but i am afraid that it is a case of far too little far too late on both energy and business investment the chancellor was simply putting right the mistakes that he made in his 2010 budget especially the cut in capital allowances a fact that he conveniently forgot to mention yesterday in 2010 he hit businesses that wanted to invest it is good that he is starting to put that right but it is very late in the day and a lot of damage has already been done to the economy on exports again there were some welcome steps but revised export forecasts show that the chancellor is set to miss his 2020 target in fact the budget suggests that he will not even get half way again his own record does not give us a great deal of hope the government\u2019s export enterprise finance guarantee scheme helped just five firms before it folded and the export refinancing facility was still not operational over a year after it was first announced that is not a record to be proud of on science and research this relates to the discoverers and inventors that the makers of this country rely on once again we saw the government\u2019s characteristic approach a little bit here and a little bit there but nothing in the co-ordinated and planned way that this country\u2019s science community is crying out for there is no long-term science framework as was delivered by the previous labour government and as will be delivered again by the next labour government in 2015 everybody knows that this country\u2019s science research and innovation base which punches well above its weight on the global scale needs a long-term plan for certainty and to build the critical mass from which great innovation occurs but this government have once again failed to deliver it as for savers we will have to look at the detailed proposals but the budget itself shows that the forecast savings ratio has been revised down for every year from 2013 to 2018 so much for a budget to encourage saving this afternoon the institute for fiscal studies has told us that the changes are based on  highly uncertain assumptions and could create people who lose out what of the millions of people in this country in the here and now who cannot save because of the cost of living crisis saving will be a luxury for the hundreds of thousands of people relying on food banks to survive and the tens of thousands of people who are being pushed into debt by the bedroom tax in this debate we have heard many examples of the effects of the government\u2019s failure in powerful contributions from my right hon friend the member for east ham (stephen timms) and my hon friends the members for westminster north (ms buck) for coventry north west (mr robinson) for middlesbrough south and east cleveland (tom blenkinsop) for west bromwich west (mr bailey) for rutherglen and hamilton west (tom greatrex) for luton south (gavin shuker) for feltham and heston (seema malhotra) for makerfield(yvonne fovargue) for plymouth moor view (alison seabeck) for stockton north (alex cunningham) and for croydon north (mr reed) every single labour member spoke of what the government should have addressed in their budget yesterday this budget is yet another missed opportunity to deal with the cost of living crisis ", "the truth is that we have called for a freeze on energy bills which are going up under this government perhaps the government might understand the cost of living crisis better if they had more women on their front bench i notice that once again this afternoon there is not a single female member on the government front bench the cost of living crisis has meant that child care costs have spiralled by 30% since 2010 energy bills are up by almost \u00a3300 since the election with consumers having no way of knowing whether the bills are fair owing to weak competition and poor regulation rent is using up more and more of people\u2019s incomes with rent arrears becoming the fastest growing debt and food prices have risen by over 4% year on year putting a huge squeeze on family finances the government know that this is not about choosing between bringing the deficit down and dealing with the very serious cost of living crisis that is simply a false choice that they choose to hide behind because this budget could have addressed these things labour members have put forward a number of fully costed proposals that would deal with the cost of living crisis and get help to families here and now on child care we would use a levy on banks to provide 25 hours of free child care a week worth \u00a31 500 for working parents with three and four-year-olds the government\u2019s proposals which will not even kick in until after the election will give most benefit to the highest earners who tend to have the highest child care costs on housing we have committed to getting 200 000 homes a year built by 2020 whereas this government have refused to take the action that is needed and are presiding over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s on energy as i said to the hon member for tamworth (christopher pincher) we would freeze energy bills until 2017 and importantly reform the energy market to stop consumers being ripped off we would cut taxes for 24 million working people on middle and low incomes with a lower 10p starting rate of income tax we would put young people back to work with a job for the long-term young unemployed that they had to take paid for by a tax on bankers\u2019 bonuses we would balance the books in a fairer way by reversing the \u00a33 billion tax cut for people earning \u00a3150 000 a year which this government sought to prioritise ahead of any action to help

member for south down (ms ritchie) and the hon members for brighton pavilion (caroline lucas) and for strangford (jim shannon) on securing the debate it has been well attended as proven by the time limit on speeches we have had some brilliant contributions some of which were rather fast-paced as people struggled with the time constraints the debate has served as an important reminder of the importance of tourism to uk plc and we heard some compelling arguments in favour of supporting the tourism sector and for reducing vat to improve the sector\u2019s international competitiveness the hon member for south down opened the debate with a powerful speech her comparison of the uk and the republic of ireland was particularly forceful and she spoke impressively on the potential impact on youth unemployment given the relative youth of those employed by the tourism sector a point that was also expressed by the hon member for brighton pavilion a connected point was made about low pay in the tourism sector so the work force being relatively young is not the only issue i am sure that all hon members will agree that tackling low pay in the sector is important not only for individuals who want to be paid more but for the growth of the economy overall the hon member for totnes (dr wollaston) made me smile when she said that if god were designing the best constituency he would create totnes i would of course argue strongly in favour of birmingham ladywood i was a little worried after her speech that every contribution would turn into a pr pitch for individual constituencies one or two members did indulge in that so we will have to agree to disagree about the relative merits of the places that we represent the hon lady also expressed solidarity and support for those struggling with the floods and i join her in expressing that sentiment people are suffering desperately and we must work together to get them the help that they need and to tackle the long-term issues that have led to the problems the hon member for ceredigion (mr williams) said that his constituency is open for business but the country should also be viewed as such we are a favoured destination for tourists and rank as the seventh most-visited country in the world we hold a unique position in terms of culture heritage and language that makes us a destination of choice regardless of our position on vat and expense we are still well visited and we should continue to reinforce that at every opportunity i will require photographic proof from the hon member for east antrim (sammy wilson) that there is sunshine in his constituency given the horrible weather that we are experiencing at the moment i am interested in the all-party parliamentary group for the uk events industry\u2019s report which was mentioned by the hon member for enfield north (nick de bois) who is the group\u2019s chair and the distinction between leisure and business visitors i will discuss the matter later in my speech i will disappoint hon members today by not making a spending commitment to reduce vat for the tourism sector i apologise for that but i would get into a lot of trouble if i did i acknowledge the passionate views of members present and the strong arguments of the cut tourism vat campaign but the opposition\u2019s stance is that an incoming labour government in 2015 will inherit a difficult financial situation deficit reduction alone does not make for a successful economic policy but it is a necessary and important part of it ", "i am grateful for the hon lady\u2019s intervention and i will in a moment explain why i cannot quite go as far as she would perhaps like although we are determined to build a fairer society and to deliver the long-term changes that our economy needs including rebalancing of which the tourism sector could and should play an important part we must ensure that the sums add up we will therefore not be able to reverse all the cuts and tax rises that this government have pushed through to date but we have had well-documented disagreements with the government over vat although we are too far away from the general election to make detailed commitments across all the areas that may appear in our manifesto we know now that we will face difficult choices the government\u2019s day-to-day spending plans for 2015-16 will be our starting point and we will not borrow any more for such spending any changes to the current spending plans for that year must and will be fully funded that is not only a statement of our current economic policy but an invitation to those involved in the vat campaign perhaps to present some proposals that might work under the tests that we have set for policies come 2015 and i can confirm that my hon friends the members for barnsley central (dan jarvis) and for eltham (clive efford) are already working closely with the tourism sector although i cannot commit to the vat cut that the campaign calls for i can commit to engaging in the conversation and working with the shadow business innovation and skills culture media and sport and treasury teams to examine what else we can do to support the industry and to ensure that it plays its full part in getting us towards sustained economic growth tourism is one of the uk\u2019s biggest employers the sector provides 9% of total jobs and contributes \u00a3134 billion to the economy with revenue increasing by \u00a39 billion last year as i said earlier we are the seventh most-visited country in the world it is important that we continue to engage in the conversation and with the campaign to ensure that we support this vital industry as much as possible one or two members touched on this topic but we have not discussed in detail immigration policy and whether we make ourselves as easy to visit as other countries the visitor visa regime has well-documented concerns for example on this subject i speak not only as a shadow treasury minister but as a former shadow universities and science spokeswoman higher education is our seventh largest export industry and there is tension between the economic benefits which are similar to those of tourism and effective immigration control our regime for visa applications fees and monitoring to avoid over-staying is not the simplest there is particular tension with the countries that we deem to be at risk from where we may expect people with visitor visas to visit with the intention of over-staying countries that have historically been placed in that group such as india can actually be those from which we benefit greatly in tourism for example growing numbers of genuine visitors want to come to this country spend their money and help to boost our economy while having a great time it is important to resolve that tension so that those growth sectors do not suffer unnecessarily and so that we get the maximum benefit from our tourism policy we cannot agree now to the cut that has been called for by campaigners and hon members present for the debate however we are committed to working closely with the sector we will take seriously other help for the sector that does not have cost implications

your chairmanship mr chope i am grateful for the opportunity to hold a debate on a matter that is a growing concern in my constituency and that now accounts for an increasing proportion of my constituency case load as members look ahead to the christmas break this debate is a stark reminder that for a growing number of people in our country christmas and the new year will not be a time to enjoy celebrations with their family and friends in the comfort and security of their own home i was going to set the debate in context by looking at some figures which are obviously worrying and stark but behind every homeless statistic is a story so i thought that i would instead start with the story of one of my constituents whom i met at my advice surgery only a couple of weeks ago she did not want me to give her name or anything that might give her away which i will respect but she came to my surgery with her two daughters one of whom is 15 years old and the other is five or six years old some months ago she had left an abusive relationship with a partner who was prone to fits of rage and had been occasionally violent she eventually found enough courage to decide to leave that relationship but her journey into homelessness then began she and her daughters unfortunately found themselves in temporary bed-and-breakfast accommodation which was not fit for purpose for much longer than the six-week limit the media often talk of councils spending money on premier inns and hotels but the bed and breakfast that this woman and her two daughters were in was frankly disgusting it was mice-infested there was grime everywhere i was struck by the fact that her two daughters\u2019 only request was for somewhere clean to live ", "my hon friend makes an important point and i will come on to the issue that he raises later in my speech my constituent and her two daughters were eventually moved from the awful bed-and-breakfast accommodation temporarily into a small one-bedroom flat which againunfortunately happens to be in a state of disrepair the heating is not working properly and there was an issue with the water supply in the first few days again it is not a particularly clean environment and she of course does not have the means to do it up and make it a comfortable warm secure place for her daughters she is still waiting to be placed in what she hopes will be permanent accommodation and a decent home for herself and her daughters as she was talking to me she expressed how utterly terrified she was when looking ahead to christmas and how the lack of security she felt from the lack of a permanent roof over her and her daughters\u2019 heads was a ball of tension sitting in the pit of stomach that affected her from morning until night every minute of every hour of every day that is all she could think about she feels that she has let her daughters down and that she might have been better off had she not left her former partner because the temporary terror of the occasional rage was better in her view than the permanent terror that she now lives in i was moved by her story the last thing that she said to me was that she and her daughters were alive but they were not really living that was a really powerful example of how just having a roof over one\u2019s head can be the difference between being alive and actually living it would mean her having a decent quality of life and a decent future that she could look forward to with her daughters despite my best efforts to help her the lack of housing in the city and the waiting list are real problems meaning that there is a limit on what i can do to assist her and her daughters although that case was tragic moving and upsetting for me to hear it is not unique in 2012-13 nearly 6 500 households approached birmingham city council due to homelessness which is an increase of 30% over three years some 4 000 were accepted as statutorily homeless which is an increase of 17% over three years ", "my hon friend is absolutely right that the problem is national i am an mp for the country\u2019s second city despite what my mancunian colleagues might think which has the largest local authority in europe so the pressures in birmingham are stark but homelessness presents itself across the country in different ways ", "my hon friend is absolutely right i will come on to some of the issues she raises later in my speech and i will use the example of sifafireside a charity in my constituency to illustrate the pressures that homelessness services are under where are people supposed to go when services are being cut i hope that the minister may be able to provide some guidance on what i can say to my constituents when they ask me because i simply do not have any answers for them in 2012-13 922 households in birmingham were in temporary accommodation which is up 32% on the previous year and 115 of them were in bed-and-breakfast accommodation just like my constituent households have often found themselves in bed-and-breakfast accommodation that is not fit for purpose when i was first elected in 2010 the majority of homelessness-related cases that came to me involved people who could be described as vulnerable such as women escaping domestic violence people with mental health problems and people with drug or drink issues i had several cases of people who had left the care system without adequate support and had found themselves homeless there were also people who had come out of prison and who may have been in and out of prison over many years a chunk of my casework involved people with unregularised status in this country such as the people living in a twilight world while waiting for a decision on their asylum case from the uk border agency as was or the home office such people had no recourse to public funds and were homeless as a result now however although those groups remain well represented in my homelessness case load i am seeing an increase in the number of people families in particular who have been made homeless as a result of their private sector tenancy coming to an end and their being unable to find or afford anywhere else to live some months ago for example i met a couple who had a business a few years ago but it had run into trouble as a result of the recession they had lost it and could not keep up the payments on their home so they lost their home as well they managed to get other jobs earning much less than before but a job is a job they are working hard and were renting in the private rented sector but the rent went up and they could not afford the increase so they found themselves homeless they were struggling to find anywhere else to live that they could afford on their budget i am seeing many more cases of that nature the end of a private sector tenancy now accounts for 22% of all homelessness acceptances nationally a rate that i fear is likely to increase further and in my constituency the biggest rate of increase that i am seeing in my own case load the two main connected reasons are that the cost of renting is going up since 2010 it has increased by more than twice as much as wages and house building is at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s the failure to deal with housing supply is not only causing a huge strain now but storing deep problems for us as a society for the future to go back to the case of my constituent let us think about the effect on her two daughters even when i met them in my surgery they were quite down and displaying a nervous disposition their mum told me how their performance at school had dipped and they were upset as i mentioned earlier i was struck by how their only ask was somewhere clean to live the pressure on familiesand young people children in particular from always being desperate to move and never being able to put down roots causes those young people lasting harm which will present itself in different ways in the future whether in educational outcomes or in their level of confidence those are deep problems homelessness is an isolating and deskilling experience for the people affected it affects their health and well-being in a significant and often lasting and damaging way it affects the educational outcomes of the children who find themselves homeless alongside their families in addition as my hon friend the member for nottingham south (lilian greenwood) said the organisations that are there to help when people find themselves homeless are also under acute pressure if we look at birmingham city council first and foremost it is facing some of the largest cuts in local government history over the next few months the council will have to make difficult choices that will permanently change the social fabric of the wonderful city of birmingham there are a number of pressures but housing supply is key and the waiting list for people who want to transfer to other council housing is large ", "my hon friend makes a powerful point and i absolutely agree the lack of housing supply is the key problem including in birmingham we are simply not building enough homes of all descriptions and social and affordable housing has certainly not kept pace with demand that major issue has been compounded by the introduction and imposition of the bedroom tax in birmingham a little more than 5 000 city council tenants are affected as of yesterday a little more than 2 000 or so of them were in arrears as a result of the bedroom tax while the city had only five bedsits and 54 one-bedroom flats available for some of them to move into that is not only from the city register but includes the properties available from the registered providers as well those numbers speak for themselves the question that i have which i cannot answer perhaps the minister can is about where those people affected are supposed to downsize to once the five bedsits the 54 one-bed flats and the tiny number of other suitable properties have gone how will birmingham as a city cope if the 2 000 or so in rent arrears as a result of the bedroom tax find themselves homeless the city simply does not have the resources to meet that level of need or the surge in demand that will come as a result of those people being homeless ", "the hon lady\u2019s starting point would be logical were there somewhere for those people to move into the reason why i cited the birmingham figures of five bedsits and 54 one-bed flats is that as of yesterday that is what is available in my city the second largest city in this country and the largest local authority in europe for waiting lists that number in the many tens of thousands the problem is stark were there many hundreds or thousands of properties for people to downsize into allowing homeless larger families to move into the larger properties her position would be logical i am afraid however that that is simply not the case in the area that i represent or in many instances up and down the country ", "the ability of people to swap depends on appropriate accommodation for the people who want to downsize or upsize to go into and my point is that housing supply throughout my city is simply not enough for all kinds of homes i spoke about the lack of affordable and social housing but there is also a lack of housing for people to buy privately not enough is being built anywhere in the city the numbers simply have not kept up with demand swapping and other such solutions therefore will not deal with the large numbers presenting themselves in birmingham i am afraid that unless we could build thousands of homes overnight my city will not be able to cope with the issues that it is facing some but not all of which result in homelessness ", "my hon friend the shadow minister is absolutely right to cite the government\u2019s own impact assessment if people who are moving are forced into the private rented sector and their rents go up that puts extra pressure on the housing benefit budget as well i have not focused on welfare and benefits in my speech but that is an additional pressure and an additional cost for the state as it meets the increased demand and as rent in the private rented sector goes up organisations under pressure include not only birmingham city council but many that provide support to the homeless i have mentioned sifa fireside acharity based in my constituency that works with the homeless its representatives visited me and my hon friend the shadow minister in parliament a couple of weeks ago they brought a group of homeless people from across birmingham and the west midlands so that they could speak to parliamentarians about the problems they face it provides practical support to homeless people including daily drop-in sessions a resettlement service a specialist alcohol support service and an employment and training programme in 2012-13 sifa fireside provided just over 35 000 meals 500 food parcels and 3 700 showers we are talking about real basics food somewhere to have a wash and somebody to help people make some phone calls to try to get their lives back on track the charity made just over 4 000 phone calls on behalf of people who are homeless to help them sort out somewhere else to move on to and ultimately they hope somewhere permanent to live but rising prices are causing a cost of living crisis for families up and down the country and neither businesses nor charities are exempt from that problem rising costs have forced sifa fireside to cut by half the number of meals it will provide in the coming year because it can now afford to put on only one meal a day for homeless people sifa fireside provides a vital lifeline for birmingham\u2019s homeless people especially over the winter months but is facing real challenges just to stay open although i am sure that all members are grateful for the safety net that charities such as sifa fireside are providing in constituencies across the country we cannot take that for granted charities are under significant pressure and the availability of their services will be significantly curtailed certainly that is what i am seeing in my constituency several systemic problems cause homelessness the primary one is the issue we face with house building and the fact that housing supply has simply not kept up with demand also the private rented sector is not fit for families as it does not give people the security they need or predictable rent rises that would allow people to plan their household budgets finally the bedroom tax is causing acute concern we need to look at those issues in order to deal with the problem of homelessness doing so will not fix the problem entirely as people find themselves homeless for many reasons but i believe that for the 80 000 or so children whom we expect to be homeless that is according to the official figures and i think the real figure is probably higher dealing with the problems with both house building and the private rented sector and scrapping the bedroom tax would be pretty good places to start ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what estimate he has made of the average annual tax relief to individuals benefiting from employee shareholder status ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer how many people are employed by hm revenue and customs to locate and capture the 30 most wanted tax fugitives ", "first may i join the minister in paying tribute to all the members of our bill committee who helped to scrutinise the bill and provided valuable insight into its measures if there was the occasional predictable question it was always asked with good humour and good grace we have supported the employment allowance from the moment it was announced in the chancellor\u2019s last budget our bone of contention with the government has not been about the detail of the ea or who it applies to rather it has been about the time scales for its introduction we believe that the government should have changed course much earlier particularly given what happened with the previous regional national insurance holiday scheme although that helped a lot of businesses the number certainly fell far short of the 400 000 it was supposed to assist the government say this bill is about helping our country compete in the global race but if we are going to compete in the global race we will have to start getting out of the starting-blocks more quickly i therefore say to the minister that the government should have acted more swiftly on national insurance if the government had changed course sooner we may have been well into the take-up of the ea by now instead of having to wait for it finally to be introduced in april next year and the country might already be enjoying all the good effects that all of us across the house hope will flow from it in last week\u2019s autumn statement the government introduced a new measure that we have also supported today the abolition of employers\u2019 nics for all employees under 21 years of age i repeat what i said to the minister in our earlier debate however we would have liked bolder action from the government in their autumn statement to help deal with the problems of youth unemployment we do not think this measure which will come into force only in 2015 goes far enough nor will it stimulate higher levels of youth employment as quickly as we would like the real bone of contention which i fear we will continue to debate until this measure finally comes into force in 2015 is the delay none of the reasons the minister gave in his winding-up of the debate on new clause 3 for waiting until 2015 sounded sensible to me he said that if the government could have done so they would of course have wanted to bring the measure forward in 2014 but the government could also have got rid of the regional national insurance employers\u2019 holiday scheme earlier when it was clearly failing but they did not do so i do not understand why it is impossible to introduce this measure earlier i am sure we will examine that issue further when the bill is debated in the other place and through oral and written parliamentary questions the minister and i will continue to debate the merits of the introduction of that measure in 2015 as opposed to the introduction of the new clause which is what we would have liked we have supported the ea in the bill and we consider that the extension of the gaar to apply to national insurance contributions is sensible although we continue to have very real concerns about the extent of the gaar ", "as the hon gentleman knows we had exactly the same line of questioning in the bill committee and i remind him that the labour government brought in the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes which has raised a hell of a lot more money than the government believe the gaar will we have a proud and strong record on tax avoidance also that does not get the government off the hook in respect of their gaar which will not make quite the impact on the tax gap that everybody would like the measures relating to oil and gas workers and to limited liability partnerships have changed in order to clarify the government\u2019s intentions in the new clauses and the removal of old clauses 12 and 13 but they are both sensible measures that we are happy to support so although we have real concerns about the pace at which the government are moving to deal with the challenges that this country faces especially youth unemployment which we are debating today as a result of the measure in the autumn statement we support the measures themselves and will support the bill\u2019s third reading ", "i am grateful to the minister for his comments on my new clauses 1 and 2 particularly for the additional information he made available on the issues raised by new clause 2 given his explanation i am happy to withdraw the motion clause by leave withdrawn ", "given that i am still relatively new to my shadow treasury brief i am not yet as hon members who served in committee will no doubt be pleased to note suffering from review fatigue both of the new clauses seek further reviews from the government new clause 1 envisages a post-implementation review which was the subject of some debate in committee and i felt it was worth having a further discussion to push the government a little more in relation to the impact that the employment allowance will have on jobs and wage rates and the effectiveness of the promotion of the employment allowance to all those who are eligible for it new clause 2 envisages an administrative and compliance cost review a one-off review to take place six months after the employment allowance comes into force it was prompted by the evidence of mr holloway which i mentioned earlier and i shall go into more detail shortly in committee the minister helpfully indicated that he would publish information on two of the elements that i have included in new clause 1 the overall take-up of the employment allowance and its geographical spread i understand from his comments in committee that the information on the geographical location of those taking up the employment allowance will probably be available on a regional basis i hope that he will clarify that point when he responds to the debate the minister said that he would put information on both elements in the library so that members can raise questions about the effectiveness of the employment allowance and its take-up levels we have in mind the previous regional national insurance employers\u2019 holiday which had difficulties from the start we have made the point that those difficulties should have been dealt with sooner and it is in that context that we think the government should have a formal post-implementation review of the take-up of the employment allowance ", "i will repeat exactly what i said to the hon gentleman when we had this debate in committee we have been unequivocal in our support for employment allowance since it was introduced in the budget earlier this year we have taken every opportunity to say to the minister and his colleagues in the treasury team that it should be introduced sooner we could not have been more unequivocal in our support the purpose of the review is not to put the employment allowance at risk the regional national insurance employers\u2019 holiday scheme had problems with take-up from the start they were raised with ministers in this house at every available opportunity in oral and written questions yet we had to wait for the full three years of the scheme to run before the government brought forward a proposal without the same problems that is the context for tabling new clause 1 we want employment allowance to succeed and not suffer from low take-up we want it to be taken up the government say that it will be taken up by 90% of eligible employers i am sure that all members want to see 100% take-up and there seems to be no real reason why 10% should be missed off we want to ensure that take-up is not affected by any unforeseen issues during roll-out ", "it would be helpful for the review to be in the bill as it would concentrate the government\u2019s mind in ensuring that it works we had to wait the full three years for the previous scheme to finish before we had a change of course towards something that will not suffer the same problems both points are good reasons to include a review in the bill in committee the minister remarked on take-up and geographical location i am sure all members want the scheme to be taken up nationally and for it not to be skewed by region because promotion is not good enough in some parts of the country and employers do not find out about it we had a good debate on whether the review should consider the impact on the overall number of jobs and wage levels i included both in the new clause because they are worth considering the minister and other members of the committee said that they hoped the \u00a32 000 made available to employers through employment allowance will be passed on to employees either by increasing wages or taking on more employees there was also the hope that employers would be encouraged to reinvest that money in the business in research or innovative practices to help productivity it is worth trying to measure the impact of employment allowance on job levels and wage levels i take on board the point made in committee by theminister and by members of the committee on both sides of the house that the decision to either increase wages or take on new workers is for any business owner based on a number of factors and that employment allowance may be one of them the policy is not being introduced in a vacuum there is a clear intent and desire for it to stimulate employment and hopefully an increase in wages it seems sensible at least to consider the relationship between the employment allowance and job and wage levels the new clause does not envisage a methodology but i remind the minister and hon members that when the bill was introduced the federation of small businesses carried out a survey asking its members what they expected to do with the \u00a32 000 allowance and many said that they would increase job or wage levels or reinvest in their business employer surveys and other stakeholder engagement methods would be useful means of interrogating the impact of the employment allowance on job and wage levels it is worth putting that in the bill ", "in evidence to the committee the fsb said it would survey its members again anyway the government could look at that survey and work with the fsb to see how it surveys its members they might want to take a representative cohort of people who have taken up the employment allowance discuss with them its impact on their businesses and then extrapolate lessons for national take-up i do not seek to prescribe exactly how they should carry out the review i am sure there are clever bods in the treasury whose job it is to think of these things but given what has happened already in this parliament on national insurance it is important that we concentrate the mind of the government the house expects and wants this policy to succeed and not to suffer the problems of the previous policy it also wishes to continue pressing the government on this point the last element of new clause 1 concerns the effective promotion of the employment allowance to all who are eligible in particular i have in mind the fsb\u2019s evidence to the committee about the effectiveness of that communication it is worth considering that in a review particularly if there is a problem such as a geographical inequality with overall levels of take-up how the allowance is promoted will clearly have an effect charities and sports clubs are rightly eligible for this \u00a32 000 reduction in their national insurance bill but there is a risk that they might miss out and that we promote the allowance to businesses more effectively just because they have more stakeholders and larger bodies getting the message out the new clause seeks to ensure that we keep across that concern and that not only eligible businesses but other groups that rightly fall within its scope take up the employment allowance new clause 2 seeks a short administrative and compliance costs review six months after the bill comes into force it is motivated by two things in particular first as i mentioned earlier the government expect 90% of thoseeligible to claim the employment allowance the institute for fiscal studies and others we heard this in the committee evidence session have asked about the other 10% the system for claiming the employment allowance is straightforward and everybody expects the running of it to be smooth however one wonders why 10 per cent are always assumed to miss out the other driver behind the new clause was the evidence from mr holloway which was received after the committee concluded its deliberations i thought it illuminating nonetheless partly because it gave me an opportunity to get to grips with the details of payroll software an expertise that i have not previously had the pleasure of enjoying in this house mr holloway\u2019s evidence which was made available to the committee and to the minister suggested that there were problems about the guidance not being available in sufficient time for developers to get their software ready he indicated that normally three to six months is required for systems to be developed including time for specification and documentation of the changes development testing and release to clients on new clause 3 the minister said that the guidance was going to be available in january which seems to put at risk the availability of the software being ready or at least software developers will be up against it in getting everything tested and working on time before the employment allowance comes into force the purpose of the new clause is that six months in we will have an opportunity to make sure that software-type issues have been ironed out and that businesses are not reporting compliance or other administrative costs that we will not know about until it is rolled out if they are that gives an opportunity for mps and the government very early in the life of the allowance to consider what changes might be made to remove those issues both clauses are designed to assist the government from a perspective of support for the employment allowance a desire to see it work effectively a desire to make sure that every business that is eligible for it is able to take it up and a desire to see that it has a positive impact on job levels and wage rates ", "i am grateful to the minister for that helpful explanation of new clauses 4 and 5 and particularly the technical points and why the government are no longer proceeding with clauses 12 and 13 i had some concerns in committee about the impact of clause 13 in disapplying section 4(4) of the social security contributions and benefits act 1992 that seemed to be possibly going too far and was ripe for lawyers to have fun with i was one in my former life i note that the government have got rid of that problem and clarified their intention for llps by tabling new clause 5 new clauses 4 and 5 both state that the government can bring forward regulations to deal with their more technical aspects will there be an opportunity for consultation on those draft statutory instruments when they are ready so we can ensure that no further issues arise as the government try to implement the objectives that new clauses 4 and 5 are trying to achieve ", "i beg to move that the clause be read a second time ", "it does not represent a flip-flop as the hon gentleman well knows it would not be a debate on this issue if he did not make the point that he has made on a number of occasions i would have felt as though i had missed out on something if he had not made that intervention so i am grateful to him he will not be surprised if i repeat my previous answers to him in relation to national insurance i was very proud to stand for election on the labour party manifesto at the 2010 general election and proud that the labour government had got the recovery under way at the time of that election a recovery that was choked off by this government as soon as they came into power [interruption ] government members might not like to hear it but i am afraid that that does not stop it being true let me clarify my point about the employment allowance from the moment it was announced in the budget our immediate critique was not that it should not be introduced  we supported its introduction from the beginning but to say as we have continued to say  bring it in as soon as possible why wait if there were compelling reasonsfor the wait it would be understandable but i am afraid that i find nothing compelling in anything the minister has ever said about the delay in bringing these proposals forward all the issues relating to it and systems and getting software up and running could be sorted out with a bit of will i understand that software developers are still waiting on hmrc to give them the full guidelines on what software they will need to produce to make sure that take-up of the employment allowance goes ahead with relative ease i hope that the minister has had sight of the submission by mr holloway of the learn centre to the national insurance contributions bill committee which was submitted after the committee had disbanded but was still made available to all its members because it contains concerns about the delay in getting proper clarification and explanation to software developers on what they need to do in relation to the employment allowance given that it is december and they have to get ready for the employment allowance to come online in april 2014 they will not have a huge amount of time to get everything in place and ready if that is the position on the employment allowance then why not add in the proposal on nics for under-21s and deal with both issues at the same time given that we are speaking from the opposition benches unfortunately our amendment does not propose that the measure should be introduced immediately in 2014 otherwise government members would no doubt have shouted at us about the cost of doing so and the spending commitment entailed however we have asked for a review that would look at the level of youth unemployment now and the impact that introducing the measure in april 2014 would have had on the level of youth unemployment as it stands today that is because the government should not escape scrutiny for the impact that this measure may have had compared with what it will have i hope when it comes into force in 2015 if it is found that the measure would have had a significant impact as we believe it would that is an important bit of information and the government would be put under pressure to introduce it sooner than they intended this government found money in the autumn statement for the married couples allowance they have always said that the recognition of marriage in the tax system is symbolic however government is about choices and priorities and if money can be found immediately to do something that is symbolic and sends a message then surely it should be found for a practical government measure that helps to prioritise our young people who need jobs today and not on a date far from now the choices and priorities of this government are wrong and they should think again the emergency presented to this country by the current rate of youth unemployment cannot wait to be dealt with on some future date the government should reconsider the start date of this proposal we therefore intend to press our amendment to a vote ", "i wish to speak to amendment (a) to new clause 3 i welcome the minister\u2019s explanation of the thinking behind the new clause and his clarification of how the age limit will be interpreted his clarification of the measure\u2019s impact on pensions was also helpful given that we did not have these proposals before us when the committee considered the bill in general the government\u2019s new proposal announced in the autumn statement last week will hopefully encourage employers to take on more young people under the age of 21 with youth unemployment so high it is nearly 1 million and long-term youth unemployment a real concern some action is welcome but as the minister has anticipated and as our amendment suggests we have some concerns about how the government are going about dealing with the issue i will deal first with some practical points relating to new clause 3 before moving on to our more substantive concerns about the government\u2019s approach i have briefly discussed the impact of the measures with various stakeholders who have been scrutinising the new clause since the government tabled it given that we were unable to scrutinise it in committee because of when it was tabled it would be helpful if the minister could at least give the house the benefit of his thoughts on theissues i am about to raise members of the other place can then take forward some of our concerns if there is more in them what impact does the minister think the new measure will have on young people who are employed part time as he will know we have seen a huge rise in part-time employment and insecure employment for example through the growth of zero-hours contracts something the house has debated a great deal in this parliament my understanding is that many young people who work part time will not be caught by the measure because they earn far beneath the primary threshold what consideration has he given to the impact on young people who are employed part time given that for so many of them their first job is part time as many members will know it is now not unusual for young people on the work programme to be offered only part-time employment of zero-hours contracts so it would be helpful if he could explain the government\u2019s thinking on that i would also welcome the minister\u2019s view on how the measure might interact with the willingness of employers to take on graduates and the impact it might have on graduate employment that is not about passing a value judgment on whether someone is taken on when they are 18 or whether employers decide to employ a graduate but the minister knows that the other announcements made in the autumn statement in relation to young people were about an increase in student numbers of 30 000 and a removal of student number controls to enable universities to take on as many students as they like the number of 18-year-olds in particular participating in higher education is likely to increase it would therefore be helpful if the minister could outline the government\u2019s thinking on how those two changes will interact and how they will ensure that they work in a complementary way rather than skewing one type of recruitment practice ahead of another those issues are worthy of much greater deliberation than we will have the opportunity for today so we might need to return to them depending on what happens as the bill makes progress i have two other points to make on the practicalities of new clause 3 first we need to ensure that it is promoted properly to employers particularly micro-businesses and even one-man bands which might be encouraged to take on a young person perhaps a family member how will we ensure that they know exactly how that will operate and how it will interact with the employment allowance that is important to ensure that micro-businesses in particular are well aware of how the two things align and that there is no confusion that could lead to a decrease in take-up secondly my understanding is that no new funding has been announced to pay for the proposal so it would be helpful if the minister could set out where the money will come from and how the costs are expected to increase and not only in the first or second years but in future years there are two main points of difference between the opposition and the government in relation to the new proposal first it is not bold enough the minister will know because we have discussed it before about the scale of the challenge we face and what the government could and should have done to tackle the scourge of youth unemployment ", "i am grateful to my hon friend for her intervention and agree with her entirely i was going to move on to that point we disagree with the government\u2019s approach because we do not think that the proposal is bold enough but we are also concerned about the timing i will return to this later because it has a direct impact on our proposed amendment to the new clause youth unemployment is nearly 1 million around 940 000 young people are unemployed and the most recent figures published in november show that long-term youth unemployment has increased given the scale of the problem and the impact that every single day of unemployment has on a young person\u2019s overall life chances i believe that the government should have come back with a much bolder offer in the autumn statement it was a missed opportunity to go further and faster the minister will not be surprised to hear that i think the government should have adopted our alternative proposal for a compulsory jobs guarantee for every young person under the age of 25 who is out of work funded by a tax on bank bonuses [interruption ] it has been spent only once government members should look at the detail the young person would have to take up the job or risk losing their benefits ", "my hon friend is absolutely right the government\u2019s youth contract has been branded a failure by their own advisers it is also worth noting that the work programme is finding work for only one in six long-term unemployed people the house heard earlier when the secretary of state for work and pensions was called to answer an urgent question about the other difficulties with the work programme the scale of the problem we face in relation to youth unemployment is stark i speak as the member who represents the constituency with the highest rate of unemployment in the country i meet many young people every day in my constituency who are themselves the children of people who found themselves unemployed in the last great recession in the 1980s they are having the same problems that their parents\u2019 generation had every day that a young person tries hard but fails to get a job increases their desperation and depression i recently held a youth jobs fair in my constituency along with my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill (mr byrne) and my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington (jack dromey) more than 2 000 young people attended and every one of them spoke of their desperation and their desire to find work and the difficulties of finding work in the current climate in those circumstances knowing how much of a knock a young person\u2019s life chances take when they find themselves unemployed for a long period i think that it is right for the government to consider taking muchbolder action the fact that they have failed to do so shows that they have failed to meet the scale of the challenge of our times i fear that we are storing up a much bigger problem for the future in the absence of such action my point to the minister is that we hope the new clause will stimulate more employment for young people and encourage employers to consider taking on a young person and that it therefore helps to get to grips with some of the problems it is a good proposal it does not go as far as we would like and perhaps it will not have the impact that a compulsory jobs guarantee would have but on its own terms it is a good proposal so why not do it now nothing the minister mentioned seemed to be an insurmountable problem he said that the it situation would be a little difficult but we should not let it difficulties at hmrc stop us getting to grips with the scourge of youth unemployment he has failed to introduce the employment allowance as soon as we believe it should have been introduced he also decided not to scrap the regional national insurance employers holiday so letting it run for three years yet he knows that it fell far short of the targets that were set for it at the beginning the minister said that the problem with the april 2014 date is that the government wanted to wait until real-time information was all online and working properly however i have interrogated others on this point and it was apparently not impossible or too difficult for the government to amend the it situation so as to enable the employment allowance to be brought in earlier than april next year i am afraid that the same point applies to the proposal on national insurance for under-21s the minister has said nothing that suggests that it should not be brought in as early as possible april 2014 being the best date on offer ", "after those answers we still do not know why the chancellor is resisting our proposal to allow the obr to audit all party spending and tax plans ahead of the general election we know that in private the chief secretary agrees that it is a good idea so what is the chancellor so afraid of ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what hm revenue and customs' compliance yield has been in the financial year to date ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer whether the introduction of a four-digit pin for those completing the hm revenue and customs staff survey will enable individual responses to be identified ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer when the results of the 2013 hm revenue and customs annual staff survey will be published ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer pursuant to the answer of 10 september 2013 official report column 348w on revenue and customs what progress his department has made on its future plans for full-time equivalent numbers at hm revenue and customs in each area of its activity on 31 march in each year between 2014 and 2016 ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer how many staff members of each directorate of hm revenue and customs are within three years of retirement age ", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what recent progress has been made by hm revenue and customs in initiating proceedings against those included in the 2012 and 2013 most wanted lists of tax fugitives and if he will make a statement ", "we have had an excellent debate and many fine speeches have been made in support of our motion calling on the government to take action to ease the burden of business rates on all sectors the chair of the communities and local government committee my hon friend the member for sheffield south east (mr betts) welcomed the review of appeals announced by the minister during his speech that measure has been welcomed by hon members from both sides of the house we of course await further details on the shape of that review my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland (tom blenkinsop) reminded the house about small business saturday that brilliant initiative which is taking place on saturday was first championed by my hon friend the member for streatham (mr umunna) my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland also reminded us that businesses need help throughout the year and that would certainly be delivered by the cut and freeze in business rates that we are calling for today my hon friend the member for wirral south (alison mcgovern) spoke with passion about businesses in her constituency and i congratulate them on their early small business saturday she told the house that small businesses are fighting for their lives they need action now which a cut and freeze in business rates would certainly deliver my hon friend the member for bolton south east (yasmin qureshi) reminded all hon members that the leader of the opposition has set the pace in this debate just as he has on energy prices leaving the government to flounder and to make u-turn after u-turn my hon friend the member for sefton central (bill esterson) spoke about the importance of retailers who as he rightly said are at the heart of our communities they in particular are struggling with business rates and they would certainly welcome our proposals to cut and freeze those rates my hon friend the member for rochdale (simon danczuk) has been campaigning on business rates for as long as he has been in the house i congratulate him on his campaign to raise awareness about their impact i look forward to visiting danczuk\u2019s deli very soon if he can sort out his own business rates issue my hon friend the member for swansea west (geraint davies) spoke eloquently on how government is about choice the government are making the wrong choices for small businesses up and down our country my hon friend the member for stretford and urmston (kate green) welcomed the review of the appeals process she detailed the many concerns relating to the valuation office agency that are shared by hon members on both sides of the house it is clear that businesses are facing a cost-of-doing-business crisis alongside the cost-of-living crisis that is hitting families across britain unless the government change course tomorrow businesses will be hit by an average rise in business rates of \u00a3430 next april at a total cost to business of \u00a3700 million because of the impact of inflation business rates have already gone up by an average of \u00a31 500 under this government the reality is that many businesses in fact more than one in 10 small ones are now paying more in business rates than in rent up and down the country including in my constituency businesses are being put in an impossible situation either they pass on the increase in rates to their customers or they continue to face a squeeze until they can no longer afford to stay in business the pressures small businesses face are stark unless things change business rates will have risen by an average of nearly \u00a32 000 by the end of this parliament there are 40 000 empty shops in the uk one in seven shops are empty which is blighting the uk\u2019s high streets and town centres the british retail consortium has estimated that the business rate increase from april next year will mean an increase of \u00a3242 million per annum for retailers it has also said that the increase is likely to put 19 670 full-time jobs at risk owing to potential shop closures and reduced investment our economy can afford neither change why does this issue matter small businesses are the engine of our economy of the 4 9 million businesses in the uk 99% are small or medium-sized enterprises between them they employ nearly half the uk work force nearly 90% of the people who go from being unemployed to having a private sector job work for a small business small businesses are therefore making a huge contribution to tackling unemployment in this country small businesses are the driving force behind jobs and growth they account for more than half the economy most of the new jobs in the next 15 years will be created by businesses that do not yet exist growth and small businesses go hand in hand we cannot deliver excellent public services without the contribution that they make to the economy the cost-of-doing-business crisis that has been delivered by the government cannot go on our small businesses deserve better that is why at our annual conference in september we announced that the next labour government would cut business rates in 2015 and freeze them in 2016 that pledge would give businesses a much-needed boost and would mean an average saving of nearly \u00a3450 for more than 1 5 million business premises some government members have said that that amounts to small beer that is doing down the needs of businesses particularly given that action on business rates is the single biggest thing that has been requested by businesses i wonder whether the small beer phraseology will be used tomorrow if the chancellor announces a cap of2% as is expected no doubt they will trumpet that saving of a couple of hundred pounds even though our cut would deliver a saving of \u00a3450 on average politics is about choices and priorities it is right that the uk should have a competitive corporation tax rate but it is also right to take decisions that help small businesses we will cut business rates on properties with an annual rental value of below \u00a350 000 in 2015 and freeze business rates for those properties in 2016 we will pay for that by reversing the additional cut in the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% in 2015 the main rate of corporation tax is paid by companies with profits of more than \u00a31 5 million essentially the larger multinational companies companies that have profits of less than \u00a3300 000 and that pay the lower rate of corporation tax will not be affected by contrast the government have thus far failed to rise to the scale of the challenge they have provided temporary relief for the very smallest properties up to a value of \u00a36 000 and partial rate relief for properties up to a value of \u00a312 000 those measures do not go far enough as with energy prices since our announcement in september the government have come under increasing pressure to listen and take action we heard this morning that they have finally given in and that the chancellor will announce tomorrow that business rate rises will be limited to 2% in england and wales next year rather than rising by 3 2% in line with the retail prices index that still falls far short of what firms that are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis have been crying out for just as energy bills will still go up under the government\u2019s plans business rates will still go up under this proposal firms will still see business rates rise by an average of more than \u00a3250 in april next year and that comes on top of the \u00a31 500 by which they have already gone up under this government by contrast under our plan 1 5 million start-ups workshops and shops would benefit from a cut and then a freeze in business rates if the government are going to change course they should do so in a comprehensive and decisive way that would see rate bills cut they should adopt labour\u2019s proposal nothing less than that comprehensive action will do because our small businesses deserve better than what the government have delivered i commend the motion to the house ", "the government have today been pushed into action on business rates by labour but just as energy bills will still rise this winter businesses rates too will still go up by an average of \u00a3250 next year does the deputy prime minister agree that nothing less than labour\u2019s plan to cut and then freeze business rates will do ", " i am grateful to the minister for his comments and echo almost all his remarks i have to say that it is somewhat disconcerting to start my career in the shadow treasury team agreeing with quite so much of what he has to say i look forward to being thoroughly disabused of that position soon in my first outing against the minister we considered a piece of delegated legislation that involved a huge amount from my previous role as shadow spokesperson on universities and science he said  it\u2019s not always like this but he is having to say that to me again i look forward to taking a different approach when we consider the finance bill i thank you mr streeter for your chairmanship of the committee and your help in guiding me through the procedure i also want to put on record my thanks to sir alan for his chairmanship of the evidence sessions i echo the minister\u2019s thanks to hansard the clerks police officials the whips on both sides of the committee and all members who contributed to scrutinising the bill see it as an early christmas present from me to everyone that we have finished so early i hope that the minister will reciprocate i remind him that i am a muslim and our equivalent to christmas is eid which is celebrated twice a year so i hope he will be doubly generous at some appropriate moment and keep things to good time ", " the minister\u2019s introduction to the clause was helpful and answered some of the issues that arose from the final question i asked him when he gave evidence to the committee the impact of a complete disapplication of section 4(4) of the llp act was not originally clear however i note that the minister returned to something originally raised in the consultation on conditionality for working out the actual status of a member of an llp he says that that will come through regulations and we know that we must also wait for further legislation on partnerships so could he set out to the committee the sequence of those regulations and the legislation to come how will that take the issue relating to llps further so that we reach a place of complete clarity about how members are to be treated and which definitions apply now that section 4(4) is disapplied are we looking at using the definitions from the 1992 act permanently or only until new regulations are introduced ", " the minister and i will no doubt disagree on many occasions about the gaar today is one such occasion although its application to the bill \u00a0such as it is is uncontroversial the problem that we have with the general anti-abuse rule as it stands is that it is so narrowly defined that the number of occasions on which it will be used will be few and far between a question therefore arises of the extent to which it will prevent the kind of abuse that has caused the public such outrage in recent months the rule requires the agreement of a panel of experts all of whom are drawn from the tax avoidance industry before it can be used by hmrc and that consent is not unlikely in most cases ", " no and i am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the position but i believe that that impression is given to the public the minister knows that i am referring to the incident of a former member of the independent advisory panel on the gaar who had to resign after he was caught at a tax planning conference advising people how to keep money out of the chancellor\u2019s grubby mitts that does not create a huge amount of confidence among the public about how the independent advisory panel and the gaar might operate i accept that the gentleman in question has resigned but i hope that the minister recognises that the policy must not only be effectively implemented but send the right signals and as signals go that was a pretty bad one ", " the hon gentleman says that i had a career in the accounting industry but i did not i was a barrister specialising in professional indemnity litigation i hope he did not get his information from my wikipedia entry which also has me down as two years younger than i am ", " i think that is quite enough discussion about wikipedia but i am grateful to the hon gentleman for giving me the opportunity to set the record straight i am sure the minister did not mean to forget about the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes in his response to the hon member for skipton and ripon i am sure his amnesia was only temporary and that he will remember that in 2004 the labour government introduced that process to require disclosure as a result of the information obtained from that 90-odd changes to tax law were made the government are building on that process which has led to a recovery of revenue in the range of \u00a316 billion and has had a profound impact on tax avoidance in this country it has certainly recovered a great deal more than the government\u2019s estimate of how much the gaar will yield which is only \u00a385 million a year by 2017-18 in the context of the \u00a316 billion raised by the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes that is a very small amount the thrust of the gaar ought to be to close the tax gap but given that that is in the \u00a335 billion range the gaar\u2019s contribution to that will be very small one of our problems with the gaar is that its scale is so small that it will not do enough to close the tax gap as the minister knows there are no penalties for using a scheme to which the rule might be applied so there is little or no disincentive for anyone who seeks to avoid tax the gaar is in danger of becoming a mere fig leaf to which the government can point to say they are doing something about tax abuse and avoidance however in reality it will not change the picture profoundly it will certainly not go as far as the disclosure process that we introduced in 2004 which made a much greater contribution to closing the tax gap as the minister considers the gaar which i am sure like everything else he keeps under constant review i hope he will take on board the points that have been made about its effectiveness a government scheme for closing down tax avoidance should do more to close the tax gap than he estimates his policy will ", " i thank the minister again for his introduction to the clause i absolutely accept his point that from an administrative perspective this is a simple system to enable employers to claim the allowance i have couple of points around the software the software obviously needs to support the simplicity of the process the minister will be aware that real time information has had a few issues in relation to the accessing of employers\u2019 records in particular there have been some stories in the press recently about difficulties with rti so will he update the committee on how that is going and whether it poses any particular issues for the employment allowance we have had a lot of discussion in this committee around effective communication of the allowance and i am pleased that there is a procedure in the legislation to allow it to be claimed when somebody did not realise that they were entitled to it i hope that that information will be easily and readily available on the relevant government website and that signposting to employers who may have forgotten or did not realise that they could claim will be as clear as it can be ", " the minister answered my main question in his opening remarks regarding the wording used in clause 3 and schedule 1 on connected persons when he confirmed that the way in which the bill seeks to decide whether two or more companies fall within the connected persons test is the usual way that businesses and charities are treated in tax legislation does anything in clause 3 or schedule 1 represent an innovation in how businesses and charities are treated for the purposes of deciding whether they are connected persons in the context of tax legislation ", " i am grateful to the minister for his introduction to clause 2 i shall take each of the exceptions in turn very quickly we had a very helpful evidence session on public authorities and a line of questioning was followed by my hon friend the member for scunthorpe in his exchanges with mr manclark who is in the public gallery today for the sake of clarity i would like the minister to respond when he winds up the debate on the clause to my questions the situation is that set of employees work for a local authority their function is contracted out to company a which is then taken over by company b the normal tupe regulations apply to the treatment of the employees as long as company a does 50% or more work that is private in nature it will be able to claim the employment allowance when the employees carrying out that public function move from the local authority to company a will the minister confirm that that understanding is correct mr manclark has said that the 50% test for deciding whether somebody is wholly or mainly carrying out either a public or a private function is helpful he clarified to my hon friend the very point the minister has just made by giving the committee examples of functions that would be considered to be public and those that would be considered to be private we might consider the running of a prison or a cleaning contract for a set of government or public buildings that may or may not include a prison of course it is often the case that one or two very large companies have contracts that encompass parts that would be considered public in function and others that would be considered private i am interested in what the minister has to say about the boundary close to and just over 50% presumably her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs has some experience of policing that boundary and of applying tests to determine whether a company carries out a function in whole in part or in the main will the minister give us further details on how those boundaries are policed and the way in which that test is applied perhaps with some real examples of previous hmrc experience that would be very helpful to the committee even when government buildings are cleaned by private companies public money is used to pay them for the benefit of the committee it would be helpful if the minister could set out the rationale for allowing that set of transactions to be subject to the employment allowance in contrast it is easier to understand the rationale for allowing other types of businesses engaging in normal business activity to flourish create jobs and i hope increase wages and so on by using the employment allowance in that way will the minister talk the committee through what assessment hmrc has made of potential pressure points in the legislation i appreciate that he probably will not want to tell us in detail what those pressure points are \u00a0 he does not want to alert tax planners immediately having discussed something he might close it down but i leave that to his discretion and judgment the point was raised in oral evidence that the bill will be looked at from the point of view of efficient tax planning it would be helpful to know what hmrc has done to try and pre-empt that and how that process works in practice when we have new legislation of this nature the legislation will stop an employer from claiming the allowance and transferring the business to another employer the second employer will not be allowed to claim the allowance for the same employees in the same tax year that is sensible and clearly necessary in the legislation was consideration given to a slightly different scenario in which company a transfers to company b in april 2014 just as the employment allowance kicks in but company a had not claimed any part of the employment allowance my reading of the bill is that company b would still not be able to claim any allowance for that tax year and it would be helpful if the minister could clarify whether that is correct did he consider whether a partially claimed allowance from company a might be allowed to transfer to company b so that the full \u00a32 000 benefit can realised for one set of employees in a given tax year will he set out the government\u2019s thinking on that scenario ", " just to pick up on that point i fully take on board that the allowance is not large enough to make wide scale avoidance behaviour likely we discussed franchises in oral evidence and how each individual franchise could claim the allowance across a franchise it might be the norm to behave in a certain way in order for each of those individuals to get the \u00a32 000 allowance ", " i am grateful for the minister\u2019s indication that he is happy to publish a report on some of the information detailed in the new clause and to put it in the library i take his point in relation to jobs he is making his argument about that at the moment is he saying that the information mentioned in paragraphs (b) to (e) of new clause 2(2) will be encompassed by what he hopes to publish or is he simply referring to take-up and geographical location which are covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) ", " i want to take the minister back to his point about the government\u2019s previous regional nics scheme and the counter-suggestion made by the official opposition i made this point to him on second reading as well our national insurance proposals were a refinement of the government\u2019s then scheme and it was a case of trying to achieve the same objectives as \u00a0the government set out for their scheme while opening up that scheme the key point is that our suggestions were national in application as opposed to regional which was a big difference the regional application has been dropped which is why we wholeheartedly support the employment allowance i hope he will acknowledge that ", " i too will not be drawn into discussing the government\u2019s predictions on how the deficit would be eliminated by the end of this parliament and the fact that they will miss that target by at least five years we will take the issue up another time i am grateful to the minister for his indications on publishing some of the data envisaged in the new clause and hope that we can continue the discussion on jobs as the bill progresses i will perhaps look to return to that issue on report but for now i am happy to proceed ", " i know that the hon gentleman is not doing this wilfully but he misunderstands the point of the review it is not about employers clicking a button on a website it is about looking at the overall national take-up of the scheme the areas in which the scheme is being taken up and the cold spots where it is not being taken up sufficiently a review would give us an opportunity to assess that formally the minister said in oral evidence that the assessment would be done by hmrc anyway our proposal would simply ensure that the information was brought before parliament ", " we have offered unequivocal unqualified support for the measure the only amendment that we have tabled to the bill is this new clause proposing a review how much more vocal can we be in our support for the employment allowance when the hon gentleman intervened during my speech he tried to tempt me into making a manifesto commitment i am sure that all businesses that might be listening will recognise that it is sensible that we set out our proposals on all our policies in our manifesto nearer the election however i am also sure that they will have noted our recent policy announcements on business rates and energy price freezes which show a wider support for business ", " my hon friend is right it should not be beyond the wit of government to create a post-implementation review that is not over-bureaucratic but at least ensures that some of the problems with the previous scheme are not experienced when the new employment allowance is rolled out ", " i note the hon gentleman\u2019s point about trying not to overload people with more work just for the sake of a box-ticking exercise however the minister was clear in his oral evidence that an assessment process would take place in hmrc we had an interesting exchange about talking of things being constantly under review but he was clear that there would be an assessment and that parliamentarians would play a part in that assessment no doubt mps who think that businesses in their constituency are not taking up the employment allowance will be vociferous in making sure that the government hear that point and do something about it my point is that if the assessment is occurring in hmrc anyway in some shape or form it would not be improper in fact i would say it would be very proper for parliamentarians to see what it looks like the new clause would ensure that the direct problems with the regional scheme could not slip off the radar i am sure that the federation of small businesses will be very alive to the point about effective communication and will want to ensure that take-up is as high as possible however i do not think we can subcontract to the fsb the government\u2019s duty to ensure that they communicate about the policy effectively ", " i would expect all members of parliament from all parties to ensure that businesses are aware of the different allowances that are available to them all responsible members of parliament do what they can to help businesses in their constituencies and ensuring that people are aware of the employment allowance will be one way of doing that however that does not take away the government\u2019s responsibility for ensuring that they do their bit ", " my hon friend takes an excellent opportunity to remind all hon members about the brilliant proposal that is small business saturday of course i was formerly a member of the team of my hon friend the member for streatham so i was heavily involved in ensuring that we have a small business saturday in this country to follow on from the excellent experiences of that programme in the united states i know that many members from both sides of the house are doing their bit for small business saturday and i hope that all members of the committee will be doing so as well i put on record that i commend my hon friend the member for streatham for taking the lead on that issue and recognising that it is a really positive way of putting the focus on small business we should take pride in our small businesses and recognise the huge amount of work they do for the national economy let me deal with the detail of new clause 1 i will return to the provision about job numbers later as i appreciate that some of the oral evidence suggested that it might be difficult to work out the number of jobs created the new clause suggests that other points to address in a report to parliament would be the level of take-up of the employment allowance\u2026the geographical locations of the businesses taking up the employment allowance\u2026the number of charities and clubs taking up the\u2026allowance and\u2026the overall cost to the exchequer of the\u2026allowance and projected costs for future years dealing with those points would require no more than collating data the government already have a report could then be presented to parliament so that hon members could debate it ", " my hon friend is right that such a report would help to cement the employment allowance it would also help parliamentarians to ensure that we do our bit to make the employment allowance a success ", " i will come on to the specific point about jobs i accept that that aspect of the review process would not be as linear as some of the others proposed in the new clause ", " i agree with my hon friend that was why i included a provision about jobs in the new clause and i shall explain why that is important in a moment the extent of take-up is directly connected with the question of the number of charities and clubs that will avail themselves of the employment allowance the policy rightly focuses on business but i worry that it will be more difficult for charities and especially small sports clubs to find out about it they may not go on to the hmrc website each day although they are clearly missing out if they do not and it would not be their normal practice to check other government communications to find out whether anything is happening that affects them ensuring that the communication of the policy filters down to charities and sports clubs will be an important factor in determining the success of the allowance during our evidence sessions i pressed mr cherry from the federation of small businesses about what his organisation meant by effective communication it clearly thought that that took a number of different forms such as a letter from the government to businesses or information on the hmrc website however mr cherry was somewhat disparaging of the hmrc website he did not think it was easy to use and i have not found it the easiest website to find one\u2019s way around has the minister considered mr cherry\u2019s remarks about the ease of using the hmrc website are there any plans to open it up a bit more government members focused on how the government communicate policies through a digital forum to help businesses so i hope that the measure will be part of the government\u2019s constant review of their communication strategies it will be somewhat easier to get the message out to business than it will to charities and sports clubs can the minister tell us about any specific ways in which the government hope to assist charities and sports clubs to know what the allowance is and how it might help them if we were able to collect the relevant information in a formal report it would help members to ensure that they play their part if they knew of charities and \u00a0clubs in their constituencies that were not taking up the allowance the report would give them an opportunity to ensure that they could get the message out finally let me turn to how we work out whether the policy has had an impact on job creation i accept at the outset that the process is not linear as i said to the hon member for enfield north a moment ago the picture is much more complex than employers simply saying  we now have an allowance so i will create another job however the clear intention of the policy is to stimulate the economy and one way of doing that is to increase job numbers alternatively businesses that take up the allowance might increase staff wages or as i said earlier make additional investment in new machines or equipment or even small-scale research and development to improve their internal processes ", " the hon gentleman is right to raise the fsb survey which i was about to come on to i accept that it is not possible for the government to make a linear measurement on a direct link but it is possible to ascertain the intentions of businesses as the federation of small businesses has done its survey has produced statistics that will help parliamentarians to assess the economic impact of the policy it would be good to extend that survey process so that we find out in six months or a year whether businesses have undertaken the measures that they thought they would when the employment allowance was introduced that would give parliamentarians important information with which we could judge whether the policy represented money well spent and whether it was having the stimulating effect on the economy for which we had hoped in oral evidence mr cherry implied that the fsb will carry out further surveys following the introduction of the allowance i envisage the government either working with the fsb on such surveys or conducting a similar exercise there would need to be an element of extrapolation following such surveys but at least we would get enough information to judge whether the policy is having the impact we want many firms will use the employment allowance to bolster their profits there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself but we would all hope that businesses also use some of the allowance if not all of it to do things that will help the economy particularly regarding jobs and wages it is important that we are able to take stock of any such action by reviewing the policy i hope that hon members understand that a post-implementation review is intended not to be over-bureaucratic exercise but to provide helpful information \u00a0the suggestion should also be considered in the context of the previous regional scheme which faced significant difficulties although all those difficulties were identified at an early stage through written and oral questions to the minister the scheme was still allowed to run for its full three years it was not brought to an early end so that the government could establish a new course given what happened before it is entirely proper that we formally review the policy at a relatively early stage to ensure it is doing what we all want it to do i know that the minister said in oral evidence that the new scheme will be much simpler than the previous one and that many of the problems that afflicted that previous scheme have been remedied we recognise that the new scheme is much more straightforward which could be described as a good thing in and of itself however a post-implementation review would give us the opportunity to assess the scheme\u2019s impact on the economy so i hope that the minister will take that on board ", " it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr streeter in my first bill committee speaking from the front bench please forgive me if i trip up on procedure i am sure that you will correct me and that the committee will bear with me if necessary we had two useful evidence sittings they helped to illuminate some of the issues raised by the bill and gave some indication as to the thinking behind the new clause which i will speak to a little later clause 1 is the principal clause of the bill it introduces the employment allowance which was first discussed by the chancellor in the budget it is worth up to \u00a32 000 for all businesses charities and sports clubs and the opposition support it we had an interesting debate on second reading on that point ", " many of the issues that we raised in relation to a previous scheme introduced by the government which i will speak about at length in my remarks are taken up in this employment allowance we absolutely support the employment allowance we have concerns about reviewing how it is working which is the thinking behind new clause 1 but we think that the employment allowance is a good thing in fact we think that some change in the government\u2019s approach to national insurance contributions and businesses was long overdue which leads me very nicely to the government\u2019s previous scheme ", " i am pleased that the hon gentleman got in with his standard remark about the labour party manifesto commitment i knew that he would come in early with that point and he certainly did not disappoint he will not be surprised if this apple of a policy point is one that i refuse to bite we had a number of concerns about the conduct of the government and their previous regional national insurance employer\u2019s scheme that is the point of the bill we have long called for changes to that regional three-year scheme from the beginning we had concerns about aspects of it we wanted the government to change course very early on and we set out alternative ways for them to consider we are pleased that they have finally moved it is a shame that it took three years with businesses continuing to struggle in the meantime for us to get to this point the regional national insurance holiday scheme was a flagship policy of the government\u2019s first emergency budget it ran for three years from september 2010 until september 2013 and applied only to new businesses created after 22 june 2010 under that scheme new businesses would not have to pay the first \u00a35 000 in national insurance for each of their first 10 employees during the first year of business greater london the south-east and the eastern region were all excluded from the scheme the thinking was that it was explicitly designed to try to stimulate private sector growth in parts of the country where there was a suggested over-reliance on the public sector and it was designed to stimulate jobs the government believed that 400 000 businesses would benefit equating to around 800 000 employees at a total cost of about \u00a3940 million in the end the scheme helped 25 000 businesses still it is fair to say a substantial number no one would decry businesses that availed themselves of the assistance that the scheme provided however that number was very far off the 400 000 originally predicted 375 000 fewer than originally claimed of the \u00a3940 million set aside to pay for the scheme only \u00a360 million or so was ultimately paid out that equates to about 6% of the total amount originally intended one of the first issues of debate around the original regional national insurance holiday scheme was its regionality element it explicitly excluded three regions of the country the committee that considered the detail of that bill had a huge amount of debate around that regionality element the member then speaking for the opposition tabled a number of amendments trying to persuade the minister it was the same minister although the opposition front bencher has changed [interruption ] they have all moved up so i hope that bodes well for me too we tried to persuade the minister to consider different ways of expanding the scheme so that instead of being a regional scheme it would become a national scheme among the amendments considered were some focusing on constituencies that had particularly high rates of unemployment and others that would have dropped the regionality element altogether making the scheme national in every way the government stuck to their regional plan and the low take-up is an indictment of the scheme\u2019s regionality element which was never going to work it certainly did not help with one of the purposes of the scheme which was to try to remedy some of the regional imbalances that we see in our economy it is also telling that of the analysis that the government published on the new employment allowance 40% of the expected number of employers who will now not pay any national insurance contributions under the new employment allowance are based in regions that were previously excluded that shows that the balance that the government achieved with the original scheme was wholly wrong they should have listened to the criticism around regionality and dropped that condition at the earliest opportunity the second issue debated at length in the previous bill committee considering the regional scheme related to including charities again that has been included and brought within the scope of the employment allowance that is a welcome step but once again i put to the minister that it would have been better if we had not allowed that scheme to last for the full three years it was clear that it was failing almost from the off and the government should have changed course a lot sooner than they did the previous policy had the specific intention of trying to stimulate private sector job growth and encourage new businesses to take on new staff it is fair to say that it is hoped that the employment allowance will have the same impact although that is not the explicit intention the minister has not put any figures behind what kinds of impact he hopes will be achieved although he accepts that the allowance is a good thing from the perspective of businesses it is very welcome the federation of small businesses in particular is very happy and now \u00a0has a clear campaign point for every budget from now on to try to push for the \u00a32 000 limit to be increased i am sure that we will all have to respond to those campaigns at some point there is not the same kind of explicit intention behind the measurement of the policy that is an important point because it involves large expenditure by the exchequer and a tax give-away to businesses however the exchequer and all of us parliamentarians hope that it will stimulate particular effects in the economy those effects may relate to job creation and to slightly higher wages given that employers would no longer have to pay the first \u00a32 000 of their national insurance bill the policy may also stimulate some addition investment by businesses we would all agree that if we can get small and medium-sized businesses in particular to invest a little more in research and innovation which may assist them with their business practices that would be a good thing there are a number of things that we hope this employment allowance would achieve but there is no way at present unless the minister disabuses me of measuring how the policy is getting on given the experience of the regional national insurance holiday scheme and all the issues associated with it it is right and proper that we consider the thrust of new clause 1 and the idea of a post-implementation review of the employment allowance in the oral evidence session both the institute for fiscal studies and the federation of small businesses indicated support for a post-implementation review of the employment allowance i hope that the minister will have taken that on board ", " my hon friend makes an important point and i agree with it ", " the hon gentleman would not expect me to make any commitments ahead of the next general election but let me make clear the intention of the post-implementation review it is not designed to say that the scheme is failing i was going to come to the point about effective communication and effective advertisement of the scheme to businesses low take-up was a huge problem with the regional scheme and the new clause looks particularly at take-up and where it is occurring that is important because \u00a0problems with take-up ought to be highlighted to the government at the earliest opportunity so that they can remedy them and all businesses can avail themselves of the employment allowance ", " i thank the minister and his officials for giving evidence to the committee may i start by asking you what criteria you have set for assessing the impact of the employment allowance and hopefully its success ", " may i press you on that you say that you will keep the policy  under review i know that that is a standard phrase that is often used but what will that mean in practice inside hmrc presumably there will be some criteria against which you will be measuring throughout that constant review ", " have you considered carrying out a formal post-implementation review at a suitable point after the introduction of the employment allowance ", " moving on to exclusions purely domestic employers are obviously excluded from being able to access the employment allowance but it would appear that if a person engages a carer nanny or gardener through that individual\u2019s own personal service company and the company then pays that individual a wage the company would be eligible for the employment allowance is that correct ", " my question was less about the set-up for agencies and more about when an enterprising and highly knowledgeable nanny or indeed her eventual employer constructs an arrangement whereby she or a gardener or a carer sets up her own personal service company as a way of enabling the allowance to be claimed rather than being directly employed by the ultimate employer ", " yes but what about an individual personal service company ", " on the connected persons exclusion could you talk us through what you envisage happening in a situation in which there are joint ventures mergers or franchises i am thinking in particular of the mcdonald\u2019s example how will those different franchises or individual franchises be treated under the bill who will ultimately be able to claim the allowance ", " yes we will take that as a given ", " so both will be able to get up to the maximum of \u00a32 000 for the allowance in the tax year in which the merger occurs but afterwards they have to choose one or the other ", " okay this question came from the evidence session this morning it is about the different boundaries between who is and who is not eligible and the different changes that any one company might go through in the course of a tax year what consideration has hmrc given to how those boundaries will be policed ", " on clause 13 i am trying to understand the impact of the disapplication of section 4(4) of the limited liability partnerships act 2000 is the intention basically to ignore the special tax status of llps and to consider them as bodies corporate so that their members are treated as office holders of that body corporate and are therefore deemed to be employed earners for tax purposes or is it to revert to the definitions used in the social security contributions and benefits act 1992 for an  employed earner and a  self-employed earner ", " i welcome both witnesses to the committee and thank them for giving evidence today i would like to start by looking at projections for take-up of the employment allowance both witnesses will know that the allowance is the successor to the regional national insurance employers\u2019 holiday which was projected to reach 400 000 businesses but in the end was taken up by 25 000 the government have suggested that they expect up to 1 25 million businesses to benefit from the new employment allowance with a take-up of about 90% do you agree with those projections ", " that was my next question so may i ask whether mr cherry has a view about why we might not hit 100% ", " we will come back to effective communication in a few minutes at what point would you be able to say that this allowance was a success and money well spent ", " what measures should be used to quantify or evaluate the policy\u2019s impact on the economy ", " mr cherry i think that some of your members told you in a survey that they would expect the allowance to have a positive impact on jobs with some jobs created as a result after the allowance has been introduced will you do any follow-up work to see whether that remains the case ", " you spoke about effective communication in the context of the previous national insurance scheme what do you think the government need to do to ensure that this scheme will be well understood and taken up in large numbers by the business community ", " practically how best should the government be getting the message out there what do you mean by  effective communication ", " i welcome both witnesses to the committee i wanted to ask your assessment of the effectiveness of clause 12 in dealing with how the alternative investment fund managers directive interacts with current partnership tax rules secondly given that the directive was agreed in july 2011 why are we only now getting to this matter which appears to have cropped up as a side issue as part of the wider consultation on partnership tax rules ", " you said that you had your consultation in september did you say that january was when you are going to publish a policy statement ", "on the issue of fiscal steps to help people buy homes the chancellor of the exchequer said last year that people buying homes through a company to avoid tax was unacceptable and he would come down on it like a ton of bricks has he investigated reports that the under-secretary of state for transport the hon member for wimbledon (stephen hammond) has avoided tax in that way and will he come down on him like a ton of bricks ", "i salute the minister\u2019s valiant effort to gloss over recent history and his record i can tell government members that the reason their minister was not making any predictions about the impact of the policy in the bill was that he got all his previous ones wrong ", "that was a valiant effort to change the subject but today we are talking about this minister\u2019s record and the regional national insurance holiday plan i note that the minister could not bring himself to admit that the opposition were right and that he was wrong about that perhaps we can return to that point later the minister sought to focus as much as he could on the employment allowance and desperately tried to forget its predecessor scheme that the government introduced in their 2010 emergency budget the regional national insurance holiday which was enacted in the national insurance contributions act 2011 the national insurance holiday was an abject failure so i am not surprised that he wants to pretend it never happened but it did and it failed utterly he has wasted three years clinging to that policy rather than doing what opposition members told him to do which was to rip it up and design a new scheme that took account of the criticisms made by us and others the bill introduces the employment allowance which we support so perhaps we should give the minister credit for getting there in the end but it is somewhat difficult to do so because it has taken him far too long to rectify the flaws of the previous scheme which we warned him about from the beginning as my hon friend the member for nottingham east (chris leslie) has reminded him as a result businesses desperate for help have struggled in the meantime those businesses particularly small and medium-sized enterprises which are the engine of our economy have continued to suffer bank lending to smes is still contracting and analysis published by the department for business innovation and skills shows that tightening credit has disproportionately affected low and average-risk smes last year project merlin missed its target forlending to smes by more than \u00a31 billion in 2010 the office for budget responsibility predicted that lending to businesses would have risen 34% by now but in fact it has fallen by 10% given this climate of the past three years action has been necessary to support business but on national insurance it has taken the government too long to get there ", "the hon gentleman makes a fair point but there were many other problems with the national insurance holiday which i shall return to later ", "i thank the hon gentleman for that intervention but i prefer to look at the record when the government came to power they inherited a growing economy they choked off the recovery resulting in three years of flatlining and stagnation and the current cost-of-living crisis that affects businesses and people up and down the country ", "i do not think that an economy that was growing was a bad legacy to leave the legacy of three wasted years caused by the government pursuing a failed economic plan that has delivered a cost-of-living crisis for millions of people is not one to write home about ", "we have been speaking a great deal about rebalancing the economy and our proposals on regional banking for example are proof that we take the issue seriously the hon gentleman describedthis government\u2019s policy as a statement of intent but it was an absolute failure and that is the subject of the debate today the national insurance holiday was a flagship policy of the government\u2019s first budget which is why they are so desperate to forget that it happened they created a scheme that ran from 6 september 2010 until 5 september 2013 and applied to new businesses only they were eligible only if they were created after 22 june 2010 under that scheme new businesses would not have to pay the first \u00a35 000 in national insurance for each of their first 10 employees during the first year of the business greater london the south-east and the eastern region were all excluded from the scheme the government said that 400 000 businesses and some 800 000 employees would benefit from the national insurance holiday at a cost of \u00a3940 million over the three years of the scheme in their impact assessment the government confidently predicted that the average benefit per business would be about \u00a32 000 but by the end of the three years of the national insurance holiday in september this year the scheme was shown to have been a comprehensive failure in the end only 25 000 businesses received nics relief that is 375 000 fewer businesses being helped than the government originally claimed it was always highly unlikely to have ever been worth the maximum \u00a350 000 to a new start-up business to get the maximum relief available the new businesses would have had to take on 10 people with salaries of up to \u00a340 000 which does not exactly fit the pattern of how new start-ups behave and the sorts of choices that they make in their first year of business of the \u00a3940 million set aside to pay for the scheme only \u00a360 million was ultimately paid out a paltry 6% of the amount originally intended to put that in context the government spent \u00a312 million on the administration of the scheme we repeatedly warned that the scheme was not working that it was not helping businesses as intended and that the government should reform it expand it review it or bring forward a new one but they refused to listen it is not as though the minister could not see the failure unfolding before his eyes take-up of the national insurance holiday was never anything other than dismal in the first year of the scheme there was not one month in which hmrc received more than 850 applications in 2012 there was only one month when the total number of successful applications was more than 1 000 that was in may 2012 when there were 1 130 successful applications for the government\u2019s scheme to succeed they would have needed to hit that number every month for three years and they got nowhere near that when the treasury committee conducted its inquiry into the june 2010 budget the chair of the committee said for those of us who have been on the circuit a while it sounds like another case of the triumph of hope over experience how right he was ", "the hon gentleman is somewhat confused as was pointed out earlier we always said that one of the problems with the scheme was the regional element and i am coming to that point during the passage of the national insurance contributions act 2011 we told the minister that he should drop the regional condition attached to the national insurance holiday and expand it to areas of the uk that had been excluded today he brings to the house the employment allowance which does exactly that in fact the government\u2019s analysis published this morning shows that more than 40% of the expected total number of employers who will not pay any nics under the employment allowance are based in regions excluded from the previous scheme at the time the minister said that extending the national insurance holiday across the uk would increase the cost by approximately \u00a3600 million to a total of \u00a31 6 billion over three years today his employment allowance is predicted to cost \u00a31 3 billion in the first year rising to \u00a31 7 billion by 2017-18 we said that the national insurance holiday should be extended to cover all businesses rather than simply new ones today the minister is introducing an employment allowance that covers all businesses not just new businesses ", "i was proud to stand as a labour candidate at the general election when the economy was starting to grow but that recovery was choked off by the hon gentleman\u2019s government during the committee stage of the national insurance contributions act 2011 we tabled amendments to extend the national insurance holiday to charities the employment allowance will do just that this is effectively our policy so we are of course delighted to support the bill since the policy was announced in the budget we have been calling for it to be enacted immediately rather than waiting until april 2014 ", "i thank the minister for that intervention i am not surprised he wants to turn the attention away from his own u-turn i remind him that our proposal was a refinement and an extension of his failed policy we could see it was failing and doing our job as a responsible opposition we were suggesting ways in which the minister might be able to rescue hisfailed national insurance holiday i must correct him the scheme was not for small businesses only but all existing businesses ", "i am sorry that the hon gentleman is so depressed that his government\u2019s policy has failed but that is not a matter for me we will seek reassurance from the government and test the bill\u2019s provisions to ensure that the new scheme does not suffer from the problems associated with the previous scheme in particular we will scrutinise its administration the national insurance holiday was too complicated and the employment allowance should not suffer from the same problems one problem affecting take-up of the previous scheme in addition to its complexity was the lack of publicity many businesses simply did not know what was available this problem must not be repeated this is particularly important when it comes to publicising the scheme to charities and amateur sports clubs to which it now also applies they are more likely to be unaware of what is available and the government should have a clear publicity strategy subject to review if take-up is for whatever reason lower than expected clauses 9 and 10 apply the general anti-abuse rule to national insurance contributions and enable the treasury to ensure that the gaar as it applies to national insurance and to tax is kept in line we support the application of the gar to national insurance but we remain unconvinced that the current version is up to the job it is the government\u2019s flagship policy for tackling tax avoidance and their figures show that it will result in annual revenue of \u00a360 million in 2014-15 which they expect to rise to \u00a385 million by 2017-18 but that compares with a tax gap that was estimated when the gar was introduced to be \u00a332 2 billion but which has now risen to \u00a335 billion have the government thought about reassessing their figures in the light of the slightly over-enthusiastic estimates made for the uk-swiss tax agreement anyway a dent of \u00a385 million in a tax gap of \u00a335 billion is nothing to write home about the house will recall that two months ago a member of the gar independent advisory panel which decides whether people have broken the rule was forced to resign shortly after the gar came into operation having been caught advising people at a tax-planning conference how to keep their money out of the chancellor\u2019s grubby mitts this was someone who was hand-picked to advise ministers on the avoidance schemes the gar should catch we remain concerned therefore that the gar is far too narrow that there is no specific penalty regime that no arrangements are in place to monitor its effectiveness and that as a result it has little credibility we will continue to press these arguments when the bill reaches committee we welcome the introduction of a certification scheme for offshore employers of oil and gas workers the extent of this problem is significant with at least 100 000 individuals having been found to be employed through an intermediary company with no presence residence or place of business in the uk i note that this is the first of three measures aimed at tackling this issue we await the introduction of the other two by way of secondary legislation and provisions to be included in the finance bill we know from analysis published alongside the bill that the changes as a whole are expected to result in exchequer savings of \u00a380 million to \u00a3100 million a year and we will wish to review the effectiveness of these provisions as and when they come into force ", "i absolutely reject the hon gentleman\u2019s point we have a very good record on tackling tax avoidance and as i said at the moment i do not think that the gar is anything to write home about we have significant issues with it but we will return to those points in committee clauses 12 and 13 make provisions for partnership arrangements which we support we welcome the regulations that will prevent the misuse of partnerships for the purpose of tax avoidance by focusing specifically on two issues the first concerns partnerships and the tax-motivated allocation of profits and losses relating to the alternative investment fund managers directive and the second concerns limited liability partnerships and the nature of the relationship between partners and the llp focusing on the second issue the current hmrc interpretation of the existing tax rules has meant that individuals who are members of an llp are taxed as though they are partners in a partnership meaning that low-paid workers taken on as llp members have lost employment benefits and protections while at the other end of the scale high-paid workers have benefited from a self-employed status and the resulting loss of employment taxes payable it is time for the use of llps as a way to disguise employment status and avoid employment taxes to stop we note that the budget report estimated that the exchequer gains would be \u00a3125 million in 2014-15 rising to \u00a3365 million in 2015-16 and we support action in this area in conclusion key aspects of the bill began life as labour party policy so i suppose i should thank the exchequer secretary for giving us the rare pleasure of enacting legislation from opposition it is a first for me but one that i hope will happen many more times the national insurance holiday scheme was a complete failure and it is vital that the employment allowance gives businesses the support they need but it is unacceptable that they will have been waiting four years for this support three of those years were wasted while he and the government clung to the national insurance holiday scheme and almost another year has been wasted as they have failed to take immediate action instead introducing the employment allowance only from nextapril even when forced to change course and do the right thing they are still failing to go far enough and act quickly enough businesses up and down the country deserve better ", "i congratulate all the members who secured this debate and i also thank the backbench business committee for giving further time for this important issue to be discussed on the floor of the house i also want to puton record my recognition of the tremendous work done by the all-party group on interest rate swap mis-selling its efforts in campaigning on this issue since it first came to light last year have made sure it remains at the top of the political agenda i should mention in particular the hon member for aberconwy (guto bebb) for his leadership of that group and his willingness to run with this issue he opened the debate with a powerful speech touching on all the different elements of the redress scheme which have been causing problems to small businesses throughout the country he reminded the house that the banks were telling us they cannot promise that the date for full redress will be much before 2015 despite having spent \u00a3300 million and recruited around 3 000 staff to deal with this problem the number of claims settled to date is pitifully small the record on that is nothing to write home about and it needs to be dealt with urgently the chair of the backbench business committee my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire (natascha engel) made a fine speech she reminded the house that the imposition of a blanket moratorium on payments would concentrate the minds of the banks and press them towards resolving the claims businesses have made more swiftly she also made the important point that much of the language the banks are using in their correspondence with businesses and members of parliament on this issue is not easy language and that means there is a danger of the same kind of confusion arising as that which led to this scandal in the first place the hon members for wyre forest (mark garnier) and for aberconwy reminded the house that in the last 48 hours some banks have moved to decouple the issue of consequential losses from technical redress and i will return to that point my right hon friend the member for wolverhampton south east (mr mcfadden) reminded the house that this scandal has further corroded and damaged trust between banks and their customers and drew a parallel with previous scandals including the ppi scandal which certainly should concentrate minds he also reminded us that hedging and insuring against risks is not in and of itself wrong and he is certainly right about that but there has to be full understanding as to what these arrangements involve and we must make sure that when they are entered into it is done in a way that is suitable for both the companies getting involved and the banks my hon friend the member for llanelli (nia griffith) told us about the tragedy of good and very successful businesses who have been caught up in this scandal and the real fear felt by small businesses in seeking redress and how that can act as a barrier to them exercising their full rights under the redress scheme they worry about admitting something has gone wrong because of what that might mean for their future relationship with their bank that was an important point to put on the record my hon friend the member for edinburgh south (ian murray) reminded us again of the link between this scandal and the corrosion of people\u2019s trust in the banks and how that has followed on from the ppi scandal and the manipulation of libor he also said that this all feeds into a sense that the banks who are supposed to be on the side of small businesses and who clearly need small businesses as much as smallbusinesses need them have not appeared to be behaving in that way and that needs to be dealt with forthwith many government members including the hon members for poole (mr syms) for bury north (mr nuttall) for south west devon (mr streeter) and for romsey and southampton north (caroline nokes) made points about the snail\u2019s pace of this scheme which i will return to in a few moments those points were well made and i hope they are being heard on the speech by the hon member for tiverton and honiton (neil parish) i will not get into whether david felling goliath is mythological biblical or something else but the analogy was well made and the symbolism of it will resonate outside this house it is clear from today\u2019s contributions that the businesses caught up in this scandal including businesses in my constituency that are following this debate closely from a place not very far away have suffered terribly we have heard distressing stories of injustice bankruptcies job losses marriage breakdown homelessness and in some cases death today\u2019s contributions have rightly reminded the house that for all the debate about process that is incredibly important and we have to get it right there is a human cost which should not be forgotten this scandal has highlighted shocking abuse of small and medium-sized enterprises banks saw an opportunity in firms wanting to take out loans and they attached complex hedging products to them in many cases giving the impression that this was a requirement of the loan itself when interest rates plummeted businesses were forced to pick up the punitive downside of the hedges we know that in many cases banks had the option to cancel the loan so presumably at any stage when interest rates might have gone up and the business would have benefited from having the hedge the bank could cancel but in the reverse situation the business could not exit the hedge when it became unfavourable to it without incurring punitive costs and charges not only was that an extremely unfair set of terms and conditions but that behaviour violated the important relationship of trust between the banks and our small business community well run long-established small businesses which are the engine of our economy have paid the price i will not rehearse the history of how we have got to the redress process that is in place but suffice it to say that many concerns with this scheme require urgent action i hope the minister has heard all those points today and will take them away with him i hope also that the fca and the banks have been listening carefully to today\u2019s debate the biggest issue about which we have heard a great deal today is the time that this is all taking to resolve time is of the essence for the businesses concerned yet figures show that banks paid out just \u00a31 5 million in compensation in september with 22 offers being accepted that brings the grand total to a mere \u00a32 million having been paid out with 32 settled claims in september the chairman of the federation of small businesses said we are quickly losing confidence in the banks and the regulator as this scheme remains unbelievably slow the initial target indicated for the redress scheme was six months that time scale has already been missed and it now looks as if it will be missed by a very large margin one of biggest issues with the redress scheme is the complete lack of a deadline for the process last month my hon friends the members for nottingham east (chris leslie) and for chesterfield (toby perkins) wrote to the chief executive of the fca about the delay in compensation payments and requested that a strict deadline for settlement be imposed on the banks taking part in the scheme unfortunately the imposition of a deadline has been resisted by the fca that is deeply disappointing given the necessity of achieving a faster rate of progress for businesses that are in financial difficulty and the fact that the federation of small businesses has indicated that some reviews of the interest rate swap products could be completed in as little as four to six weeks i am sure the minister will agree that firms that are due redress must receive it as quickly as possible if they are to survive they need certainty and clarity so that they can plan for the future does he agree that a deadline would help matters i hope he will respond to that point will he outline for us what he might do to bring that about we have seen some movement in the past 48 hours on the issue of consequential losses which is very welcome however it is important that all the banks that have not signed up to the decoupling arrangement in respect of consequential loss and technical redress do so as quickly as possible as this is now an evolving element of the redress scheme will the minister confirm that he will follow it closely to ensure that the evolving process will still allow for a fair assessment of consequential losses and that there is no risk that businesses will opt to forgo money they are owed in order to obtain compensation for their direct losses more quickly we also heard a lot about the suspension of payments an issue about which many hon members have been writing to banks in our capacity as constituency members of parliament clearly there is some inconsistency in the way in which the suspension of payments is being applied will the minister undertake to do whatever he can to ensure that the suspension of payments applies wherever it is necessary will he consider the threshold will he eliminate the requirement for the business to go into special measures as that is clearly holding some people back a huge amount of data have been published by the fca on its website which is helping members of this house to assess the progress of this scheme however i wonder whether there is scope for some of those datasets to be expanded particularly to give members more information about what is happening to businesses in financial distress and businesses in administration so that there is no incentive for banks to not bother dealing with them as we have heard discussed today small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy they account for about half of private sector turnover employ millions of people and make up 99% of uk enterprises they deserve to be treated better by our financial institutions and to be supported and protected more effectively by both the regulators and the government i hope that the minister can provide some much-needed assurance and that the fca and the banks take on board all the points made by hon members today ", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what recent reports he has

department of health he will be aware that the chief executive of the association of medical research charities has described the proposed move as a  fudge that will threaten the independence of

member for cambridge (dr huppert) said we will be going into the comprehensive spending review period later this month i congratulate him on securing the debate he is right that we had to postpone our campaign for science and engineering debate so it is good to pick up some of the issues here this afternoon that we would have discussed in that perhaps more adversarial format as i scientist before he became a member the hon gentleman has a deep commitment to this policy area occasionally i gently point out to him that he is a coalition member although not himself in government his party is but it sometimes feels as though he is making a pitch from outside the government rather than from within he has a consistent record of arguing for the points that he makes the hon gentleman gave the example of cambridge and as its mp he obviously has a very strong story to tell he has a truly world-class university and truly world-class companies on his patch that are doing great business for uk plc by pushing the boundaries of invention and innovation i will duck the opportunity of trying to get my tongue around his twister of ships and chips and so on but the company that he mentioned is good not just for his region but for the country and our whole standing the hon gentleman also made some important points about innovation as distinct from the overall funding that we provide for science and research he talked about the incredible importance of the european union and the money that it makes available for science and research the uk punches above its weight as it does in so many other areas in terms of attracting that investment although this is not the place to talk about referendums and our future relationship with the european union let me just say that many in the science community support our continued eu membership they know how important it is to the framework of science and research in our country the hon gentleman also made some good points about people that i will come to later in my contribution given that the comprehensive spending review is looming we cannot help but talk about the money side of things i hope that the minister will use some of the points that are made to him today to arm him as he and the business secretary go into those difficult discussions with the chancellor of the exchequer it is true that we are at a critical juncture for the future of science andresearch in our country it is unclear whether we will be able to retain and grow our standing in the world or whether we will fall behind in this aspect of the global race as the royal society says we must keep running just to stand still that is the scale of the challenge that we face and something that must be in the mind of the minister the business secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer as they make their decisions in a few weeks\u2019 time i am sure the minister will talk about the government\u2019s ring-fencing and protection of the science budget thus far in this parliament however he will recognise as i hope the hon member for cambridge will too that the true picture is not all that rosy although many in the science community are genuinely grateful for the deal that the minister and the business secretary achieved for science on the grounds that it could have been a lot worse some significant issues about the funding of science still cannot be ignored the reality is that we are in danger of losing our standing as a world leader for science and innovation because of the cumulative effect of a short-termist piecemeal approach which is underpinned by real-terms cuts in the science budget the minister will accept the research by the library and the campaign for science and engineering that shows the 14% real-terms cut in the science budget thus far and the impact that that will have on our capacity to keep up with our competitors not only was this flat cash settlement an actual cut but the science budget itself only represents about 50% of government science spending as we all know science spending has been hit in other ways too for example the scrapping of the regional development agencies which spent something like \u00a3440 million per annum on science-related programmes before the last csr round has led to another reduction in funding furthermore capital spending which the hon gentleman mentioned was cut at the beginning of this parliament by 40% a total of \u00a31 4 billion it is fair to say that the minister and the business secretary have worked hard on this matter and implored the chancellor to put back some of that money as the hon member for cambridge pointed out we all know that we are still some \u00a3300 million short the boldness of the decision to cut capital spending by 40% has not been met by a boldness of action to put it back despite the fact that a mistake was made and that it should be rectified we are seeing a piecemeal and unco-ordinated way of putting back some of that money researchers and industry need a clear investment framework on which they can rely to plan properly for the long term the long term really matters in science the big projects that have been making the news recently such as the work being done at cern or at the crick institute did not come to life at the beginning of one parliament and complete their cycle at the end of that parliament these are things that take five 10 15 or 20 years in the planning the doing the inventing and the innovating and then we hope in the finding of successful outcomes a clear long-term framework is very important to the science community one government decision that i have the most difficulty with and that we would seek to change if we were to form the next government would be the scrapping of labour\u2019s 10-year investmentframework what we have seen is a return to a short-term spending cycle as i have said researchers and industry need a long-term vision so that they can plan over time although we had a 10-year spending cycle when we were in government the royal society has called for a 15-year period and there are others who would argue for longer still it is clear that long-termism is needed the result of a short-termist piecemeal approach is that the uk is falling behind other countries when it comes to investment in science i am afraid to say that the government have also backed away from any commitment to meeting the lisbon 2020 target of 3% investment in r and d that they had publicly accepted even allowing for the current economic situation we have not been given any goal or even heard how we might catch up in future years it would be good if we were able to get some detail on that so that even allowing for the current decisions over how we meet the country\u2019s fiscal challenges we may at least be able to say when we return to growth that there is some plan for catching up that target many of our international competitors are increasing their science budgets even those with their own deficit reduction programmes i come back to the point made by the royal society that we have to keep running just to stand still and keeping up with our competitor countries really matters the overall condition of our essential research infrastructure will decline without long-term investment so scrimping on maintenance capital now will progressively affect research it will build an investment backlog for the future and it will negatively affect our ability to attract and retain the best global talent the low level of investment now is not sustainable and it is storing up problems for future governments if we have any hope of maintaining our world leading position in science i hope that we can all agree that we should try to maintain that position we do science well in this country i often say that it should be a bigger part of our national narrative we often talk about the british as the underdogs in business punching above our weight but our world-class higher education sector and our capacity to do science are essential parts of the british story when it comes to higher education in particular we are the preferred educators of the world that is why so many international students want to come to our country we are also recognised as leading scientists and thinkers so our capacity to innovate is something that is appreciated by the rest of the world it is a competitive advantage and something that we should put front and centre of how we plan to be a major economic force in the middle part of this century there is a lot of rhetoric around the global race in political terms it is a sexy thing to talk about but it needs to be backed up with some action i fear that at the moment the short-termist approach will prevent us from being in a position in which we can say that we are going to win the global race ", "i thank the hon gentleman for that intervention he will not be shocked to hear that i am not going to give a spending commitment for what a labour government would do in 2015 however the broader point is that long-termism is not just about the headline amount given to science saying  this is your deal for 10 or maybe 15 years off you go is also important because it encourages private sector investment the private sector will know that a government are serious about science and it will know what will happen if they stay in power at the next election that certainty breeds greater investment and it will offer a much better deal i cannot of course give the exact sums that we will allocate when we i hope form the government in 2015 but we will return to that theme as we continue to debate these important issues let me move away from the size of the budget and the length of the spending cycle on which it is based the hon gentleman talked a lot about people and that is a really important part of science policy although we often forget that when we are grappling with the overall sums and how long they are allocated for in particular he raised a really important point about women in science which is something i have picked up on since i took up the science bit of my brief my predecessor my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central (chi onwurah) was a female scientist so she had experience of being a woman in what is very much a man\u2019s world i pay tribute to her work as a woman in science and a woman who speaks up for science and scientific issues there is clearly a problem if we cannot ensure that we take forward the best talent that we have and make the most of it we are truly missing out on something that should be a competitive advantage many in the science community tell me that the problem is often less about getting women into undergraduate science degree programmes and more about retaining them once they have graduated when they are trying to plot their careers as researchers and academics and to combine their work with family life and career breaks to have children i have said a number of times that the issue is not unique to the scientific community it is a problem across our society and those of us in the world of politics know only too well the difficulties that political parties of all persuasions have in attracting female talent into politics and in ensuring that women can progress to the very top in much the same way as men this is therefore a cross-sector societal issue and it is important for the science community too in the few months that i have had this brief i am pleased that so many people not just women have wanted to talk to me about women in science and about how we can do more to attract and equally importantly retain female talent in the science pool i was sad to see the government withdraw funding from the uk resource centre for women in science engineering and technology which was set up when the labour party was in government to encourage more women into stem subjects if the government scrap something and replace it with something else i guessthat they have an argument that they are still committed to the agenda but there is no plan b when it comes to scrapping the ukrc\u2019s funding i would therefore like to hear a bit more from the minister about his plans regarding women in science and how he sees things developing how will he ensure that we meet the challenge of not only getting women into science but retaining them the hon gentleman made a broader point about inspiring our young people and children into careers in science and about making science fun one of my best visits since becoming a member of parliament was the morning i spent at the big bang science fair a few months ago tens of thousands of children were part of the fair and experienced it it was incredible to see the energy in the docklands arena as those young people were exposed to science and scientific ideas one thing that really struck me was a project that had been entered into one of the many competitions being run at the fair a group of young girls had done a study of the science behind hair straightening some of the women reading or listening to the debate will recognise that hair straightening is a big industry and it is certainly something a lot of women grapple with it might not affect the minister or the hon gentleman quite so much but i know a lot about it it was really interesting that the young girls could take something that mattered to them they talked about the protective qualities of the different serums that they can put on their hair to protect it from the intense heat that they apply when they use a hair straightener and understand that there is a lot of science behind it they were able to study understand and relate that to their own lives that was a powerful way to show them that science is all around them and that it is not a scary dry arid austere thing that only geeky boys do when they are at school but an exciting challenging thing that they use every day often without realising it lots of good work is therefore being done to make science fun for our young people although we can always do more i sympathise greatly with the hon gentleman\u2019s point about specialist science teaching in our primary schools the campaign for science and engineering has spoken to me a number of times about the issue which is part of a campaign that it is running i am very sympathetic to the hon gentleman\u2019s suggestion and i am involved in discussions with the shadow education team about how we might make it happen however i absolutely agree with the broad principle because we need people who understand science and who are passionate about it to be there right from the beginning of the educational journey that our young children make if we are to make sure that they do not drop science as soon as they turn 14 when they have to decide which options to take the hon gentleman also touched on the impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies on science and the wider higher education sector when i was promoted to the position of shadow higher education minister i had no idea that my previous experience as a shadow minister in the home office team would be quite so relevant but somebody will talk to me about the impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies almost every week the minister and the business secretary are very sympathetic regarding the problems that have been visited on the higher education sector and the science community as a result of the government\u2019s immigrationpolicy and i suspect that we are often on the same side when we talk about the fact that the impact has been negative and that we need to change things unfortunately to date we have been unable to persuade the home office and downing street to change course why is that important because the government\u2019s pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands can be achieved only if they dramatically reduce the number of legitimate international students who come to our country and only if they sit back and pray that lots of british people leave this country while lots of brits living abroad do not come back we cannot get away from that fact on the other things that impact on net migration figures such as family migration the government have limited rights of appeal and so on but they cannot do any more without falling foul of human rights law they cannot outlaw people from having any kind of family life whatever or from marrying spouses from abroad that leaves international students as the one group the government can decrease significantly to meet their target we are in the bizarre position that the government are holding up as a sign of success the fact that net migration has dropped but missing out the fact that that is entirely down to brits not coming home brits leaving and legitimate international students not coming to our country to study our competitors are absolutely rubbing their hands with glee over this i met some colleagues from australia a couple of weeks ago the first thing that they said was  thank you you have done such a great job we made a huge mistake by trying to reduce the number of our legitimate international foreign students we were starting to pay the price but then you guys did the same thing and now they are all coming back to us that is a problem ", "there has been a drop in net migration and there is a flux backwards in relation to international students the overall picture of what has happened in the past three years since the policy was introduced has been to create a perception that britain does not want to educate international students and does not draw a distinction between legitimate international students and those who are here illegitimately or illegally the london metropolitan university affair did great damage to our standing in the world our competitors have picked up on that and marketing departments in universities in canada australia and america are homing in on it it is the one thing that every higher education institution in this country whether a leading russell group institution a million+ institution part of the university alliance or something else has said is a big problem every part of the sector has been affected by the immigration policy and it affects scientific talent as well ", "to focus on how we measure the net migration target is to miss the point about what has happened the government have picked a target it does not particularly matter what goes into the target as long as the sole immigration policy is not just to set an arbitrary target limit net migration is a useful measure of influxes into a country and outflows and a useful way for public bodies for example to try to work out the future pattern and shape of public services i am not too fixated on how net migration is measured there is merit in universities that want to increase the number of their legitimate international students engaging in a numbers-based conversation with their local authorities so that bus routes and housing need can be planned there is merit therefore in the way net migration is measured for that purpose but there is a problem if the measure of success is whether it is reduced to tens of thousands that pledge was made in the knowledge that the only way to get net migration down would be by significantly affecting the number of legitimate international students coming to the country the minister must recognise that if the number of such students continues to rise the net migration pledge will not be met we must stop sending out the message that the country is not open for business as i was saying before i took the intervention that point is important for science as well when some of the world\u2019s best scientists and their research teams decide where they may spend the next 10 to 20 years of their careers it is important that the country should attract scientific talent and be an easy and welcoming place to come to with an atmosphere of celebration of the contribution made by people who come if the overall offer from britain is a bit mealy-mouthed and negative or rather a lot negative given some of the rhetoric of the past months and if the immense contribution made by those who come legitimately from abroad to study or work in our country is not valued in words and actions we face a significant problem ", "that is an important point higher education is our seventh largest export a fact that shocked me when i took on the brief i did not know that at the time it is worth billions of pounds to the country at a time when we are desperate for economic growth the deliberate shutting down of one of our largest export industries is a big problem part of the issue is our reputation we have been a destination of choice because of not just the excellence of our institutions which are world leaders but what the country is and hasstood for in the world the english language means that there is already an affinity between our country and many others our offer contains something bigger beyond the brilliance of our higher education and science sector to do with what we stand for the rhetoric of the past few months has failed to draw a distinction between legitimate concerns about public services the pace of change the nature of identity and community and the things that are important for our continued economic standing also there is a soft power that comes from having educated people who will be the leading business men and women of future and growing economies we are missing out i implore the government as i have many times to change course and bring some sense back to the immigration debate i urge them to focus on things that people in ladywood tell me they are bothered about illegal immigration which seems to have dropped off the radar if everything is about net migration the government appear not to be particularly focused on enforcing rules that would clamp down on illegal immigration or on making sure when people are found to be here illegally that they are quickly deported i have for months been telling the uk border agency about some constituency cases in which people are here illegally and nothing has been done yet international students are being put off coming to study in this country it is a bizarre state of affairs and i wish that the government would bring some sense back to that policy area the hon member for cambridge referred to postgraduates and their funding universities have for months been telling me that early indications of the impact of the government\u2019s new \u00a39 000 fees regime are that there is upward pressure on the postgraduate student market as additional study now seems much less affordable for a generation of students that will graduate with a large debt that is a problem that universities have been flagging up for a while by 2015 the first cohort of students under the new regime will graduate there is a danger that their future decisions about whether to pursue postgraduate study will be inhibited by the view that it will be unaffordable many people have therefore talked as the hon member for cambridge did about an income-contingent loan system for postgraduate study the minister and i have debated postgraduate funding before in westminster hall and recognised that it poses a significant challenge at a time of economic difficulty however we need to grapple with the supply of graduates into postgraduate study if we fall behind that will affect our future research base ", "the hon gentleman is right to point out that postgraduate study is not only something that people take on immediately after their first degree the conversations that i have had with universities in the past few months have been particularly about the additional pressure from the new fees regime and how they think that it will inhibit future student behaviour so the universities are thinking five to 10 years ahead as they consider the overall health of the uk research base which they are right to do ", "i thank my hon friend for that intervention he is right to make that point one of the things that lots of business leaders in particular have been talking to me about in the last few months has been that in previous recessions some of our biggest companies would have sent some of their work force back into additional study to expand their skills in the hope that by the time those workers finished their studies the companies might be on an upswing again and benefit from having refreshed and re-energised workers who would have had the opportunity to go out there and explore new ideas that has been missing from the behaviour of big companies in this recession so there are changes in how people are reacting to the current recession the squeeze on living standards and the way in which they are making decisions about study and improving their qualifications people from all parties have to grapple with that issue because it is in all our interests to ensure that the uk has a properly qualified labour market that can meet our future needs that is not just an investment for now it involves thinking about what people will be doing years from now i often say to young people i meet that the jobs they will be doing in 20 years\u2019 time probably have not yet been invented the pace of change is very quick and the ability of our work force to refresh and renew their skills quickly is becoming ever more urgent i will finish my remarks by returning to money given that the comprehensive spending review is looming in just a couple of weeks\u2019 time i hope that the minister is able to continue to make the argument for science he is a supporter of science and his work supporting science has been much appreciated by people in the science community i hope that he is able to continue to make the case for science but i also hope that he is able to argue for something that looks like a much longer-term approach so that we get away from a piecemeal  let\u2019s just survive this year or this parliament approach and consider having a bigger and bolder statement about how this country truly thinks it will win the global race the time has come for rhetoric to start to match reality if not to match reality completely the minister would not expect me to say that it would completelymatch reality because we are after all the opposition nevertheless i hope that we can get to a place where rhetoric starts to match reality and that we will be truly able to say in the middle of this century that we still hope to be a global power punching above our weight and doing science well ", "i am grateful for the opportunity albeit time-limited and short to contribute to the debate on the gracious speech we as a country face huge challenges and those faced by my constituents and the people of birmingham are acute my constituents are getting poorer and my constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the country youth unemployment is at 8 4% in ladywood and long-term unemployment has gone up more and more of my constituents are dependent on food banks that operate in my constituency and my advice surgeries are inundated with people who cannot make ends meet and for whom simply keeping a roof over their heads and putting food on the table is a serious struggle that is the reality of 21st-century britain after three years of this government given the scale of the challenge faced by the country and the reality of what the last three years have meant for my constituents we needed a change of direction in the queen\u2019s speech and bold action to kick-start our economy we desperately needed a jobs bill we have an unemployment emergency in this country and there are simply not enough jobs to go around instead of acting quickly and decisively as required by such an emergency the government are content to trundle along at a pedestrian pace doing a bit here and not going quite far enough there as if they have all the time in the world or more likely two years to kill before the next general election my constituents however do not have the luxury of time to waste the government do not realise that each day one of my constituents remains unemployed there is a clear and present danger to their chances of ever being able to find work and the longer that goes on the more likely it is that they will be for ever on the fringes of the labour market as individuals my constituents will pay a heavy price but so will the country a lost generation is not only a tragedy for those unfortunate enough to be among their number but frankly it does not come cheap my constituents were crying out for a jobs bill something that would have given a chance of work to young people who have been unemployed for more than a year and a compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed who have been out of work for more than two years the scale of the challenge demanded that but the government failed to deliver i am also disappointed that the government\u2019s proposals contained no reference to using public procurement to boost apprenticeship places again that is a missed opportunity to put a rocket booster under apprenticeship policy the government have real power in the market they are the uk\u2019s biggest consumer and should use it strategically and for the good of the country in march the government voted against the opposition\u2019s plans to use public procurement contracts worth more than \u00a31 million to create apprenticeship places the government could make a difference i do not understand why they will not accept my point and weave it into procurement policy it is no good them praying in aid eu law because other european countries have been able to take into account the impact of procurement decisions on the local economic environment and remain within its confines in the absence of an effective speedy and decisive response to the emergency we face we in birmingham are still trying to make a difference my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston (ms stuart) deserves special mention for the work she has spearheaded on the birmingham labour party policy review of education and skills in our city the review culminated in a process to create a birmingham baccalaureate which will embed in the core school curriculum both generic employability skills and sector-specific skills in areas where birmingham hopes to grow i hope that with the process we have embarked on towards a birmingham baccalaureate we can address the skills disconnect in our city and move to a position in which young brummies are first in line for the jobs that are created in our great city in addition the greater birmingham and solihull local enterprise partnership and the city council await the spending review in june to see how much money the government will put into the single local growth fund however the government\u2019s approach to regional growth so far has created uncertainty deterred investment and held back regional and local economies i agree that local areas should have the powers and resources they need to get growth going and create jobs but devolution should not be used as a cover for even deeper cuts i welcome any progress we can make in birmingham working with the council the lep and other stakeholders to address our skills gap and get more brummies into work but we will not achieve the jobs revolution we need without the government taking bold and decisive action that is why a plan for jobs and full employment should have been at the heart of the queen\u2019s speech the queen\u2019s speech failed to deliver it my constituents birmingham and our country deserve better ", "the minister tries to paint a rosy picture but the facts are that the recent drop in net migration is due to 38 000 fewer international students coming to this country his policy is choking growth in our seventh-largest export industry worth billions of pounds at a time when our economy is flatlining it is clear that the minister is too weak to make the case for our world-class universities around the world and too weak to lobby his government colleagues to change course does

applications have dropped by 54 000 which is 11% acceptances are down as are the numbers of mature learners and part-time learners his core and margin policy has caused nothing but chaos and confusion his aab policy has been a dramatic failure and to top it all off legitimate international students are choosing to go to our competitor countries to study as a result of home office policies is not the truth that the past two years under this government have been a disaster for students and universities alike ", "may i remind the secretary of state that birmingham\u2019s finances became a mess under a coalition of conservatives and liberal democrats and that it is a labour administration that since may has been trying to put that right however birmingham is facing some of the biggest cuts in local government history with a reduction in income of \u00a3149 per person which is more than double the national average will he meet me and adelegation of members of parliament from birmingham

government\u2019s higher education funding policy is staring to unravel the office for budget responsibility has shown that tuition fees count towards inflation and will add 0 2 percentage points to the consumer prices index in the fourth quarter of this year so the impact of the government\u2019s policies not only will be felt by students but will have wider implications because cpi is the measure by which public pensions and benefits are increased annually the government\u2019s welfare bill and civil service pensions will be affected at next year\u2019s annual uprating therefore does the minister accept that his policies are disastrous not only for students but for government finances in general and what conversations is he having with other departments about mitigating that ", "to ask the secretary of state for education which universities he has visited in the last 12 months ", "will the secretary of state say how many firearms licences have been issued by the police for the culls and at what cost ", "the minister has tried to defend his \u00a39k policy but has avoided saying anything about the 80% cut to teaching grant funding which has necessitated the trebling of tuition fees to \u00a39 000 a year what does he have to say about that ", "will the minister give way ", "i thank the minister for giving way a second time will he remind the house why he had to introduce his core and margin model does he remember telling the house on many occasions that \u00a39k fees would be the exception not the norm ", "i am very happy to intervene on the minister and i can absolutely guarantee that what he is missing in his desperate attempt to attack the much more progressive \u00a36 000 fee proposal is that it would automatically obviate the need for quite so many fee waivers and bursaries created by his more expensive system of tuition fees ", "the position of bursaries would be unaffected under the \u00a36 000 proposal we are saying that the additional cost incurred by moving to \u00a39 000 tuition fees would be brought down we would not need quite so much money because people would not have the same level of debt ", "i beg to move that this house notes with concern that september 2012 marks the first term where students will face the trebling of student fees to \u00a39 000 a year further notes that barriers are also being put up for vocational routes with direct government support for learners cut for level 3 courses and above which includes apprenticeships and access courses to university and with higher education-style loans being introduced costing learners up to \u00a34 000 a year and calls on the government to change course and as a first step reduce tuition fees to \u00a36 000 funded by reversing the corporation tax cut for banks and requiring graduates earning over \u00a365 000 a year to pay higher interest rates on their student loans in just over a week university freshers weeks will kick off in earnest ahead of the new academic year new students will soon start arriving at their institutions excited nervous and full of anticipation and hope for their futures as they look forward to three maybe four of the best years of their life they do so against a backdrop of confidence in the quality of our world-class higher education sector which collectively will do all it can to give them the best possible higher education experience but this year is also markedly different for this year we will see the first cohort of students who as a result of the government\u2019s action will be paying tuition fees of up to \u00a39 000 a year and leaving university with significant debts which for some will exceed \u00a350 000 until the government changed the rules of the game higher education had been paid for by a partnership between the student and taxpayer since 1998 but this government\u2019s trebling of tuition fees in conjunction with their 80% cut in the teaching grant for universities represents a betrayal of future generations of students the partnership model for funding has been torn up and students have been told to go it alone they must bear the burden of the cost entirely on their own we all know that this is not what the liberal democrats said they would do before the general election ", "if the hon gentleman had not decided to patronise me at the beginning of his intervention he might have had enough time to complete his mini-speech i will move on later to the record drops we have seen inthe number of applications including from mature students and the increase in the withdrawal rate for students who have been offered university places but decided not to take them which stands in direct contrast to the rather more rosy picture he is trying to paint as i was saying the liberal democrats went into the 2010 general election promising to scrap tuition fees altogether we all remember that famous pledge but they broke their promise and the trust of those who voted for them and betrayed the students whose votes they courted so assiduously ahead of the election i wonder how many of them will rediscover their pre-election principles in the lobbies tonight although the conservatives are no doubt pleased that most of the anger surrounding the betrayal on tuition fees has focused on the liberal democrats they too have form having previously voted against a rise in tuition fees to \u00a33 000 ", "both the motion and our alternative proposal for the government of a \u00a36 000 cap on fees reflect our position as it relates to england not the devolved administrations the conservatives and the liberal democrats have played politics with tuition fees in the past and it is students today who are paying the price ", "the right hon gentleman\u2019s party went into the 2010 general election promising to scrap tuition fees at a time when they knew the country faced a difficult economic situation so i am afraid that he cannot escape his own record by looking to much older parliaments we are talking about the burden of debt that this government have placed on students which is much more significant than anything they faced before ", "the principle that those who benefit should pay a contribution towards their degree is absolutely right and one we support but we believe that paying for higher education should be a partnershipbetween the individual student who benefits and the taxpayer who also benefits greatly from those going into higher education ", "our proposal that the government should reduce the headline level of tuition fees from \u00a39 000 to \u00a36 000 is an alternative measure that they could introduce right now paid for by not going ahead with the corporation tax cut for the banks it would be a way for the government to send a message to the country that they will support future generation of students rather than saddle them with ever higher levels of debt as for those earning \u00a365 000 or more that reflects earnings in each and every year of their working lives all we are asking is that the wealthiest 10% of graduates pay a little more towards the cost of higher education in order to reduce the costs for those elsewhere ", "i will make a little progress before giving way again the biggest impact has been on the number of applicants although applications for the coming term are still open we already know that there are around 50 000 fewer applications to higher education for the coming year and that one in 20 18-year-olds who would have been expected to apply in previous years have not applied this time around which represents a decline of around 15 000 i am told by the sector that total accepted applications are down by about 30 000 on last year that is equivalent to shutting down two mid-sized universities for example imperial college and the university of lincoln ", "not at the moment that is set against a backdrop of a worsening economic outlook as a result of the government\u2019s failed economic policies the economy is in a double-dip recession made in downing street we know that there is a strong link between periods of recession and interest in higher education as people seek to enhance their employability and competitiveness in difficult economic circumstances but this year that is not the case there is a massive drop that combined with cuts in the number of places will result in tens of thousands fewer students entering higher education in 2012 it indicates straight away the impact of the government\u2019s trebling of tuition fees students are being put off and are basing decisions not on whether a university education is right for them but on whether they can afford it that is a tragedy for boththe person making the decision and the country as a whole because if they miss out on higher education we miss out by failing to capture their full potential ", "and if the hon gentleman\u2019s party took on board our \u00a36k proposal there would be an even more progressive system for future generations of students cost is the real problem the centre for economic performance recently surveyed 12 000 teenagers and found that all the indications are that the hike in fees in late 2010 increased the perception that going to university is simply too expensive that perception was significantly higher in comprehensive schools compared with independent and selective state schools and among children eligible for free school meals if these perceptions influence effort at school or behaviour post-16 they will increase future socio-economic inequality mature students are one of the worst affected groups as many more are choosing not to go to university this year the government failed to take into account the effects of their policies on that group and we have seen an 11 3% drop in such applications making them the biggest group affected there are around 30 000 fewer older applicants this year than last year ", "my hon friend makes an extremely powerful point i agree with her comment and endorse it entirely too often we in this house consider higher education issues through the prism of the 18-year-old undergraduate going to university for the first time although the experience of such undergraduates is of course incredibly important we know from the figures that in 2009-10 more than a third of undergraduates entering university for the first time were 21 or older the impact of the trebling of tuition fees on that group is particularly interesting as their perspective and actual experience of debt and finance are very different these are people who often have significant financial and family commitments with mortgages to pay and child care costs if they are making a decision to walk away from enhancing their skills by obtaining a degree they are doing so on the basis of cost there is a much higher rate of withdrawals from the application process this year than last year 16% higher at this stage 13 138 students who are holding offers from universities have decided to withdraw from the process that is an extremely worrying sign that students who had already made the decision to go to university are now being put off having attended open days filled outapplications and gone to interviews they are now saying  no thanks where will they end up what are their prospects for the future given the record levels of youth unemployment and the ongoing recession ", "not at the moment reading the government\u2019s amendment one would think that there were no problems with their policy whatsoever and that it has had hardly any impact further proof if any were needed that they are complacent and out of touch ", "i am not going to take any more interventions at the moment i will do so later the government try to explain away the impact of their choices by saying that the drops in applications are due to the decline in the population of 18-year-olds however that does not get them off the hook because as the independent commission on fees pointed out in its recent report in the rest of the uk where the fees regime has remained the same there has not been the same drop in applications ", "the hon lady makes a very powerful point and she is entirely right in her conclusions the independent commission on fees found that in scotland wales and northern ireland the number of applicants aged 20 or over increased between 2010 and 2012 while by contrast in england they fell by 12% the number of younger applicants those aged up to 19 fell by 7% but by only 1% to 2% in the other home countries although population size could be a factor the report found that the relative decline in english applications was much higher that raises concerns about the impact of fees because there are falls in the number of applicants both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the uk ", "i have taken an intervention from the hon member for stratford-on-avon (nadhim zahawi) so i give way to the hon member for winchester (steve brine) ", "i am glad that i gave another hon gentleman an opportunity to make a mini-speech if only the experience of the whole of the higher education sector was the same as that in winchester ", "i am afraid not i have no desire to respond to a whips\u2019 question the trebling of fees is not the only thing that this government have done to destabilise and put at risk the quality of our higher education sector ", "my hon friend is absolutely right there are worrying signs of perverse things happening as a result of the government\u2019s policies of course there has been a focus on stem subjects science technology engineering and maths which are very important to our continued economic growth but that should not happen at the expense of modern languages or humanities it is very worrying that we are seeing drops in the number of applications for those subjects ", "i thank my hon friend for raising the subject of international students which has been much in the news recently with the case of london metropolitan university i have written to the minister for universities and science with some detailed questions about the handling of the london met affair i have yet to receive a response but i very much look forward to it given that at last week\u2019s business innovation and skills questions he ducked the opportunity to promise that no genuine international student at london metropolitan university would be financially worse off perhaps he would like to intervene now to confirm that that will be the case but i see that he is not going to do so ", "my right hon friend who is chair of the home affairs committee has been speaking up powerfully on behalf of genuine international students at london metropolitan university and i commend him for his efforts in trying to protect them from the impact of the decision to revoke its highly trusted status he is absolutely right genuine international students who have paid huge sums of money for the privilege of a uk higher education and who have come to the end or almost the end of their studies at london met should at least have been given the opportunity to continue and complete them there rather than have to scramble around to find an alternative institution that might take them it seems entirely right that new international students are prevented from coming to london met until these issues are resolved probably through the courts system but those who were already here and were genuine international students should not have had to suffer in this way this is one of the hardest years for universities which begin the year 20 000 places down thanks to 10 000 places being directly cut by the government and a further 10 000 being taken away because of the discredited and frankly chaotic core and margin policy core and margin was a deliberate attempt to force fees down but crucially not to benefit students but because the minister got his sums wrong when he the business secretary who is sitting next to him the deputy prime minister and the prime minister were busy telling everybody that \u00a39 000 would be the exception rather than the norm and that the average would be much more like \u00a37 500 we now know that that is not how things panned out to cover that up and no doubt to get the treasury off his back the minister introduced his core and margin policy that policy does not put students at the heart of the system first it sends a dangerously conflicting message about the cost of tuition on the one hand the government tell students that they can afford \u00a39 000 a year because of the repayment terms but on the other they try to show that cheaper courses are a good option for those put off by the top level of \u00a39 000 it also acts as an inverse pupil premium incentivising poorer students to take up cheaper courses means that they are entering into a higher education experience with the least being spent on them their learning resources their activities and their institution this undermines the deputy prime minister\u2019s pupil premium policy and there is a risk that it will further entrench educational inequality in the uk ", "i thank my hon friend for his question which the government have managed to duck through their refusal to introduce a higher education bill in this parliament frankly they were taught a very hard lesson on the health and social care bill and other reforms that they have tried to make so they have bottled it on higher education which means that there are regulatory gaps in the system i and others in the sector have warned that regulation is incredibly important to the reputation of our higher education sector and that the government should not miss an opportunity to ensure that the regulatory system for all providers of higher education in our country is robust and represents a fair and level playing field the core and margin model further undermines the idea of student choice the policy makes a mockery of the minister\u2019s ambition to put students at the heart of the system because it artificially takes places away from institutions that have high demand for their courses to much lower-demand colleges it is incoherent hypocritical bad for students and bad for universities alongside the core and margin model the government have removed a number of controls for recruitment at grades aab as a result of the plan to go down to abb next year again the implementation of the numbers control policy poses a threat to the stability of the higher education sector ", "i thank my right hon friend for his intervention in fact i visited sheffield hallam university during universities week and the academic staff i met made exactly the same point to me the way in which the government have gone about making their changes to higher education with the introduction of the core and margin model after applications had been made and after fees for the academic year had been set was chaotic caused universities no end of difficulties and is absolutely not the way to treat a world-class higher education system last year\u2019s estimate of the number of students who would fall into the grade aab category was 20 000 lower than what transpired when the results came out a few weeks ago that places a considerable burden on the student support budget which cannot properly be planned and risks exacerbating funding pressures on top of the points that my hon friend has made about sheffield hallam university there is a considerable risk that the nature of equivalent qualifications a distinction for a btec for example will be counted in with the aab-plus grading means that estimates will be very difficult to calculate and are highly likely to be inaccurate this adds yet more uncertainty and instability to a sector already fraught with upheaval institutions will lose out budgets will not stretch and services and support for students will be put under significant strain the early indication is that the policy is not working the vice-chancellor of southampton told the press last week that his university which was meant to benefit from the aab policy has been struggling to recruit and is about 600 students down i have visited southampton university with my hon friend the shadow business secretary it is an excellent institution and i am sorry to see that it is facing such difficult circumstances as a result of the government\u2019s ill-thought-out and ill-planned policies on the heels of the trebling of tuition fees and the scrapping of the education maintenance allowance from 2013-14 the government are withdrawing the support that they offer for people aged 24 or over who take a-level equivalent courses and above and are introducing a system of loans for further education students these could be as much as \u00a34 000 a year course fees are expected to rise dramatically as colleges look to recoup the money they lose from government funding at present the government provide about 50% of the funding for such courses so this mirrors the problems that occurred as a result of their disastrous changes to higher education loans according to the skills funding agency\u2019s figures about 376 000 people took such courses in 2010-11 the changes could have a real and damaging effect on social mobility and on individuals\u2019 career and job prospects it is an attack on aspiration and on people trying to get on many of those taking level 3 qualifications missed out on the opportunities the first time around and may come from disadvantaged backgrounds ", "i thank my hon friend for her intervention she is absolutely right as i have said choices that are being made on the basis of affordability represent a tragedy not just for the individual making them but for us as a country because we are missing out on their potential at a time when we should be investing in our education and skills base in a highly skilled economy we need our people to have high-level skills this government are creating circumstances in which that will not be possible in the future this government\u2019s policies will affect level 3 apprenticeships for those aged 24 and over the added costs could act as a deterrent for potential apprentices and the added bureaucracy could put off businesses from offering places a high percentage of learners are also enrolled in courses directly related to or benefiting public services for example just over 90 000 learners were enrolled incourses in health public services and care and over 45 000 in those for education and training sixty three per cent of those affected are women a drop-off from those numbers would hit local services and local economic growth prospects could hit the productivity of the public sector and the life chances of tens of thousands of adult learners the policy will also affect those taking courses in science technology engineering and maths when we need more people not fewer to take stem subjects in order to compete in the world with new technology and new industries as with higher education the government\u2019s policies on further education take us in the wrong direction on participation and social mobility we are mindful of the impact that the trebling of fees is having on students and would-be students so this time last year we suggested an alternative to the government we have called on them to cut the tuition fee cap to a third to a maximum of \u00a36 000 we have proposed a fully funded way of doing that paid for by not going ahead with the corporation tax cut for the banks and through some additional payments by the wealthiest graduates ", "the corporation tax cut is for banks across the uk ", "no i will not because i must wrap up under our alternative package the top 10% of earners those with average incomes of \u00a365 000 or more over their working lives would pay more but research from the house of commons library has shown that all other income groups would be better off under this package universities would receive funding to compensate them for the loss of income from lower fees and the package would be revenue-neutral the important point is that the headline level of debt carried by students would be significantly lower and would avoid the harm to families and graduates that would be caused by the government\u2019s plans tonight\u2019s vote is the last opportunity before the new academic term begins for this house to force the government to change course on their trebling of tuition fees and to give hope to future generations of students that we as a house are prepared to prioritise them and their future that we will not abandon them that we understand that we need to provide them with ladders of opportunity not kick them away and that we will do whatever we can to help them fulfil their aspirations if they are allowed to succeed we as a country will succeed and i commend this motion to the house ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation and skills how many businesses in (a) birmingham

the hon member for east hampshire (damian hinds) and my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles (hazel blears) on securing the debate and on their excellent introduction which helped to set it in a wide context i pay tribute to the work of the all-party group on social mobility and its excellent report  7 key truths about social mobility which has done much to inform the debate both in parliament and beyond the debate has been excellent and wide-ranging with passionate speeches on both sides the hon member for east hampshire set as i said a strong context for the debate and made the point that at each stage of the education and employment spectrum it is normal to blame the previous stages for social mobility problems i can relate to that i am sure that the minister can too because in my conversations about university admissions with vice-chancellors they often say with some justification that what counts is what goes on before rather than just what happens when they get involved my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles made a powerful speech in which she touched on the importance of personal skills confidence resilience and emotional well-being which i will deal with towards the end of my speech that is a much under-discussed part of the wider debate i am also glad that she was able to get back to the firm that so cruelly rejected her given that she went on to become a secretary of state that is a great example of social justice in action the hon member for wyre forest (mark garnier) made a plea for financial education which i endorse although i must confess that i am not sure that i could do the sums he set out in his speech without the aid of a calculator given the looks on the faces of some of the other hon members present i am not sure they could either i welcome the involvement of my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch (meg hillier) in the all-party group many of the issues that afflict her constituency also afflict mine she is right that poverty should not mean a poverty of ambition and we should all take that point forward the hon member for rugby (mark pawsey) spoke powerfully about support for troubled families he also spoke about grammar schools and in birmingham we also still have a grammar school system i failed the 11-plus which is a badge i wear with great pride he made the important point that university is not the only route to social mobility and we should celebrate other routes and life choices my hon friend the member for ealing southall (mr sharma) reflected powerfully on his own experiences as someone not born in this country i was struck by what the hon member for thurrock (jackie doyle-price) told us about her parents saying when she was younger that they wanted her life to be better than theirs that is a key point for all parliamentarians and one reason why we get into this work is our desire to see the current generation do better than the one before it my hon friend the member for luton north (kelvin hopkins) spoke about the cultural change needed to get across to young people that their horizons are and canbe much wider than they might think might be told or might realise he made the important link something discussed in the all-party group report between social mobility and teaching standards the hon member for edinburgh west (mike crockart) confessed to having given unpaid internships in his office i am glad he has moved towards paid ones which raises the wider point of what we as members of the house of commons can do to promote internships going to people from a wider range of social backgrounds finally the hon member for cleethorpes (martin vickers) reflected that the individual life stories of the members who have spoken today have informed the debate and brought to life the issues that we are considering that is important particularly so with social mobility above almost any other topic because as parliamentarians we bring our life experience to what we debate i have a slight temptation to focus my remarks only on the relationship between higher education and social mobility given that both the minister and i have a education brief i will do my best however to resist that temptation and to focus on some of the wider points as well in government labour did a lot to begin to fracture the link between people\u2019s history and their destiny our policies focused on extending the ladders of opportunity especially through the sure start programme and the right to free early-years education which is important because we know as the all-party group confirms that the point of greatest leverage for social mobility is what happens between birth and the age of three we dramatically increased support for schools with disadvantaged pupils so the gaps in attainment between those from more and less advantaged backgrounds started to narrow a recent university of bristol study showed that family background had less influence on the results of those who took gcses in 2006 than it did on those who took the equivalent exams in 1986 the education maintenance allowance also dramatically increased participation rates post-16 and all of that sat alongside the expansion of higher education and the cementing of a widening participation agenda which helped to make real gains in social mobility we made progress but certainly not enough and there is a long way to go i am concerned that the cumulative effect of some of the government\u2019s current policies in education and higher education will set us on a backwards trend with long-lasting and damaging consequences for social mobility when the minister responds i will be grateful if he can tell us more about what the government are doing to ensure that that is not the case in relation to four specific areas of policy first in my experience my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch made the same point the removal of the ema remains the biggest issue for young people in my constituency directly affecting their ability to participate in education post-16 ", "i thank my right hon friend for that intervention she is absolutely right and her constituency experience accords exactly with my own young people in my constituency use the ema to pay for their travel to be able physically to get to their place of learning and books i was really struck by the speech of my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch when she said that somebody used it to pay for their electricity key which shows the different ways that the allowance was used and how damaging it is that it has now been lost we will continue to press the government on the impact on participation rates of the removal of ema we have already touched on the second policy area that is unsurprising given the higher education element of my role which is the trebling of tuition fees although almost all the attention is focused on 18-year-old would-be graduates one of my biggest concerns is the impact on mature students taking first degrees the number of those applications is down 11 9% mature students making the decision to improve their life chances by going to university were largely responsible for the gains that were made in widening participation in higher education and they are one of the main reasons why we got so close to the 50% target set by the previous labour government for participation in higher education the important point that was raised in the debate today as well as in the all-party group\u2019s report is that our social mobility story should not end at 18 what happens later is important too and the ability of mature students to go back into university is an important part of that ", "my hon friend is right there is the drop-off and then the difficult decision to get back in is really important we have seen the government axe the aimhigher scheme that was designed to widen participation in higher education i am concerned that the national scholarship programme will not be an adequate replacement for it in money terms and that it also disadvantages universities that recruit a large number of students from backgrounds in which we want to widen participation the programme is also based only on data in relation to free school meals which misses out those who come from further education colleges and also mature studentsfinally let me turn to the changes in the provision of information advice and guidance high-quality and accessible information advice and guidance is crucialfor ensuring that all young people know of the opportunities that are open to them providing the right support can make the difference to young people in determining their future pathway proper information advice and guidance should not be exclusively available to young people from better-off backgrounds the government must ask themselves whether the changes that they have introduced will ensure that proper advice and guidance is there for the many and not just the few there will be a gap in provision this summer as the funding for connexions has finished but the replacement for schools will not be coming online until september ", "i am not going to make tax policy on the hoof but i would like to get to a position where independent and private schools are redundant because the same sort of education and quality of education is available in the state sector to finish my point about information advice and guidance there is real concern that good advice will not go to the most disadvantaged and those who need it most much of the work will now be done online but we must recognise the importance not just of innovative high-quality and low-cost solutions but the face-to-face element in the provision of advice and guidance i endorse what my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles said about the government being able to learn more from organisations such as future first and schools throughout the country that are drawing on alumni to inspire and raise their pupils\u2019 aspirations as i said at the beginning of my speech i will not focus only on the brief that i shadow because the debate is much wider social mobility is not just about changing the odds of young people from poor backgrounds making it to university we must improve opportunities for those who do not make it to university we must get away from the thinking that there is only one kind of success or only one pathway to success and that everything else is a failure of some kind one of the biggest problems in our society is our collective and automatic assumption that if something is different it must be either better or worse that holds us back and the way in which we perpetuate class in our country is unnecessary baggage and very depressing i would like to get rid of that and two things jump out at me in relation to it the value that we give to vocational education and entrepreneurship first vocational study should never be treated as a second-class option the government have a role to play in bringing that about but the attitude of society as a whole is as important i cannot help but be jealous of the position in germany where middle-class parents boast about their kids doing great apprenticeships we should do more to get to a place where vocational education is just as much a gold standard as academic education we must make sure that there are good opportunities to switch between the two secondly entrepreneurship has an important role to play in increasing and improving social mobility my boss the shadow secretary of state for business innovation and skills recently made a speech about the link between entrepreneurship and social mobility he told a powerful story of his father who came to this country from nigeria in the 1960s and set up his own business that gave his father opportunities that were denied to him elsewhere it is clear that entrepreneurship has more of a role to play i am pleased to see an increasing number of universities focusing on enterprise opportunities for their graduates and undergraduates but we should guard against the  graduatisation of entrepreneurship it should remain an opportunity that is open to all in our society i want to pick up on the importance of the points made by my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles about skills around confidence emotional well-being and personal resilience the so-called public school confidence skills by reflecting on my experience as hon members can see i am an asian woman i am also a practising and observant muslim that is an important part of my identity and how i choose to live my life i was born and raised in small heath in birmingham which is a very diverse city where many people who look like me live in small heath particularly many people are like me and believe in the same god as i do the local school i went to had lots of people like me i went to a different school to do a-levels and it was more mixed but there were still plenty of people like me nothing in my previous life experience had prepared me for my first night as a law undergraduate at oxford where i was the only non-white face in the junior common room i was certainly the only muslim woman in the whole college which had an undergraduate body of 300 for someone to enter a room and find that they are the only one of their kind is a weird experience even if they are self-confident as i am apart from being weird i also found it intimidating it took me a solid month before i could enter any room in my college such as the jcr or the hall for meals without taking a deep breath and saying a silent prayer when i was qualifying to be a barrister i experienced the same thing on my first day as a pupil barrister in chambers although this time it did not take me a month to normalise to being the only one of my kind it took me only a couple of weeks which was a good downward trajectory because by the time i got to parliament it meant that i was not afraid in fact it had become a depressingly normal part of my existence i raise that point because while i was at university i was involved in the oxford access scheme when i graduated i taught as a volunteer at a supplementary school i have done lots of mentoring of young people from my kind of background my race background my religious background and my socio-economic background and the one thing that i always try to focus them on is not how to do the interview or the application but a sense of self-confidence by which i mean not just innate confidence in themselves whichthey might have anyway but the skill of faking confidence when they do not feel it that is incredibly important the techniques include taking a deep breath before entering a room and looking people in the eye they also need to be physically robust in order to make their presence felt and to not be intimidated what we call soft skills are not soft at all if people do not have them they are hard it is difficult for people to take such things on board if they have not been a part of their previous experience i would like us to think more deeply about what more we can do to bring those things about in conclusion it is clear that we have to intensify and broaden our approach to social mobility in the future not just because social justice demands it but because our capacity for economic growth requires it ", "to ask the secretary of state for education how much funding he has allocated to sure

first double dip for 37 years that long-term unemployment is at its highest since 1996 and that 1 million young people are out of work it is shocking that the queen\u2019sspeech contains no measures to deal with those problems and therefore utterly fails to address the crisis that millions face i wish to focus my remarks on unemployment and in particular on youth unemployment and the government\u2019s failure to understand that there is an unemployment emergency in our country we have had a budget and a queen\u2019s speech that have failed to deliver on jobs and desperately needed economic growth not only is that complacent the government do not seem to understand that every day they waste in failing to take comprehensive action to get our economy moving again and our people into work represents a tragic waste of talent aspiration and confidence for more and more of our citizens my constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the country at 21 6% and youth unemployment is at 11 2% that is 2 200 young people looking for work from march last year to march this year there was an 84% increase in the number of young jobseeker\u2019s allowance claimants out of work for more than six months and a shocking 91% increase in the number of unemployed young people out of work for one year or longer youth unemployment alone is set to cost birmingham as a city \u00a3400 million in the coming decade behind each statistic is a young person bruised and battered by their experiences of job hunting under this government and terrified that they will be part of the lost generation they tell me that they have worked hard overcoming difficult social and family circumstances to get qualifications only to find that none of it matters it is depressingly normal for young people in my constituency to tell me that they might as well not have bothered that their effort has been wasted and that they do not know where to turn a climate of fear is already brewing among young people still at school who despair that their chances of getting on have been kicked away by the cuts to education maintenance allowance and the trebling of tuition fees they watch their older siblings getting into debt and sending off cv after cv with no luck and no hope and fear that they will end up in the same boat yet the government do nothing but create more damage they cut the future jobs fund which was making a real difference in my constituency as soon as they came into office saying that at \u00a36 500 per job created it was simply too expensive last week the national audit office told us that the government\u2019s flagship regional growth fund will create 41 000 jobs not the 500 000 that the government originally claimed the nao also said that most of these jobs would have been created in any event and that each of them will cost us \u00a333 000 with a cost in some cases of as much as \u00a3106 000 per net additional job so the government got rid of something that was making a real difference saying that it was too expensive and brought in something that is even more expensive but is not making the difference they said it would that proves that they are not only out of touch and complacent but incompetent unlike labour\u2019s proposal for a real jobs guarantee the government\u2019s youth contract does not guarantee a job it is merely a subsidy to an employer who is hiring a young person which covers only half their wages and does not create a new job labour\u2019s plan for a real jobs guarantee would go much further guaranteeing a job after 12 months of unemployment and covering the full wages for the employer in failing to deal with youth unemployment the government are storing up problems for the future because if we allow the young unemployed of today to become a lost generation they will be the long-term workless of tomorrow as i have seen in my own constituency which already suffers from long-term worklessness getting back into work people who have been out of work for significant periods or who have never been in work is a significant challenge that costs huge sums problems that have been a generation in the making will take at least that long to fix so it is far better on every measure to stop us getting to that point in the first place the young unemployed in my constituency and across our country were looking for a change of course and a sense of hope but i am afraid that in this queen\u2019s speech there is neither change nor hope just a confirmation that this government do not listen do not care and do not have a clue ", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions how many people in birmingham ladywood constituency took out loans using the social fund in each of the last five years ", "to

themselves at a time when the economy is flatlining families are being squeezed and students are facing the tripling of tuition fees the news that ministers approved the contract of a senior official

he ask about the tax and national insurance implications of employing mr lester on this basis did hmrc approve the arrangement after mr lester was appointed chief executive on a permanent basis or only when he was the interim chief executive does the chief secretary know how much tax and national insurance has been avoided by these arrangements has he now withdrawn his approval of mr lester\u2019s contract and is it being redrawn how many other senior appointments have the government made on these terms surely the right hon gentleman will know how many he has signed off if he does not know is it not time that he started asking questions of his colleagues and defending the interests of taxpayers the government\u2019s handling of higher education has been disastrous this week we have heard that their tripling of fees and botched reforms have cut applications to university and before christmas the public accounts committee criticised hmrc for its cosy relationship with big

opposition to what has been an excellent debate i congratulate my hon friend the member for huddersfield (mr sheerman) on securing this important and timely debate he delivered his speech with passion and conviction and he has a deep commitment to this area of policy indeed he bought additional expertise to the debate given his involvement in the higher education commission which is currently conducting an inquiry into postgraduate education i am sure that all members of the house look forward to the commission\u2019s report which will be produced once that inquiry is complete however having congratulated my hon friend on securing the debate i must also congratulate my hon friend the member for city of durham (roberta blackman-woods) who initiated the form-filling that helped to secure the debate my hon friend the member for huddersfield spoke very powerfully about the importance of postgraduate education and the fact that it has been somewhat isolated in the context of the current debate about university education he also made the important point that higher education should be looked at holistically and he is absolutely right about that in addition he spoke about the impact that the presence of a university has on the city and region in which it is located and i too can relate to the experience of having a university in my constituency given that aston university is in my constituency and both birmingham university and birmingham city university are just outside my constituency boundary my hon friend spoke at length about postgraduate research which i will discuss later we also had excellent contributions from the other members who spoke my hon friend the member for sheffield central (paul blomfield) addressed the issues in relation to taught postgraduate courses he spoke powerfully about issues of access and the effect that widening participation in education can have especially in improving access to the professions having been a barrister before i became an mp i can absolutely attest to the fact that the professions often feel like middle-class enclaves and when someone is from an immigrant working-class background as i am that is an entirely different kind of world my hon friend the member for city of durham spoke about the role of postgraduate education in strengthening both the academic community as a whole and international research teams which is a very important point she also talked about how that speaks to both our role and our reputation in the world we havealways punched above our weight and we should treasure that my hon friend returned to the important challenge of funding which i will address later and my hon friend the member for luton south (gavin shuker) rightly praised the role of modern universities we are very lucky in this country to have a diverse higher education ecosystem and we should cherish that diversity of mission intake and teaching and research strengths this has been an important constructive and necessary debate members have already made the point that discussion of higher education in parliament often focuses on undergraduates especially on an 18-year-old undergraduate\u2019s journey through the system that is of course extremely important but it sometimes prevents both recognition of the importance of part-time and mature students at undergraduate level and adequate discourse about postgraduate education as a whole which is deeply unsatisfactory quite apart from the fact that postgraduate education generates something like \u00a31 5 billion in output we must as other members have said take a holistic view of the sector if the policies we then formulate are to encourage quality competitiveness growth and social mobility we very much welcome any expansion of postgraduate education especially that which took place between 2005 and 2010 as it clearly has benefits for the individual and for society as a whole taught postgraduate degrees particularly when accessed by mature students can help an individual improve their career prospects or change career entirely especially with part-time study given the tough economic climate we face coupled with the sheer terror of potential unemployment and what that does to life chances particularly those of young people students taking up postgraduate education immediately on completion of undergraduate courses do so increasingly because of the growing belief that we need more than one degree to be competitive however postgraduate education is accessed and for whatever reasons taught postgraduate education creates an increase in the national skills base and in earning capacity and in that way benefits the economy and growth also essential to innovation and economic growth is research-based postgraduate education through which we have the best chance of stimulating the kind of innovation we need to effect the rebalancing of our economy and get back to long-term growth and we believe that the government can and should play an active role in that the uk\u2019s delivery of global research output is second only to that of the united states which demonstrates the health of our sector and the fact that as i said earlier we punch above our weight in the world but with increasing competition from across the globe the government must ensure that we keep pace with our competitor countries my hon friend the member for sheffield central made an important point about the ageing demographic make-up of the research community and such issues highlight the need for the government to bring forward a strategy that maintains the strength and diversity of our research base especially given the reliance in some parts of the sector on international students welcome though their contribution is one of the biggest areas of concern as we have heard today is funding funding concerns have been amplified by the government\u2019s decision to treble undergraduate tuition fees to \u00a39 000 we are concerned not only aboutthe impact that that will have on access to and participation in undergraduate education but about what higher levels of undergraduate debt will mean for postgraduate education with cuts in the teaching grant and higher fees the debt burden gets ever higher and so too does the prospect that students from deprived backgrounds who are more likely to be debt-averse and mature students with family commitments will be locked out of postgraduate education thereby cementing the dominance of the middle classes particularly telling is the situation of those who would have become mature students but are deciding not to bother with postgraduate education because of the higher fees and the associated debt burden their aspirations are being blocked because they have come to the view that financially it simply is not worth the risk that will also have an impact on social mobility especially when we consider as other members have said that postgraduate education is an important route into professions such as law and the civil service which are rightly and regularly criticised for the lack of diversity among their intake that scenario will only get further entrenched in the present situation it is in that context that we have argued that the government should have changed course to bring the cap on undergraduate tuition fees down to \u00a36 000 a measure paid for by not going ahead with a corporation tax cut for the banks and by asking the top 10% of graduates to pay a bit more ", "the important point is about the headline level of debt which i was coming on to make our proposal takes into account and does not change the government\u2019s decisions on the overall budgets it clearly shows that it was still possible for them to do more to bring down the headline level of undergraduate fees by one third thereby reducing the overall debt burden which in turn would have had less impact on the numbers of people going into postgraduate education we welcome the attention being given to future funding options for postgraduate education by various bodies such as the higher education commission i also note the report by centreforum and its proposal for a \u00a310 000 state-backed loan scheme for people taking one-year taught postgraduate courses and that the national union of students and others are considering possible packages we welcome the work being done to develop models for the sustainable funding of postgraduate education and while alternative models are being developed and their viability assessed the government can and should consider what more they can do to encourage the availability of professional career development loans and to ensure that they work with banks to get the best possible deal for postgraduate students the government\u2019s white paper on higher education unfortunately barely mentioned postgraduate education it certainly did not create any legislative space for the discussion of issues affecting postgraduate education or of how those issues might be dealt with that was a mistake and a missed opportunity i note that the minister reconvened the smith review last year and that additional work will now be done by the higher education funding council for england so perhapsthe minister will take the opportunity today to update us on that funding consultation exercise being undertaken by hefce and the participation review it is clear from the contributions to this debate and from the concerns highlighted by the higher education sector that a comprehensive strategy for postgraduate education is needed we have as other members have mentioned heard rumours in the past couple of days that the government have u-turned on their policy of expanding the presence of for-profit providers in higher education and so will not now introduce their planned higher education bill this summer the minister might therefore have a bit more time on his hands and could have even more if he heeded our call not to make any further changes to the core and margin model in 2013-14 allowing the sector to enjoy a year of stability i wonder if the minister might take this opportunity to redirect his energies into preparing the comprehensive postgraduate education strategy that is being called for by so many ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation

else if that debate helps to shed some light on what is going on in another part of the world ", "will my hon friend give way ", "i am grateful to be called to contribute to this important debate and i congratulate the hon members for wycombe (steve baker) and for ilford north (mr scott) on securing it i am pleased that it has proved so popular with parliamentary colleagues although the unfortunate flip-side is that we have a strict time limit on our contributions like the hon member for wycombe i wish to focus my comments on the situation in kashmir this topic is important to me because my constituency and birmingham as a whole has a large british-kashmiri population some of whose members are here for the debate and many of whom have written to me asking me to voice their concerns in the house the subject is also important to me personally because i am of kashmiri origin my family originated from the mirpur district of pakistani-administered kashmir both my parents were born there and i still have family and friends there consequently the plight of kashmiris and the necessity of finding a peaceful resolution to the kashmir dispute have loomed large in my life for too long the beautiful region of kashmir often described as paradise on earth has been caught in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous conflicts but it is a conflict that is little reported and often does not get the media and global political attention that it needs and deserves i am grateful therefore that this debate has given us an opportunity to focus on the issue i know too that many british kashmiris are grateful to the all-party group on kashmir and sultan mehmood chaudhry a former prime minister of azad kashmir for their efforts to raise the profile of this dispute and to secure political debate and action the failure to resolve the kashmir dispute and particularly the failure to give effect to un resolutions from the 1940s urging a plebiscite in kashmir so that the kashmiri people can determine their own future has resulted in an uprising in indian-administered kashmir the suppression of which according to amnesty international\u2019s  lawless law report has led to grave human rights violations the report highlights disturbing and unacceptable cases of abuse with the application of the jammu and kashmir public safety act 1978 in particular undermining efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution amnesty international found that many cases in which the public safety act had been applied involved length periods of illegal detention of political activists seeking kashmiri independence in violation of indian national law as well as international law many cases featured allegations of torture and other forms of ill treatment being used to coerce people into making confessions one of the most offensive features of the public safety act is that it provides for immunity from prosecution for officials operating under it thereby granting impunity for human rights violations under the law the application of the act together with the discovery of mass graves in kashmir the mumbai attacks in 2008 and kashmir\u2019s bloody summer of 2010 have undermined the prospects for a resolution of the dispute ", "i am grateful to my hon friend for her intervention and i endorse her contribution i know that she too is a passionate advocate of human rights on the indian subcontinent a resolution is needed desperately and urgently the world and especially the people of kashmir cannot afford for india and pakistan to be engaged in perpetual dispute over the region the human cost is too great the partition of the two countries in 1947 resulted in hundreds of thousands dead in the three wars that have been fought between the two states more than 15 000 people have died and the estimates of the number of dead following the uprisings in kashmir range from 40 000 to 100 000 both countries spend too much of their budgets on defence that money should be channelled into eradicating poverty and promoting health education and human rights india and pakistan have both acquired nuclear weapons and the fear that the hostility between the two countries which springs from a mix of religion history and territory might change quickly into armed conflict is very real and never too far away meanwhile the people of kashmir continue to suffer so a resolution of the dispute deserves and demands our attention and talks must be pursued with vigour on all sides ", "i endorse the hon gentleman\u2019s comments as i have said i am grateful that we are having this debate today i said that all sides needed to pursue a solution with vigour because too often the rest of the world sees only india and pakistan as the main contestants in the dispute it is my contention however that the kashmiri people themselves are the central party and should be treated as such as it is their future that is at the heart of the dispute i also think that the british government have a vital role to play not only because of our history but because our country is home to large diaspora communities from india pakistan and kashmir we therefore have a unique insight into the intricacies of the dispute and an important role to play in achieving its resolution we should be a critical friend to both india and pakistan and a strong advocate of the rights of kashmiris they are a strong resilient proud generous and passionate people and their land is a place of great natural beauty and potential their plight demands our attention and they deserve our efforts to bring the injustice that they have suffered to an end ", "to ask the secretary of state for health how many foreign nationals owe (a) under \u00a31 000 and (b) over \u00a31 000 for nhs treatment which

brief i endorse the powerful contribution made by my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles (hazel blears) she spoke with great passion about an issue that has concerned her for some time it certainly concerned her in committee and it has concerned opposition front benchers too relocation has been a central issue in the debates that we have had about the bill both on second reading and in committee and it is one of the most important issues that we are taking forward on report new clause 1 seeks to add the power of relocation to the bill to replicate the position in relation to control orders under the prevention of terrorism act 2005 it is clear from the evidence that the relocation power has proved extremely useful in disrupting terrorist activity it is regularly described by police and others as one of the most useful and effective powers that they have under the control orders regime we know that nine of the 12 current control orders have relocation as part of the control order the importance of relocation as a measure to be made available to the police in meeting the terror threat was made clear at the evidence sessions held by the public bill committee we heard evidence from deputy assistant commissioner stuart osborne for whom like my right hon friend said i am starting to feel slightly sorry she quoted him but i will repeat the important bit of the quote again because it will concentrate the mind of the house the relocation issue has been very useful for us being able to monitor and enforce at the current time without that relocation and depending on where people choose to live that could be significantly more difficult he added the new freedoms that will be given to individuals will significantly increase the challenges that we have to face and managing those challenges will increase the resources that we need the degree to which we are successful in managing them depends on both the extent of the bill and the additional resources that we get \u2013\u2013[official report terrorism prevention and investigation measures public bill committee 21 june 2011 c 5-6 qs 10 and 14 ]the importance of relocation as a measure was further highlighted by lord howard and lord carlile lord howard the former home secretary has described the power as the single most useful power in ensuring that the package of measures that we have is sufficient to keep us safe it is clear from the evidence that the police gave to the committee that the additional risk created by removing relocation from the tpims regime could be mitigated by the additional resources but it would not be eliminated and there are of course degrees of mitigation in committee dac osborne was only  hopeful that the risk would not increase if the bill were passed which does not fill me with a huge amount of confidence it is clear and we must recognise that there is an irreducible minimum number of people who pose a serious threat to our country and we have to have an adequate and effective way to manage that risk relocation is clearly an important part of that package of measures it is our view that if the new clause is added to the bill the policing challenge that dac osborne and others will face will be reduced and our collective security protected it has always been our concern that if this bill closes off the power of relocation to the home secretary if it deprives her of being able to use that power that would deprive her of an incredibly important tool in her kit bag for dealing with the threat posed by a very small number of people for those reasons we will support new clause 1 in the division ", "i am conscious of the time and the fact that we have to get on to new clause 1 on relocation ahead of third reading so i will try to keep my remarks reasonably brief i endorse the remarks of my right hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east (paul goggins) about the draft bill he spoke having been a member of the committee that considered the draft detention of terrorist suspects (temporary extensions) bill the findings of which are important and directly relevant to the draft emergency legislation that the government printed a few days ago as he pointed out although that committee understood the government\u2019s reasons for proposing that contingency powers to extend the maximum period for pre-charge detention should be provided in primary legislation so that they could be subject to parliamentary scrutiny it still found a number of problems those problems exist also in relation to the draft enhanced tpims bill and it is important that we take a moment to remind ourselves of what the objections were the first objection was in relation to parliamentary scrutiny of a draft bill as primary legislation the debate that would take place would be so circumscribed by the difficulties of explaining the reasons for introducing primary legislation that it would not be possible for the house to be given proper reasons why we needed to proceed along that route in relation to the 28-day detention powers the risk was that a court case might be prejudiced in this case the objection is even more important because we are talking about intelligence evidence that has been gathered by the security services which of course cannot be discussed openly that is the whole reason why we have closed sessions of courts to consider such matters they cannot enter into the public domain that rather defeats the purpose of having any debate on the floor of the house the second objection was that there would be an unacceptable degree of risk that it would be impossible to introduce and pass the legislation quickly when parliament was in recess although that objection referred to the 28-day detention power it is also important in this case counter-terror investigations are fast-moving and it is not acceptable to say to the police that their reaction to investigations should be hampered while parliament debates the matter perhaps in a limited way and decides to pass an act that would not be an acceptable way to proceed the third objection related to the period when parliament has been dissolved but as we can see that is precisely what new clauses 5 and 6 are intended to address i say to the minister that it is clear from the draft bill that the government have no principled objection to the control order powers that would suddenly be available once again as my right hon friend the member for wolverhampton south east (mr mcfadden) said the draft bill is an insurance policy that the government are taking out on their tpims regime which will decrease and weaken the powers available to the police and the home secretary to control the behaviour of terror suspects it is extremely unacceptable for legislation to be conducted in such a way control order powers are either needed or they are not this bill has used up many hours of parliamentary time to take us round in a circle and bring us back to exactly where we started with control orders rather than introduce this confused and fudged bill which raises many more questions the government should have been honest and admitted that sometimes stringent control order measures such as relocation and 16-hour curfews are necessary they should therefore have put them in the bill that we are debating today i am afraid that the  argument on context that there is a standard context that would require only the standard tpim and an emergency context in which the enhanced tpim might be required does not hold up to any kind of scrutiny because control orders and tpims if they are introduced are at the emergency end of what we do they are not brought in lightly and have always been emergency measures i was disappointed that the minister chose to describe control orders and indeed tpims as  business as usual that was a disappointing way of characterising them it was lazy and potentially dangerous because it implies that it is par for the course to apply such measures and that that happens in the normal run of things control orders never happened in the normal run of things they were and always have been exceptional tpims will also be exceptional so saying that they are an exceptional version of something that is already exceptional or for use in an  emergency emergency simply will not work the minister should be up front with the house and the public on that point the framework in which we expect our police and security services to operate is also important in our discussion on sunset clauses the minister spoke of the importance of a settled position so that the police can plan but the provisions are creating a more unsettled position which prompts the question of how the police can plan for the terrorist risk that we face we should have a more settled framework but the draft legislation does not bring that about it raises many more questions when replying to the debate i ask the minister to turn his mind to the specifics of when those powers will be used in particular would the circumstances of the case of cd trigger the passing of the draft bill that individual was relocated because he needed to be removed from london where he was trying to gather weapons and engage in a mumbai-style attack would that be an emergency situation in which the home secretary would choose to trigger the draft bill the hon member for cambridge (dr huppert) asked whether the mere fact that we are having the olympics next year would be enough to trigger the draft bill what if resources are stretched what if the impact ofthe cuts is too great for the police even given the additional resources that will be available to them under the tpims regime would that be classed as an emergency that requires the passing of the draft bill we need clear answers from the minister on how that will work without them the house will be expected to legislate in the dark which is an unacceptable way for us to proceed the opposition do not want the secretary of state to be in a position in which she does not have the powers she needs to cope with an emergency when parliament is dissolved so we will not oppose government new clauses 5 or 6 however we have grave concerns about how the government are proceeding with their draft legislation they are exposing the fiction that has been at the heart of the control orders debate which is based more on a political fudge than on an assessment of the security needs of the country we need clearer answers from the government on that point ", "i thank the minister for giving way and for the indication that further written evidence will be available i am still minded to press amendment 20 to a vote later this evening but i have been advised by the clerks that if new clause 3 is passed we cannot have a vote on new clause 7 may i clarify that although we would have liked to vote on annual renewal we still believe it is an important measure we will not oppose new clause 3 however labour members will take the issue forward when the bill reaches the other place ", "how does the minister say that control orders or tpims are business as usual ", "or downwards ", "does the hon gentleman recognise that the amendments as drafted envisage that the tpims regime will come into force and that they seek only to delay it until the resources are ready they do not seek to keep control orders for ever more ", "i entirely endorse my right hon friend\u2019s comments the house needs much more detail given that there now seems to be a big difference between what deputy assistant commissioner osborne told us in committee and what the minister is telling the house today a written explanation needs to be put before the house when we are working out whether we buy this new line that the resources will in fact be ready if that information is forthcoming it is important that it should be about not just the human resources but the hardware software and other assets as well as the money iappreciate that some of that information might be constrained but surely it would not be too difficult to allay any fears that the house might have about the time that it takes for such resources to be either trained up or procured and developed ", "the short answer is yes we have retained the control order regime until the end of this year which was a decision that the coalition government took to give themselves a chance to bring forward their legislation i do not think that an amendment that seeks to make that legislation better or at least allay concerns that the public might have about the dangers that it poses should somehow mean that we dump control orders and just have a gap we could quite easily carry on with control orders until the new resources were ready to be deployed which is exactly what the amendment envisages ", "in that case i hope that the hon gentleman will support amendment 20 he has made my case for me ", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for giving me that indication i am also grateful for his support he was of course a fellow member of the public bill committee ", "i entirely endorse my right hon friend\u2019s point which reminds me that under the bill access to electronic communications must be provided to suspects one of the justifications for that is that the suspects will be monitored in that way and the equipment will be provided by the home office presumably some kind of software or hardware wiring will be needed to enable the suspects to be traced and to listen in on conversations again i do not believe that those technical assets could be procured overnight especially given the different kinds of asset that might be needed to deal with different kinds of risk ", "i entirely disagree with the hon gentleman in fact he almost makes my point for me the police do an incredible job of trying to protect us from the serious risks that we face not only from the individuals who are or have been subjected to a control order but from the many hundreds possibly thousands more who are of interest to them in their investigations into potential terrorism offences the risk is always there which is why we had to bring in the control order regime and why we believe those powers are necessary elements of the bill decrease those measures in such a way as to increase the risk we are told that the risk can be mitigated by the additional resources but it cannot be eliminated we have a real fear that those additional resources will not be ready by the time the bill comes into force for that reason amendment 20 would reassure the public its purpose is really no more than that ", "no i am about to finish my speech i note that the government have made some movement in the right direction in relation to the review and the sunset clause but i do not believe that that goes far enough we need the extra check and balance that would be provided by annual renewal so i am minded to press new clause 7 to a vote and unless the minister gives us further reassurance about the resources i shall also be minded to press amendment 20 to the vote ", "i am going to make some progress i have been quite generous and i will take some more interventions a little later on annual renewal covered in new clause 7 there is a symbolic and practical importance to parliament asking itself every year whether the powers that it has given the home secretary are still necessary and in holding the police and the government to account for how those powers are used that is an important measure of checks and balances as we discussed in committee it also concentrates the mind it requires the police and everybody else to consider regularly whether we truly need these powers whether the risk is such that we cannot do without them and whether some mechanism might present itself that would enable more people to be brought within the criminal justice system rather than be kept outside it our debate in committee featured the idea of exceptionalism the idea that these powers are an exceptional part of our legal framework and should not be permanent of course the bill did not originally have the provisions of new clauses 3 and 4 in it and i am grateful that the government have made some movement and taken on board some of the argumentsmade in committee in support of more regular review and renewal of the powers however i do not believe that the new clauses go far enough or that review every five years would meet our concerns about how the bill and the new tpims regime will operate in practice there are a number of reasons for our concerns the first which the minister touched on is about resources we have real concern about the additional resources that the police have said will be required under the new regime because there will be a higher risk under tpims we are concerned about how they will be deployed and come on line ready for the police to use given that uncertainty annual renewal and an early opportunity for parliament to consider how the new tpims regime is getting on would be very welcome it is necessary also because of the draft bill that the government printed only about four days ago as it would bring control order powers back into the system by way of emergency legislation we have a number of questions about how that alternative regime may operate which we will come to in the next group of amendments ", "a review is an opportunity for parliament to take stock of how the regime has operated over the course of one year and to decide whether it wants to give the home secretary those powers to use for another year obviously parliament is the right place to debate any new circumstances that bring about the need for more powers ", "i agree with my hon friend on the starting point for debate when parliament considers such matters it must consider the balance of risk and ask serious questions about how that risk is managed that should always be the starting point of hon members as responsible parliamentarians when we consider exceptional powers that do not exist in other parts of our legal framework we are also committed to saying that in an ideal world we would not need such powers but unfortunately we are not in an ideal world [ interruption ] does the right hon member for haltemprice and howden (mr davis) want to intervene ", "the right hon gentleman does not so i shall press on i spoke of the draft bill that the government published a few days ago which seeks to introduce control order powers by way of emergency legislation that bill which we will discuss at length shortly raises many questions and an early opportunity for parliament to take stock of the operation implementation practice and working of that regime will be welcome ", "the first part of the hon gentleman\u2019s intervention makes my point for me this is about the balance of risk it is in the interests of those who are under control orders for parliament to look at such measures at regular intervals rather than once every five years his intervention supports rather than goes against my point ", "i shall make some progress because i am about to wind-up on new clause 7 the minister spoke of the comments made by my right hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east (paul goggins) on second reading my right hon friend spoke powerfully on the merit of reaching a settled position on such measures but i should tell the minister that given what has happened in the past few days we are clearly not at a settled position on the bill in fact the government unsettled matters further by introducing the draft bill a few days ago for that reason the opposition believe that an annual renewal measure is merited and needed now more than ever and we shall later seek to press new clause 7 to a division i am grateful for the minister\u2019s comments on amendment 20 which is in my name and those of my right hon and hon friends he updated the house and told us from the dispatch box that the police say that they will be able to meet the increased risks that we face under tpims with the additional resources but i am afraid that i do not feel reassured by what he said and we need to consider the matter in greater detail in the house this evening by way of background i should add that amendment 20 began life in committee as the minister noted and was introduced following evidence given to the committee by deputy assistant commissioner osborne the national co-ordinator for counter-terrorist investigations it is important to consider his evidence in detail he was asked by my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles (hazel blears) about the time scales that hewas working to in relation to the tpims regime given that we have the olympics next year which is a particular concern he said to get the resources that we anticipate we need will take more than a year in terms of being able to get people trained and to get the right equipment until we have got that we will not be able to start to bed things in and see how it works and how it transpires it also depends on how many people actually go on to the tpims regime and how many people come off it there are a lot of inter-dependents there the control order put people in the protect and prepare part of the contest strategy tpims moves them back into the pursue element of the strategy which is a slight paradox because it was only due to the failure to get sufficient evidence to prosecute them that we moved them into the control order in the first placehe was asked further questions about resources by the hon and learned member for sleaford and north hykeham (stephen phillips) he asked why mr osborne was saying that it would take a year for the new regime to bed in to which mr osborne replied i think i said it would take a year to procure and train sufficient additional assets before it would be ready to do that we have to order some of the assets so that they are made in advance to train a surveillance officer and then have them fully able to operate in a challenging environment probably takes at least 12 months before they are deployable once they are deployable they have to work within the environment under a new set of regimes that will need to bed in \u2013\u2013[official report terrorism prevention and investigation measures public bill committee 21 june 2011 c 9-10 ]that important evidence is the reason i moved the amendment in committee and why i tabled amendment 20 for debate today i was extremely concerned about the position on resources the evidence from mr osborne was obviously stark and it raised in my mind the spectre that if the bill were passed by the end of this year as we anticipate it will be we would create a concerning situation the additional resources required to meet the increased risk might not be deployable and if they are it seems they might be only partially ready that is not to my mind a satisfactory state of affairs the amendment therefore seeks to prevent the bill from coming into force until the resources are online and would put in place a mechanism by which to get agreement between the national co-ordinator and the home secretary on the additional resources required and to get them ready and online ", "i am grateful to my hon friend for his intervention i entirely agree that the additional costs of the tpims regime are of concern given the much lower cost of the control order regime and i invite the minister to explain how that correlates with the draft emergency legislation presumably the additional resources might not be required in those circumstances we need greater clarity about the costs that might arise in that situation when i asked the minister in relation to amendment 20 about the one year that it takes to train up a surveillance officer he said  we\u2019re not just looking at human resources but it is clear that mr osborne this is why i read out his responses was not just talking about human resources either he was talking about hardware software and money resources too and it was his considered opinion put on the record of the house that all those resources would take more than one year to come online i have to say that the minister\u2019s explanation that not only are we looking at surveillance officers but somehow this process can be managed with technology as well as anything else does not give us the reassurance that we need that all the resources will be available a point that i put to the minister in committee as well i am not a very technical person i often describe myself as a  tech-know-nothing however after we have worked out what hardware is required it will then need to be designed procured and made a process that i imagine would also take some time and could not happen overnight again we do not have any clarity that those assets will be ready by the time the bill comes into force either we are in a position where parliament is being asked to pass a bill when there are real concerns about whether the increased risk that it poses can be met by the government and the police our amendments do not seek to frustrate the purpose of the bill but to reassure the house and perhaps more importantly the public that we will be ready for the new regime when it comes online they therefore offer a practical way to try to deal with some of the issues that have been raised in committee and which will be of great concern to the public i never thought that i would say this but i can pray in aid lord howard the former home secretary in support of my case for amendment 20 he too gave evidence to the committee saying if the police evidence is that it will take them a year to prepare that evidence has to be respected obviously it is important that arrangements remain in place until the moment arrives when the new regime can be effectively introduced \u2013\u2013[official report terrorism prevention and investigation measures public bill committee 21 june 2011 c 27 q84 ]that is exactly the purpose of amendment 20 ", "may i welcome the minister formally to his place it is a pleasure to continue on report the debate that we had in committee i shall speak to new clause 7 and amendment 20 which stand in my name and those of my right hon and hon friends i am grateful to the minister for his explanation of the government\u2019s movement in relation to the introduction of new clause 3 and new clause 4 which as he explained envisages a five-year sunset clause and moves us somewhat further on than did our debate in committee new clause 7 would replicate the position under the prevention of terrorism act 2005 which brought in the control order regime and the amendment would limit to 12 months the powers under the tpims regime and would therefore require their annual renewal by parliament our new clause began in committee as an amendment which i moved and was based on oral evidence given in committee by liberty justice and others it was introduced to reflect our concerns that the government\u2019s legislation will mean fewer checks and balances on what are exceptional measures many in the house agree that they are undesirable and in an ideal world we would not have to have them but they have proved necessary given the serious terrorist risks that we face i do not often agree with liberty particularly on control orders because our starting points for the debate are different but i was struck by its evidence in committee when the organisation made it clear that it would rather to be fair to shami chakrabarti she said that she would choke on these words take existing control orders with their annual renewal meaning a 12-month limit on their power over the new tpims regime the reasons why and why i agree with that position primarily relate to the importance of bringing such exceptional measures back to the house for regular annual review and if parliament deems it appropriate for renewal ", "i am grateful for that intervention and i will come to lord carlile\u2019s evidence in committee he clearly did not think that annual renewal was needed but recent developments in particular the introduction of the government\u2019s draft bill four days ago make annual renewal even more necessary than before i will turn shortly to the reasons why ", "i am afraid that i have to give the hon gentleman exactly the same answer that the minister gave which is that obviously one parliament cannot constrain another i imagine that most new governments would want to look carefully and responsibly at what are exceptional measures we have all stated on many occasions that in an ideal world we would not need these powers the risk is developing all the time and i would hope that any government would keep these matters under continual review rather than just saying that they will do it every five years i think that that clearly sets out our position ", "wherever possible we should clearly proceed down the criminal justice system route if that is available in the irreducible minimum number of cases that we have it should be pursued i expect the police and responsible prosecutors to ensure that prosecutions take place wherever possible i think that all members on both sides of the house share the view that it is far better that individuals involved in terrorism-related activity are prosecuted convicted and banged up however there are cases where it is not possible to convert the evidence that we have which is intelligence based into evidence that would be admissible in a court of law for those cases it is necessary to have a different system to deal with the risk if we could avoid being in that position of course we would but it is just not possible because of the nature of the evidence and the intelligence sources that it relies on i am afraid to say that it will not always be possible to resort to the criminal justice system and that a different kind of system for dealing with this risk is therefore necessary ", "i am surprised that the hon gentleman would describe parliamentary debate and holding the government to account as a fiction i do not think that having an annual debate is a fiction it is important that we give right hon and hon members the chance to hold the government to account to review how the powers have been used throughout a particular year and to take a view on whether the risk is such that we still need an exceptional system of rules outside the criminal justice system i do not believe that those debates are a fiction ", "i am grateful for the right hon gentleman\u2019s intervention in the end we must accept that there is an irreducible minimum number of cases in which the intelligence tells us that a serious risk is posed by an individual and they have to be dealt with but they cannot be brought within the criminal justice system we must accept that we need a system for mitigating that risk and for bringing those individuals under some form of control to prevent them from attack planning which might lead to the loss of innocent lives ", "i note that the hon gentleman\u2019s amendments on police bail did not make the selection list today so we cannot continue the debate on it that was begun in committee i simply repeat to him the position as it was stated in committee there may well be some cases in which it is possible to consider whether police bail might be an answer but i do not believe that that would be possible in the vast majority of cases that is not the view of the experts including the individuals who looked into the matter under the last labour government that was why the control orders regime was deemed necessary i also say to the hon gentleman that when an individual is put on police bail it is with a view to bringing a prosecution if that process were started in the knowledge that the intelligence could never be converted into evidence applying for police bail would be a sham i am not sure that many judges would let an individual get away with that ", "the minister will recall from committee that one of the issues regarding additional resources was the fact that we are talking not just about money but about the extra surveillance officers who will be required to meet the increased risk under the tpims regime which did not exist under control orders because we had relocation and longer curfews dac osborne was clear that ittakes about a year to train the extra surveillance officers will the minister explain how that will be truncated and how the training will now take less than a year ", "i am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to put before the house the experiences and the views of my constituents on what they have suffered over the past few days when the problems started in my constituency on monday night we saw copycat criminality mindless vandalism and looting this behaviour appalled and sickened everyone in my constituency and birmingham as a whole and on tuesday morning residents and traders woke up to unprecedented damage and destruction and a resolve to work together to clean up the affected areas and make our city fit for business again however throughout tuesday tensions were running high and people came out in the evening on dudley road and soho road and in other parts of my constituency to protect their local businesses and to prevent any further damage in the early hours of wednesday morning events took a tragic turn as three of my constituents shazad ali abdul musavir and haroon jahan from the winson green area were murdered while protecting businesses and property on the dudley road in a hit-and-run incident scores of people were present at the scene and many others arrived in the immediate aftermath the men were taken to city hospital where a further crowd gathered concerned and devastated at what had happened winson green is an incredibly tight-knit community in the heart of birmingham the local community do not just consider themselves to be each other\u2019s neighbours and friends but rather they consider themselves family everyone is an aunt or an uncle a brother or a sister it is the best feature of this community which faces significant daily challenges understandably given the loss of three of their own people were distraught and emotions and passions were running high i was involved in many meetings yesterday which brought together community leaders elders inter-faith groups and the police all were keen to express their anger anguish and upset at the events and sought to talk about what had happened and how to prevent any further trouble one of the most important and difficult meetings that took place yesterday was between the police and the local community many of those in attendance witnessed the horrific events of the night before or were there for the aftermath concerns were raised at that meeting about the police presence police response and police numbers as well as the delay in getting ambulances to the scene and other practical and operational issues it is important that once we have seen off the threat of further violence in the area these concerns are thoroughly reviewed and that the police work with the community to learn lessons from what happened and the response to it given the level of anger and the potential for further tension it was important and significant that these concerns were raised with the police by the local community directly and at a grass-roots level and this must continue to happen it was also made clear that keeping the people of winson green updated on the murder investigation is of the utmost importance we know that one man has been arrested and is being questioned by police in connection with the incident and west midlands police inform me that further arrests are possible i was also able to meet and talk to the families of the deceased yesterday words cannot describe what they are feeling right now having lost young men in their prime all three were well known to everyone and were much loved i pay tribute to the families of all three men they have behaved with dignity and calm in the face of truly tragic circumstances in particular i pay tribute to tariq jahan father of haroon jahan we will all have seen him on our tv screens yesterday facing the media and the public having just lost his son his dignity his composure and his heartfelt plea for calm were truly humbling for all of us working to prevent any further trouble in the area yesterday not only did he face the media but he made his pleas directly to the community he arrived on the scene of the public meeting that took place yesterday afternoon and addressed the crowd who had gathered outside because they were unable to get in due to the space constraints tensions were running very high he again appealed for calm he told the people gathered that he wanted the police to have the support that they needed in order to find the people who murdered his son his interventions throughout the day yesterday were instrumental in maintaining calm overnight he set the tone and the community followed i am proud of everyone who last night prevented any trouble from occurring who maintained a peaceful vigil that was dignified and ordered and who heeded the words of tariq jahan and the families i appeal to everyone in the community to continue this calm and responsible attitude over the coming days too in particular i reiterate the vital importance of working with the police to make sure that there is no further trouble i conclude by echoing the words of tariq jahan yesterday addressing the crowds on dudley road he said i lost my son\u2026step forward if you want to lose your sons otherwise calm down and go home i cannot put it any better than that and i urge everyone to remember these words over the coming days and weeks ",

grateful for that intervention because i was going to explain that the new clause is framed in such a way to enable a debate and to create a start for dialogue with the government about how to put in place a mechanism to allow the official opposition and other opposition parties access to the intelligence material that ministers see i was not able to put this into the new clause but the role of the intelligence and security committee might be relevant i am conscious that two of its members are sitting behind me they have access to highly sensitive data and material when they contribute to debates they have that in mind although they cannot in any way tell anyone about it we might be able to have a discussion about the isc\u2019s role so that we can formalise a structure through which information might be shared although i recognise that that any process could not affect its scrutiny function this area is worthy of more detailed discussion with the government so i will be grateful if the minister indicates whether he will be prepared to enter into dialogue with the opposition when we engage in debates of such importance it is important that we can do so on almost the same terms although we recognise that those terms cannot be exactly the same ", " i am grateful to the minister for his comments in light of our brief discussion i beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion ", " i will start with amendment 141 i am grateful to the minister for saying that he will take away some of the points that were made earlier i hope the government will table an amendment on report on which we can proceed with a consensus-based approach if that does not happen the issue will still be of great concern to us we shall certainly seek to continue on report the debate on the annual renewal or sunset clause envisaged in amendment 141 similarly we have had a good debate on amendment 126 and have discussed the transitional arrangements in relation to resources i still have concerns about when those resources will be deployable and ready to go on line when the bill is enacted some of those issues have not been sufficiently canvassed and unless there is further movement from the government we will return to them on report that said i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment ", " i beg to move that the clause be read a second time it is pleasure to rise to speak to the new clause which was tabled following lord carlile\u2019s evidence and in light of the joint committee on human rights report of 2010 opposition members do not have access to the intelligence material that the government do it can be difficult for us to engage fully in debate when we are not aware of all the issues at the forefront of the minds of the home secretary and her ministers when making decisions about counter-terrorism i am conscious that there is a fair bit of knowledge of counter-terrorism issues among opposition members having recently come out of government however the \u00a0new clause envisages a situation in which the opposition have no access even to very recent historical intelligence evidence ", " the point of the amendment is so that the government of the day can be brought to the house to justify an exceptional measure that exists \u00a0in no other part of our legal system such an arrangement has been in place under the prevention of terrorism act 2005 the process of coming back to the house every year concentrates the mind hon members should not forget that the control orders regime changed it was introduced in 2005 in respect of the belmarsh decision and all those subject to it were foreign nationals over time it has changed at the moment it also applies to british nationals the current arrangements allow for an annual debate about the nature of the regime about to whom it applies and about how it works in practice it is important for the government of the day to put its case before the house so that parliament can take a view about whether to continue the regime ", " amendment 141 replicates the position under the prevention of terrorism act 2005 on the continuation of measures for another year it is not about subsequently amending the legislation but about continuing the home secretary\u2019s power to make the measures in the first place it is important that parliament says clearly that the regime is an unattractive and undesirable aspect of our legislative framework but because it is necessary we should continue to question at least annually whether it should remain it would be wrong to decide now that the regime should be a permanent part of our legislative framework without further recourse to parliament the hon gentleman is entitled to his position but we take a different view such an arrangement is important not just for symbolic value but because it would concentrate the mind and continue the position under the 2005 act and that was why i tabled the amendment ", " amendment 141 refers to clause 2 and all other consequential clauses clause 2 is the operative clause of the tpims regime and everything else is as a result of that ", " why does the hon gentleman think that the mere act of having a general election somehow creates a new environment it creates a new political landscape but i am interested in why he thinks it would also create a new security landscape ", " i was going to come on to the evidence given by lord carlile and lord howard the hon gentleman is right that they were clear lord carlile was very clear and i take on board the broad thrust of their point that it is always open to parliament to repeal an act if circumstances change and we feel that it is no longer necessary however there are two reasons why i reject the view of lord carlile and lord howard in this instance first i take on board what the joint committee on human rights said in its 2010 report it looked at the issue of annual renewal in some depth and suggested something that is in some respects stricter that the annual review should involve primary legislation however i propose that the mechanism is the same as that under the 2005 act through statutory instrument the joint committee also considered whether there might be an argument if the debates will be relatively short and everything seems pretty straightforward not \u00a0to have them however my second argument in support of the amendment is the important symbolic value of parliament renewing such powers annually ", " when possible it is best that we work together in the spirit of consensus to reach a settled view however holding an annual review has the important symbolic value of indicating that the measures are exceptional and that we view them as a temporary way to deal with a threat that has presented itself but with which we have no other way of dealing at the moment i have taken on board some of our earlier discussions about the duty to consult and the importance of prosecution under the new regime as compared with the control orders regime i was struck by the exchange between the minister and my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles my right hon friend made the point that that duty to look to prosecution whenever possible is no different under the new regime from under control orders i do not have the direct reference to hand but i recall the minister saying that there was a symbolic importance to having prosecution and that including the desire for prosecution in the bill concentrates the mind i plead those two points in support of amendment 141 there is symbolic importance in parliament saying that it views the measures as exceptional and that we would dearly like to be in a situation in which we do not need them any more so we will consider the position annually that approach would also concentrate the mind because we would have to think regularly  is this something we still need is this something that is still desirable in an ideal world we would have no need for the measures ", " i am certain that my right hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east will gladly explain his position with the customary brilliance that he has already deployed to great effect in committee \u00a0i am speaking to amendment 141 as an opposition front bencher and i refer the hon and learned gentleman to the speech of the shadow home secretary in which she expressed concern about the lack of parliamentary scrutiny as a result of the lack of annual renewal ", " as i said earlier i am certain that my right hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east will fully explain his position the annual review is a judgment call this exceptional and very different feature exists in no other part of our legal system so it is important that we make it clear to the public that we will consider the matter annually and that we do not judge it to be permanent even if the process has only symbolic value it is important that we say that i agree with liberty that  permanent exceptionalism is not desirable ", " i disagree with the hon gentleman it is important that the home secretary is brought to the house each year to justify such an exceptional measure that gives members the opportunity to raise objections that their constituents might have about the regime as i said earlier i think that the process will concentrate the mind the symbolic value of engaging in such a debate is not a fiction the process concentrates the mind and makes us ask ourselves each year  do we still need this in an ideal world we would not have such a system at all i think we are all very clear about that however this is not an ideal world but it is good that parliament has the opportunity to ask itself that question every year for members who feel strongly \u00a0that the regime is so exceptional that we should not have it and who object to it on a point of principle it is important that they have an opportunity to put their argument ", " i am sorry but i did not hear the hon gentleman ", " clearly in an ideal world we would not have the need for control orders or tpims because we would be able to meet the risks that we face through our normal system however this is not an ideal world for various reasons we cannot convert the intelligence material that we are able to get on these individuals into evidence for use in a court of law i think that i am being very clear and i have not said anything different from what the position has always been but if there was a lack of clarity let me make the point again our position has always been that we would not need such a regime in an ideal world but this is not an ideal world intelligence material cannot always be converted into evidence that can be presented before a jury in a court of law at the moment we therefore need another system for dealing with such individuals ", " i agree with the thrust of what my hon friend says ", " i beg to move amendment 126 in clause 27 page 15 line 35 leave out from \u2018act\u2019 to end of line and insert \u00a0\u2018will come into force the day after the home secretary reports to parliament to confirm that paragraphs (a) (b) and (c) below have been complied with (a) no later than one month after the day on which this act is passed the senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism will in consultation with other relevant police organisations and the security services produce a report to the home secretary detailing the additional required resources ( required resources ) that will be needed to manage the increased risks arising from the repeal of the prevention of terrorism act 2005 and the passing of this act (b) no later than two months after the day on which this act is passed the home secretary will agree with the senior national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism the required resources under paragraph (a) and the timetable for such required resources becoming deployable for use in implementing and managing measures relating to tpim notices (c) this act cannot come into force until the required resources as agreed under paragraph (b) above are made available and ready for deployment \u2019 ", " resources have been much discussed in committee the thrust of amendment 126 came from the evidence of dac osborne in our first evidence-gathering session committee members may find it helpful if i take them back to the important part of that evidence that relates to amendment 126 dac osborne told my right hon friend the member for salford and eccles that the police were comfortable with the control order regime because it had had time to bed in and they were used to the system and resources and the interplay between them i asked dac osborne what time scales he was working to in relation to the bedding-in process for the tpim regime he replied to get the resources that we anticipate we need will take more than a year in terms of being able to get people trained and to get the right equipment until we have got that we will not be able to start to bed things in and see how it works and how it transpires it also depends on how many people actually go on to the tpims regime and how many people come off it \u2013\u2013[official report terrorism prevention and investigation measures public bill committee 21 june 2011 c 9 q27 ]that concerned me because nothing in the bill allows for the gap between the passing of the bill and the act coming into force and the resources needed by the police being in place it is not only a question of money it is about the extra surveillance that will be required given that some control orders will no longer be available under the tpim regime primarily they are what i would call the curfew measures the overnight residence requirements the period of which will be shorter than that available under the control order system and the relocation measures which will not be available under the tpim regime thus requiring much greater use of surveillance officers as dac osborne said in response to a question from the hon and learned member for sleaford and north hykeham it takes about 12 months to train surveillance officers and ensure that they are ready to be deployed in a challenging security environment the aim of the amendment is to prevent a gap arising between the time at which resources are made available by the home office and the time at which they come online ", " with respect to the hon and learned gentleman we are dealing with a bill relating to terrorism which is incredibly serious such bills are very different in nature from other measures the thrust of my amendment is to deal with the issue of resources coming online we are moving from a regime under which additional resources were not necessary because of the nature of the measures in place to one in which there will be greater risk which the government say can be managed by the provision of those additional resources the amendment would prevent the time gap and the additional risk that it will cause ", " i am not aware off the top of my head of such an act of parliament but that is not a good point because the amendment does not seek to frustrate the government\u2019s purpose in introducing the tpim regime but to mitigate a risk that we heard about from dac osborne it does not matter if it has not arisen in another act of parliament i do not think that dac osborne has given that kind of evidence before and i am very worried about that security gap ", " with respect the hon gentleman misses the point of the amendment the control order regime allowed for a range of measures for which a different level of resource was required and where there was a different security environment for the police to operate in the new regime has a lesser menu with two specific measures no longer available the curfew for 16 hours and the relocation provision so not only money but greater resources will be required we heard evidence from lord carlile who said that under control orders it cost about \u00a31 8 million per control order but now there is a risk of a tpim costing around \u00a318 million it is not just about money but about the extra surveillance officers required people will no longer be kept in their home for up to 16 hours or be relocated somewhere where they do not have contacts with their friends so they can get on with planning attacks therefore more surveillance will be required dac osborne clearly said that training a surveillance officer so that they were ready to be deployed in a security environment of the kind envisaged under the tpim regime would take more than a year it is because he said that that i have tabled the amendment ", " i agree that it is important to amend the bill to satisfy members and the wider public that not just the home secretary but the police are confident that everything is in place for the tpims regime to go online i considered suggesting a time limit or including consequential amendments for the provision of 28 days increasing that period to one year but i felt it was more important to address the essential issue of resources ", " i accept what the minister says i do not pretend that the drafting of the amendment is absolutely clear-cut and ready for inclusion in the bill the amendment is of a probing nature however if such an amendment were accepted i would envisage that the control orders regime would continue until the resources are online and we can move to the new tpim regime i want to put in place a mechanism for the discussion between the home secretary and the police and security services on resources which should be ready to come online i am aware however that there is already a system in place in the first evidence session dac osborne told us about the draft business plan that went to the home office the previous friday presumably there is already a home office structure in place i am therefore ready to accept the fact that proposed new paragraphs (a) and (b) may be overtaken by the systems that the home office has in place for the consideration of the draft business case dac osborne told us that that would take around two to three weeks he was not able to give us greater clarity but perhaps the minister could discuss that in his response the simple fact is that it takes a long time to train surveillance officers dac osborne was clear about that we will need many more of them when we move to the tpim regime ", " my right hon friend makes a powerful point we have discussed the olympics before in committee and they will be a major concern for the public as well as for all hon members she makes a good argument about the drain on resources and the ability of the police to cope with the increased threat due to the olympics as well as with the new tpim regime possibly at a time when the extra surveillance officers are not ready to be deployed immediately dac osborne spoke about assets too i assume that there would be requirements for other technical assets i am a tech-know-nothing so i do not know what they might be but he made it clear that there would be additional assets i can only guess that they must be of a technical variety but that they would have to be designed ordered and made to order for the home office i cannot imagine that that task can be completed merely in weeks i assume that that is why he made it clear that it would take more than a year for them to be completely ready and for the new regime to bed in so that it works as effectively as the control order regime the intention of the amendment is not to frustrate the will of the government in introducing the new regime but merely to prevent a security gap arising as a result of resources taking some time to come online and being ready to be deployed amendment 141 like other parts of the bill is a direct lift from the prevention of terrorism act 2005 it relates to the annual renewal of the powers granted to the secretary of state and makes it necessary to bring them back to the house so that they can be allowed to run for an additional year essentially it is a sunset clause the amendment is based on oral evidence that we received from liberty and justice which were both very clear about the importance of bringing the powers back to parliament every year for annual renewal and confirmation that they are still needed i do not think that opposition members have often agreed with the position taken by liberty in relation to control orders however i was struck by the fact that when shami chakrabarti gave evidence on behalf of liberty she said to be fair she choked on these words that she would take the current control orders regime with annual renewal rather than the new tpim regime ", " i wanted briefly to refer the minister to subsection (9) on the duty to consult which might be satisfied by consultation that took place wholly or partly before the passing of this act i assume that that is a context point i know that the minister is fond of context designed to ensure that there will be no gap when the act comes into force affecting individuals whom the police and security services have had under review with a view to their becoming subject to tpim notices how would the provision affect people who are subject to control orders presumably there is a process for reviewing whether those individuals would migrate from \u00a0a control order to a tpim notice what consultation will take place and what interplay will there be with subsection (9) with respect to the current 12 or so control orders ", "to ask the secretary of state for justice whether a risk assessment was undertaken as part of the transfer of hmp birmingham to g4s ", "despite what the minister has said about impact assessments it is surprising and deeply worrying that the government are pursuing a policy which on their own view will cost the country \u00a32 4 billion and which on their own view will have only half the impact on net migration that they originally said this policy was part of a package of changes that the government said would reduce net migration to the tens of thousands by 2015 in support of the policy the prime minister said in april to tory party members no ifs no buts that\u2019s a promise we made to the british people and it is a promise we are keeping well not according to his government\u2019s own impact assessment and not according to the migration observatory ", "thank you mr speaker i was just about to will the minister be upfront and admit today that this is a promise that he and the prime minister will not be keeping ", " rose ", " i do not agree that it is a bad point i do not accept the argument that the home secretary is forced to impose control order measures that would not be available to her under the tpim regime and which are contrary to the counter-terrorism review because of resources that is not entirely correct if that were the case the bill would include a clause providing that it would not come into force until such time as the police had confirmed to the home secretary and parliament that they had the additional resources needed to manage the increased risk created by the tpim regime and that the additional police officers needed to undertake surveillance were fully trained and ready to start work there is no such clause the resources argument cannot be used both ways it cannot be used to say that the home secretary is correct to use control order measures as she has done over the past few months but allow the resources point to fall away when the bill comes into force ", " i welcome and endorse the powerful and persuasive contributions made by my right hon and hon friends given the detail of the arguments already made i will keep my remarks brief but i have two points to which i hope the minister will respond i shall focus on the fact that clause 1 seeks to abolish control orders and the rest of the bill will essentially bring them back i endorse the point made by my right hon friends the members for salford and eccles and for wythenshawe and sale east that to have an honest debate the government should have tabled amendments to the 2005 act the overnight residence measure which we will debate at length highlights the fiction that the government are getting rid of control orders and introducing something fundamentally different because very conveniently the overnight residence measure is not defined in the bill under the control order regime at the moment a curfew can be imposed for up to 16 hours the hon member for carshalton and wallington believes that it will be left to judges to decide from cases that will no doubt flow from the measure what the overnight residence measure really means i am sure that some conservative members will be astonished to discover that the government are inviting judicial activism under the human rights act 1998 and the european convention on human rights i think that that is the wrong way to proceed i take on board very strongly the point made by the hon member for beckenham who said that we are making law if the government believe that curfews of 16 hours are wrong and they want to do something that is fundamentally different and much shorter in practice for the people who are not under curfew for 16 hours they should spell that out they should have the courage of their convictions and put that in the bill they have left it open because the home secretary since coming to power has imposed and defended curfews and control orders of up to 16 hours the counter-terrorism review reported in january and at that point it was open to the home secretary to say that she would not seek to impose any measures in a control order that fell foul of the new tpims regime that she was going to introduce and that fall foul of the findings of the counter-terrorism review that is obviously not the case ", " no that is not what i am saying the point is that the government have committed themselves to a counter-terrorism review and its findings so they should be consistent it was open to the home secretary to say that she would not seek to impose restrictions that fell foul of the review but that is not the case because she has supported 16-hour curfews and relocation and she has defended them since the review was published i want the minister to focus on those points when he explains to us why control orders have been abolished and not been brought back by the tpims regime because in fact they have ", " i entirely disagree with the hon and learned gentleman the additional resources that would be needed by the police will not be online and deployable by them even when the bill is passed [ interruption ] no that is exactly the same point we heard from mr osborne that it would take up to a year possibly more to train the extra surveillance officers who will be needed and to make them deployable to meet the requirements of the new regime that is not what the bill envisages the measure will come into force 28 days after the bill is passed the minister needs to focus on resources when he responds this is an important and sensitive topic we must debate it in an honest and open way so that we do not present a picture to the public that says that we have got rid of control orders and we have something fundamentally different when that is patently not the case ", " the hon gentleman talks about curfews will he explain how a curfew of 16 hours is practically and fundamentally different from the overnight residence measure envisaged under the tpim regime ", " with the exception of relocation will the hon gentleman explain why he believes tpims are fundamentally and practically different from control orders dr huppert  rose ", "to ask the secretary of state for business innovation and skills what representations he has received on the effects on women of changes to the provision of courses of english for

that annual review and renewal by parliament should have been retained in the bill ", " lord carlile in your role as the reviewer you were privy to information that is not available to all of us given your detailed knowledge of the cases that give rise to control orders how would you rate the importance of the relocation condition compared with the other conditions that might have been imposed what prominence would you give to relocation ", " if i could take you both back to the issue of parliamentary scrutiny the control orders regime was up for renewal in parliament on an annual basis the current regime in the bill once passed is permanent do you think that annual review by parliament is important and would you have retained it in this bill ", " i welcome all the witnesses mr osborne i want to ask a quick follow-up question about your earlier point about the business case that you submitted last friday can you tell us the time scale for its consideration when might you expect to hear ", " mr osborne you said earlier in response to a question from hazel blears that you are very comfortable with the current regime because it has bedded in and everybody knows what they are doing

two sciences and history or geography in 2010 ", "i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the current uk regime that allows for the collection of pnr data and their use for both immigration control and combating terrorism was brought in by the previous labour government through their creation and roll-out of the e-borders programme we therefore recognise the vital importance of the role played by pnr data to achieve both those policy objectives given that pnrs are a proven tool for the prevention and detection of serious crime and terrorism we believe that it is sensible to have a europe-wide regime to ensure similarity of methodology and approach to pnr rather than have member states going their own way and making individual agreements we are thus supportive of the uk decision to opt in to the directive we note the different approach taken by the conservatives now that they sit on the government front bench to eu co-operation on home affairs and justice matters that was not something they championed in opposition but as we have seen with their change of heart on the extension of the european arrest warrant and their position on pnr data today that is what happens when rhetoric confronts reality it is a shame that the minister took such a long time to sign the directive on human trafficking where the reality is so shocking as the minister has already told us the biggest change between the first draft directive and the new draft directive is the inclusion of intra-eu flights within its scope that is a positive step as the minister and i discussed in european committee b the inclusion of intra-eu flights is necessary to prevent a security gap from emerging will the minister tell us whether negotiations are continuing with the member states that have not yet expressed support for the proposal in particular germany and give us his assessment of the effectiveness of the directive without universal support for the inclusion of intra-eu flights i note from the new draft directive that the new article 1(a) leaves open the ability of member states to decide which intra-eu routes they wish to include in their pnr data collection coverage and i note from the minister\u2019s statement that in the uk at least that willfocus data collection on routes that are considered to be high risk however there is a danger that that will displace the problem rather than deal with it if potential criminals and terrorists know that certain routes are being targeted they are likely to move to other routes is the minister confident that we have the necessary flexibility and resources to pre-empt that and to ensure that we keep pace with what is a constantly changing and developing security picture one of the questions i raised with the minister when this matter was last debated in the house was whether all terrorism offences under the terrorism acts 2000 and 2006 would be within the scope of the directive allowing pnr data to be collected and shared the minister has written to me i note that he does not yet know whether all those offences will be covered and that complex legal analysis will be required during the negotiations to determine the overlap between definitions in the directive and those in our domestic legislation the uk regime for counter-terrorism reflects the uk\u2019s national experience and is therefore more extensive in some ways than the regimes of other european union states legislative parity given the extensive provisions of the terrorism acts will therefore be vital may i impress on the minister the importance of keeping that point under review and will he assure the house that it will be a priority as negotiations continue one of the important features of the uk\u2019s internal arrangements is that through the e-borders programme we can use api and pnr data together and can use both types of data set for crime fighting and immigration control purposes i know that the minister agrees that the full benefits of e-borders are realised when api and pnr data are collected and used together i have asked the minister before whether he thinks that the current directive is sufficiently clear to enable the uk to continue to use pnr data for immigration control purposes but i note that the potentially relevant paragraphs of the draft directive remain unchanged will the minister assure the house that signing up to the draft directive will not diminish or weaken the uk\u2019s e-borders programme in any way and that he will continue to press for clarity in the directive in order to leave no doubt that member states can collect and use pnr data not just in respect of terrorism and serious crime but for immigration control there should be no unintended consequences that would prevent the uk from maintaining effective control of its border the draft directive currently states that pnr data will be collected and retained for a period of 30 days after which it will be anonymised and held for a further five years the uk government have been pressing for the data to be held for much longer than that first will the minister tell the house where the negotiations stand in relation to that important part of the proposal secondly will he explain how this conforms with the coalition government\u2019s emphasis on the removal of data held for the purposes of fighting serious crime that is what they are doing by weakening the dna database under the protection of freedoms bill but they do not seem to be particularly concerned about itin the context of the directive does the minister believe that the government are adopting a consistent approach or will they continue to be as they are at present all over the place using appropriate information in the fight against serious crime and terrorism is of course entirely necessary we welcome this european initiative which may make the government think again about the fight against other serious crime ", "to ask the secretary of

outset for the benefit of the house the approach adopted to counter-terrorism matters by the shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for morley and outwood (ed balls) \"we the opposition will take an evidence-based approach which gives the greatest importance to national security in coming to a view on counter-terrorism issues and therefore wherever possible we will seek to work with the government and will seek consensus \"to that end i can tell the house that despite frequent earlier requests my right hon friend received only in the past hour a privy council briefing on the organisation that is the subject of the order as i have said we are happy to seek a consensus-based approach on matters of national security but i point out to government front benchers that that would be helped along somewhat if they provided privy council briefings in a more timely manner ", "i will return to the issue of hizb ut-tahrir shortly and hopefully deal with the substance of the hon gentleman's intervention i have a number of questions about the order for the minister paragraph 7 2 of the explanatory memorandum states \"the secretary of state has regard to additional criteria (announced by the secretary of state in 2001) in deciding as a matter of discretion whether or not to proscribe an organisation these are the nature and scale of the organisation's activities the specific threat that it poses to the uk the specific threat that it poses to british nationals overseas the extent of the organisation's presence in the uk the need to support international partners in the fight against terrorism\" those criteria seem to be perfectly sensible in providing the basic test against which a secretary of state may decide to exercise his or her discretion but will the minister shed some light on how in this particular case they have been applied the 2001 criteria are not contained in primary or secondary legislation so in light of that are they under regular review by the home office will he give us some details about how the government intend to keep them under review how frequently will that be done given that the criteria were stated first in 2001 does the minister consider them to be fully comprehensive still could they usefully be added to and are there any plans to do so he will be aware that there is a large and settled british pakistani community in this country and many british citizens from that community travel regularly to pakistan to visit family and friends what is his assessment of the threat that tehrik-e taliban pakistan poses to them that will be a matter of some interest to the british pakistani community so i hope that he will take this opportunity to address it related to that is tehrik-e taliban pakistan operative in this country how has the threat that the organisation poses in this country changed since it was set up in 2007 and what is the extent of its operations in this country the minister will also be aware that as a result of the devastating floods in pakistan last year the effects of which are still being felt by the pakistani population a large number of british aid workers operate in pakistan and are involved in vital efforts to provide humanitarian relief and assistance to the flood affectees soon after the floods tehrik-e taliban pakistan made a number of statements widely reported in the british media threatening british aid workers will the minister update the house on the threat posed to british aid workers engaged in flood relief work in pakistan and will he give some detail about the efforts being made to provide the maximum possible security and support to them the organisation was set up in 2007 proscribed by the pakistani authorities in 2008 and designated by the united states in september 2010 what prompted the government to follow suit now how was the timing of the decision arrived at there is of course necessary and close co-operation between the pakistani authorities and the government in combating terrorism is the minister confident that the government are doing enough to support the pakistani authorities and society as a whole to prevent the rise of tehrik-e taliban pakistan ", "i am grateful to my right hon friend for his intervention in fact i intended to put that question to the minister in relation to any plans that the government might have to look again at the legal process of appeal for an organisation that has been proscribed i know that in previous debates when the previous labour government proscribed organisations my right hon friend raised the potential deficiencies in the processes for proscription and for challenging proscription so can the minister state the government's plans in that regard do we know whether other countries intend to proscribe the organisation in the near future what co-operation has there been between the government and our allies engaged in operations in afghanistan and other parts of the world in terms of proscribing it will there be continued co-operation and what is the extent of such work will the minister give the house some details about the procedure by which the government intend to keep the list of proscribed organisations under review will such reviews take place monthly quarterly or less regularly and can we be confident that all organisations that pose a threat to our national security are proscribed the house will be aware that during today's prime minister's questions my hon friend the member for eltham (clive efford) asked the prime minister about his plans to proscribe another organisation hizb ut-tahrir this was also mentioned by the minister although hizb ut-tahrir is not subject to this order the prime minister's comments about it raise questions about the government's policy on proscription as a whole further to what was said at prime minister's questions my right hon friend the shadow secretary of state has written to the prime minister and the home secretary let me refer to his letter because it is important for the house to know this his letter points out that last year the prime minister made a commitment to banning hizb ut-tahrir\"despite having not seen any of the evidence\" he continues \"the clear suggestion was that proscribing this organisation was a simple act that could be made without any legal obstacles on the basis of the evidence\"that was available in the public domain he asks the prime minister a number of questions which i will repeat for the minister to comment on he asks the prime minister when he intends to fulfil his commitment on hizb ut-tahrir and on what dates the prime minister and the home secretary have met to discuss the matter he asks \"will you share with me on privy council terms\"-and one hopes in a timely way-\"the latest available evidence about\"hizb ut-tahrir's\"activities \"he says \"on the basis of the available evidence is it still your intention to proscribe this organisation \"and asks whether the prime minister has\"any plans to amend the relevant legal tests\"as set out in the terrorism act 2000 and amended in the terrorism act 2006 perhaps the minister could shed some light on the government's response to those questions because it is important that the house has placed before it the government's exact procedures and intentions in relation to proscription proscription should be a matter of last resort in order to safeguard our national security and not the subject of off-the-cuff remarks or ill-thought-out pronouncements by the prime minister when he was leader of the opposition as i have said we will work with the government to protect our national security and in that spirit we will support the order ", "given what the minister has just said is it his view that the prime minister as leader of the opposition made a mistake when he said that he would ban hizb ut-tahrir ", "will the minister give way ", "i am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this debate especially as the scrapping of ema is second only to the rise in tuition fees as the issue on which i have received the largest amount of correspondence the government are certainly politicising vast numbers of young people albeit in the worst possible way and with the worst possible policies the government's decision to scrap ema represents a vicious attack on the aspirations of young people in our country especially the most disadvantaged the scale of support that is being withdrawn is shocking our young people will bear a very heavy burden indeed the chancellor once stated that he would not balance the budget on the backs of the poor-a statement that fell apart as soon as he uttered it-but it seems that in addition to balancing the budget on the backs of the poor the government also intend to balance it on the backs of the young the message from the treasury bench today is clear if you happen to be young and poor you're stuffed the scrapping of ema has particular resonance in my constituency of birmingham ladywood my constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the country and one of the reasons why it is blighted by long-term unemployment is the legacy of the recession of the '80s the decision of the then tory government to walk away from young people and to say that unemployment was a price worth paying created a lost generation of young people in birmingham ladywood and across birmingham as a whole now as a result of the decisions of this tory-lib dem government the children of that lost generation will become the new lost generation of our time that is a cruel and deplorable state of affairs and represents a dereliction of the government's duty to the young of our country the ema has three main purposes-increasing participation increasing attendance and thus increasing attainment-and achieves them because of how young people use ema they use it primarily for travel which learner support funds cannot be used for being able to travel to the institution that offers the best course for each student is crucial it may be the single most important reason why attainment rates have improved students also use ema to buy books and other materials because ema provides additional financial assistance students have the financial leeway either not to take a part-time job or to decrease the hours they work enabling them to focus on getting the best possible grades and qualifications to make a better future for themselves that is a point made forcefully to me by staff and students using the connexions service in birmingham which supports young people in birmingham to go into education employment or training the service has already faced massive cuts including the closure of the aston branch in my constituency but it does crucial work students supported by connexions staff have written to me with their views about ema all those students and the staff who work with them tell me that without ema they would not have stayed in post-16 education or would not have done as well all of them have used their ema for help with travel and equipment my discussions with them have shown me that ema is especially crucial for students on vocational courses as someone who represents a constituency that is 60% non-white i am also especially concerned about the effect that removal of ema will have on ethnic minority students and their post-16 participation and attainment rates some 70% of british pakistani students in full-time education receive ema the figure is 84% for bangladeshi students 56% for black african students and 50% for black caribbean students in that context it is totally unacceptable that the government have failed to carry out an equality impact assessment on its policy of scrapping ema the birmingham and solihull principals group has told me \"there are going to be a lot of casualties out of this who will never escape poverty as a result of this cut\" i hope that government members will bear that in mind when they vote ", "to ask the secretary of state for education how many children in birmingham ladywood constituency have received the education maintenance allowance (ema) since its inception and how much ema has been paid out to such children in that period ", "to ask the secretary of state for education how many students in birmingham ladywood receive education maintenance allowance (ema) and what steps his department is taking to assist students who will not receive ema in the next academic year to prepare for its replacement ", "does my hon friend agree that school-based police officers are crucial and make a huge difference that is noted by parents teachers and local residents and in particular by students themselves he might be interested to know that i was lobbied last week by year 7 and 9 pupils from small heath school in my constituency-incidentally it is my former school they were lamenting the loss of their local police constable pc inglis who had been based at their school for a number of years and had made such an impact on the students and on antisocial behaviour the rates of which had declined significantly ", "i am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate i would like to focus on three elements first my concerns regarding the impact of the devastating cuts to local government in the recent financial settlement which i believe do not correlate with the government's professed desire for localism and giving more power to local people secondly the arrangements in the bill for directly elected mayors in 12 major english cities including my own city of birmingham and thirdly the provisions in relation to housing i support the principle of giving people a greater say in how their communities and services are run but that has to take place in tandem with two things fairly funded local authorities and thereby fairly funded local services and investment in the capacity and skills of local people to enable them to take control regardless of their social background through the bill the government try to talk a good game however it comes at a time when the government at the centre have made a choice giving local authorities a devastating financial settlement that was far worse than expected with the worst cuts for a generation the government seem to think that merely by saying that they are committed to localism and by repeating their lines in support of local people taking control at local level that somehow as if by magic true localism will emerge however without a fair settlement for local government no such localism can emerge the bill seems to give a huge amount with one hand but the government through the financial choices that they have made are taking a lot more away with the other the simple truth is that localism cannot deliver for local people if all the decisions being made at local level are focused on implementing centrally-imposed cuts that are going too far and are too deep ", "i am afraid that that is a rather poor attempt at hiding the deep unfairness of the settlement imposed on local government by this government that was a choice that could have been made differently but was not ", "i agree with my hon friend entirely and i was just coming to that point i fear that it is the cuts that will define the future shape life chances and success or lack thereof of birmingham residents not the localism bill the provisional local government settlement for birmingham was a confirmation of the worst-case scenario birmingham has to make savings of approximately \u00a3170 million pounds in the next two years and is one of the hardest hit local authorities in fact \"one of the hardest hit\" is a depressing and hideous phrase that the people of birmingham are having to get used to after being one of the hardest hit areas in the police settlement the sheer size of the cuts in birmingham will prevent the people of birmingham from getting the most out of the localism agenda more affluent areas which have perversely done better out of the local government financial settlement have greater scope to gain more from localism i fear a prevailing culture where those with the deepest pockets will be more able to make themselves heard if the government truly want localism to be a success and want strong local communities up and down the country they first need to revisit the unfair settlement for local government anything less than that is a hollow and unworkable localism which will not deliver for every community the bill also creates arrangements for directly elected mayors in 12 major english cities including birmingham i am in favour of giving local people a choice as to whether they want a directly elected mayor for their area an elected mayor could offer highly effective local leadership and i supported the introduction of this model of local government when it was introduced by the labour government however i am against imposition the bill imposes a shadow mayor on the people of birmingham subject to a confirmatory referendum that aspect needs to be considered again the people of birmingham are quite capable of deciding for themselves whether they want to have a directly elected mayor rather than having one imposed from the centre by the secretary of state subject to later endorsement where may i ask is the localism in that if the secretary of state truly trusted local people to exercise their own judgment about what is right for their area he would not choose this path earlier the secretary of state was asked about his motive for introducing shadow mayors he said that it was so that people could get ready for having a mayor people are not stupid they do not need a practice run dictated to them by the secretary of state let them make their decision and simply get on with it i am concerned that the shadow arrangements-making the leader of the local authority in the 12 cities the shadow mayor-will create a systemic bias in favour of the shadow mayor and will make it more difficult for people from all walks of life to put themselves forward for mayorship that creates an imbalance in favour of the shadow mayor and regardless of whether that individual is a labour tory or liberal democrat councillor the principle is not sound and is anti-democratic the bill also makes a number of changes to the duties of local authorities in relation to housing every single week since i was elected in may i have met constituents at my advice surgeries who are desperate for housing people who are on the waiting list for social housing people who have been waiting many years for a transfer to more suitable social housing accommodation people on the verge of being made homeless and young people despairing of ever getting on to the social housing ladder i am therefore reminded every week of the urgent need to increase the stock of social and affordable housing given that i wish to make two points about the current changes first the changes to the current system are not taking place in isolation they are doing so with huge changes to housing benefit rules and therefore councils and social landlords will be under huge pressure i am not convinced that the changes introduced in the bill will do anything to alleviate that pressure the proposals will have to be looked at carefully in committee secondly the real challenge is to ensure that more homes are being built i am alarmed at the reduction in funding for new social homes and the warnings and figures from various groups involved in building homes research recently published by the national housing federation shows that since the general election local authorities have ditched plans for 160 000 new homes it believes that once the homes that labour started building are complete no new social homes will be built for the next five years that would be a complete disaster and i suggest that that should be looked at urgently no amount of changes to the current system can compensate for the lack of available social and affordable homes getting to grips with that should be the priority at this stage in conclusion the bill has promised much but the scale of the cuts being imposed on local government and the deficiencies in some of the bill's proposals will mean that it delivers very little ", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions what estimate has been made of the number of pensioners whose income is likely to fall below the 60 per cent median

statute book as quickly as possible and feeling passionately about it-and i have no doubt that she feels passionately about it-and bypassing proper scrutiny in a bill committee and giving people

important debate about the future of our education system good education available to all is the foundation stone of our society which is why it arouses such passion in all parts of the house as we have heard in all today's speeches the bill is intended to change the education system as we know it and has been presented in a manner that has deliberately prevented wide debate discussion and consultation rather than leading to greater social justice it will deliver only social segregation for those reasons i oppose it the first problem is the way in which the debate has come before the house i am a new member and still learning the ways and methods of the house but it was with alarm and shock that i found that the only other legislation that had been passed through the house with such speed and lack of debate was anti-terror legislation which is understandable and the dangerous dogs act 1991 which is hardly an example that we should all seek to follow i have to ask whether that is what the so-called new politics is all about-employing such speed and lack of debate to bring about legislation that will fundamentally alter the way in which education that most enabling of public services is delivered the bill should be given proper scrutiny and there should be a proper opportunity for widespread consultation with the general public parents and stakeholders i suggest that the reason why the bill has come before us in this way is that the coalition government know that it will not hold up to scrutiny which is why they will not allow it they know that they have used the previous labour government's academies programme as a way to sell their version of academies which are something entirely different-so different that they should not be called the same thing the labour academies programme was about social justice whereas the bill is about the free market the focus of our programme was to target areas of disadvantage and inequality to seek to ensure that all pupils regardless of their socio-economic background had access to high-quality education the bill has no such focus as shown by the fact that under the current policy schools that are considered outstanding by ofsted are to be pre-approved grammar schools will also be allowed to become academies something expressly prevented by the labour government that can lead only to social segregation not social justice the government would have us all believe that they are progressives now and that the liberal democrat partners in the coalition have an influence in government that is bringing a progressive dimension to their collective policies i ask the lib dems to examine the bill recognise that it allows for an expansion of selection and ask themselves what on earth is progressive about that it is perverse also that a school that is already deemed outstanding will get a chance to become better surely that move by the secretary of state more than anything else gives away his true motive for the bill if it were about driving up standards and improving the quality of education that our children receive he would have made express mention of those matters in the bill and would not have pre-approved already outstanding schools ", "tony blair is no longer the leader of my party and i was elected in may 2010 although i agree with much of what he did when he was prime minister and leader of our great party i do not agree with all of what he said and did that was not the point that i was making however which was about the bill and the fact that it focuses on pre-approving outstanding schools that gives away what it is all about-creating a two-tier system ", "i wish to make some progress in any case the fact that so many schools are currently outstanding shows that excellence is alive and well in the maintained system and that there is no need to move towards the free schools model one of the freedoms that the bill promises new academies and free schools is freedom from local authority control i have to ask where is the evidence that a system that is entirely independent with schools free to do as they please is more effective than what we have at the moment under labour academies were successful because disadvantaged schools were given the opportunity for a fresh start and a clear focus with a dedicated commitment to making them better in many ways they were more government-controlled rather than being free furthermore i thought that the new politics was all about engaging with the public and including them in the decisions that are made especially at local level well many people see education as one of their major public services and they would expect to be able to monitor control and hold to account that service through their elected local authority to break that link through the apparatus of the state is profoundly undemocratic and should be rejected new academies and free schools are also promised freedom from the national curriculum i agree entirely with the right hon member for yeovil (mr laws) who stated on \"newsnight\" on 10 march this year that that was one of the \"dottiest\" aspects of tory education policy if only such frankness about it were to be found now on his party's benches on the same programme the secretary of state said about the national curriculum \"i think it is important that we have a piece of infrastructure in the public realm which people can admire and which they can use as a benchmark but which we can depart from where appropriate\" that shows a fundamental misunderstanding the national curriculum determines what our children learn to equip them-each and every one bar none-to make their way in the world and especially the world of work it is about passing on knowledge from one generation to another which is an important part of the make-up of our society to allow some schools to opt out and determine what our kids learn according to the whims of a particular head teacher or governing body is indeed dotty ", "because it is important for the state sector to set out the way in which we believe our children should be taught there should be a minimum standard and a minimum curriculum so that children all get the same level and type of education no matter what background they are from or what their social class is that must not have an impact on what they learn at school i am also deeply concerned that the duty to consult on the part of those wishing to set up an academy or a free school is extremely weak there was not one at all to begin with but the one that has been inserted since the debate in the house of lords is still too flexible and therefore weak there must be a full and meaningful consultation on the initial application with parents teachers children other staff the local authority and others schools are the heart of local communities the inadequate provisions for consultation will sever that link and must be tightened up i conclude by drawing the attention of the house to a recent ipsos mori poll which showed that 95% of people wanted a good local school under the control of the local authority there is no need to spend millions of pounds on creating an entirely new structure when a good regime for schools exists and has delivered rising standards year on year especially where that new structure will lead to greater social segregation what makes a difference to standards is the quality of teaching in a school i was lucky enough to have some fantastic teachers and i am convinced that whatever educational successes i have enjoyed were down to their hard work and encouragement changing a school's structural status does not mean that one has waved a magic wand and that teaching and learning will automatically improve instead as a result of the bill we will move to a two-tier system and systemic unfairness will be built into our education provision we will all be worse off for it ", "the hon lady says the coalition is very concerned to remove disadvantage within our education system if that is the case why is it that under these proposals the first schools to become academies will be those that are already deemed to be outstanding ", "the government are already hitting hard new deal programmes that were designed to help some of our most deprived communities in areas such as aston which is in my constituency is it true that the plan is now to cut off funding from the middle of the financial year-from this october-thereby sacking staff and damaging some of our most

amendment i have been reading what government members say about themselves and apparently we are all progressives now if that is true we should recognise that fairness is at the heart of what it is to be a true progressive on the point of fairness people bought the cards in good faith an earlier intervention referred to card-holders having a passport at the same time people were eligible to apply for a card if they had a passport or a recently expired one so some of the people who now have identity cards will not have an up-to-date passport that is within the identity cards act 2006 having bought their cards in good faith people have a legitimate expectation that the government will honour the expiry date of the identity cards the minister and some government members suggested this

that the public should therefore not have bought the cards is arrogant and insulting and it treats the electorate with contempt it beggars belief that that can be a suitable argument to put forward for not adequately compensating people who did something that was perfectly legitimate within the law and passed by an act of parliament it is extremely unfair if the government are going to send out a message to members of the public that they should look at what parties say when they are electioneering and then act accordingly in terms of the decisions that they make in their personal life i would tell them to look at what those same parties do when they get into government we have the recent example of the reversal of the position on vat taken by the conservative and liberal democrat parties mrs epstein and other members of the public should draw the conclusion that they should listen to what parties say when they are electioneering and then assume that they are going to do the exact opposite from the minister\u2019s case this morning mrs epstein and the other 12 000 or 13 000 people who paid for id cards could have formed the very reasonable conclusion that even though they were saying that they were going to get rid of id cards they are in fact going to keep them ", " i thank my hon friend for that intervention i confess that even though i was a lawyer in my previous life contract law was not my specialty it was professional negligence so i cannot verify the accuracy of that statement however it is certainly something to consider ", " i thank my hon friend for her intervention that is an important point of principle we would have liked to have tabled an amendment about compensation and repayment of the \u00a330 but as other hon friends have said that is not possible because of the way in which the bill is worded so this is effectively the next best or alternative option as my hon friend the shadow minister said earlier we already have in circulation a number of different cards they are small in number but they are still legal tender when it comes to proving identity i submit that continuing that in relation to these id cards would not be any more troublesome than the list of other id proofs already in circulation i simply end on this point it is extremely arrogant to put forward an argument that people should have guessed and known effectively have behaved like mystic megs what the government would do as soon as they got into power that is very unfair the tone of this morning\u2019s point seemed to suggest that the people who bought the id cards even though the tories and the lib dems were saying that they would get rid of them were somehow idiotic to have done so i find that insulting i do not know whether any of my constituents have bought id cards but if they have i would feel extremely insulted on their behalf that point needs to be made publicly and put on the record it is only fair for people to be allowed to retain their cards and use them until the expiry date that is not too much to ask and the government should look into that ", " does my hon friend agree that citizens of a country are entitled to hold their government to a higher standard than a private enterprise we expect more of our government than we do of private companies ", " will my hon friend give way ", " does my hon friend agree that in 2006 the date of the act that is being repealed it would have been ridiculous for the then government to put in a cancellation clause on the chance that they would lose the next general election why would they undo what they were putting forward as their policy ", " is the minister\u2019s case that the general public should have known that the tories and lib dems would be elected at the last general election ", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs pursuant to the answer to the hon member for west bromwich east of 9 june 2010 official report column 148w on

contribution in the house especially as today's debate has particular resonance for me and my constituency i shall talk about that shortly but before doing so i must congratulate all hon members who have made their maiden speeches today because they were all excellent and are a hard act to follow in particular i am delighted to follow the maiden speech made by my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow (rushanara ali) who like me is one of the first muslim women to be elected to this house as we are joined in that achievement by my hon friend the member for bolton south east (yasmin qureshi) i can only remark that muslim women in the commons are rather like buses there are none for ages and then three come along at once my predecessor clare short was very well known for being unafraid to speak her mind when making her maiden speech in 1983 clare said \"i intend to follow tradition and speak about my constituency however it is impossible for me to follow the tradition of not being controversial\" -[ official report 29 june 1983 vol 44 c 623 ]that was a sign of things to come but it was also indicative of her honesty clare had a distinguished career as a labour mp but following differences over the iraq war she ultimately resigned the labour whip in october 2006 choosing to sit as an independent mp she was not the first labour mp from birmingham ladywood to have disagreed with the labour party over policy because our predecessor victor yates who held the seat from 1945 to 1969 had the whip withdrawn from him twice that meant that he too sat as an independent in this house for a period of time this is not a ladywood tradition that i hope to continue but i will strive to emulate the passion and fearlessness of my predecessors in standing up for the people of my constituency in every part of ladywood clare is remembered with pride warmth and gratitude for her hard work and that is the best and most fitting tribute that i can give to this most outspoken of mps i am a brummie born and bred so the fact that i now represent a constituency that is the heart of birmingham is a source of great honour and it is a privilege my constituency consists of four extremely diverse and different wards aston ladywood nechells and soho between them they are home to the grade i-listed aston hall the historic jewellery quarter the star city entertainment complex and the grade ii-listed soho house home of the manufacturer matthew boulton i am also lucky to have both aston villa and birmingham city football clubs in my constituency but as both are in the premier league i will have to learn new skills of football diplomacy when the two sides play each other birmingham ladywood is one of the most multicultural areas in the country more than 50% of our population is non-white and we have a proud multicultural tradition i have been privileged to meet many people from all race and faith backgrounds during my time as a candidate and now as a member of parliament each such meeting has reiterated to me that while the people of my constituency might have come from different places the destination they seek is the same-a place of greater opportunity and the same chance as everyone else to succeed that brings me to why it is so important to me to begin my parliamentary career by speaking in this debate and focusing on the labour market my constituency has the devastating and unwanted distinction of having the highest rate of unemployment in the country our figures for unemployment have been too high for many decades in researching my maiden speech i noted with dismay that unemployment was a theme in the maiden speeches of many of my recent predecessors my constituency is particularly blighted by long-term intergenerational worklessness which is the legacy of previous recessions which devastated my constituency so much that it has never really recovered i was pleased therefore when the labour government announced in december 2007 that \u00a31 5 billion would be provided through the working neighbourhoods fund specifically to tackle the problem of long-term worklessness and allocated more than \u00a3100 million of that money to birmingham i wish that action had been taken earlier in our term in office however i have real concerns about the effectiveness of the working neighbourhoods fund in birmingham where the partnership tasked with delivering the fund is controlled by birmingham city council which has been run by the conservatives and liberal democrats in coalition since 2004 to date the fund has not been adequately used for the express purpose for which it was created by the labour government-to help to reduce unemployment in birmingham's most deprived communities such as my own two facts are evidence of that first mid-way through the three-year programme of the \u00a330 million that had been spent only \u00a32 5 million had actually been spent on projects to tackle worklessness secondly and just as controversially \u00a314 million of working neighbourhoods fund money was diverted to help to bail out the tory-lib dem council's budget overspend on social services i believe that cash for jobs should be spent on jobs and i hope that what is left of that money is spent in the way intended by the labour government-to support the long-term unemployed in areas such as mine in getting the skills and confidence that they need in order to get and retain a job so that they can transform their lives i wish to make a related point on youth unemployment in 1983 clare short warned that school leavers in ladywood in the 1980s faced unemployment not only in ever greater numbers but for ever greater periods of time in 2010 i find myself warning that the children of that generation might be in the same boat because of the new government's plans to cut the future jobs fund that fund created 200 000 jobs and arose from our guarantee of a job or training or a work placement for anyone who was under 25 and out of work for six months i am disappointed that the new government are getting rid of the fund once again a conservative government-this time helped by the liberal democrats-are walking away from the young unemployed in our country i implore them to change course when we damage our young people we damage us all because they are our future if the government walk away from them and break their hearts and spirits they truly will create a broken britain i conclude on a personal note and with a pledge to the people of birmingham ladywood my grandfather came to this country from pakistan in the 1960s he worked long hours on a low wage and made sacrifices so that his family could access greater opportunity he died when i was six years old and did not live to enjoy the fruits of his labour he could not have known that his decisions and his hard work would one day lead to his granddaughter being elected to this house i pay tribute to him and to the successes of the labour party and the labour government who created the opportunities that made my family's journey and that of so many ordinary hard-working families possible i believe that opportunity and the chance to fulfil one's aspirations is the birthright of every one of our citizens and i pledge to the people of birmingham ladywood that i will devote myself to eradicating the misery hopelessness and sheer waste of long-term unemployment so that my constituents can have what they deserve-the same chance to succeed in life as everyone else for however long i am their member of parliament i will never settle for anything less i thank the house for listening "]
