taken part in the debate each speaker has brought their own take and concerns repeating some points but also raising new ones it is a shame as the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn said and where i started my speech that for some reason there is a lack of interest in tragedies that unfold in africa these are human beings and we really need to keep mentioning this in the house we have had a number of debates as the snp frontbench spokesman the hon member for dundee west chris law pointed out and we are frustrated at seeing the situation seemingly get worse in ethiopia\u2014although as the minister confirmed there seems to be some opportunity for progresswill the minister take this back to colleagues as i said in my speech i mean no disrespect to any ministers who are working hard on this but i really think the situation is so serious that our own prime minister should phone prime minister abiy to discuss it the way it is going it could get much worse and then we really would not know how to tackle it so i really think it is urgent enough for the sake of only a phone call to call prime minister abiy and see what can be donei also regret the reduction in international development aid as was also mentioned it is shortsighted and unnecessary and i look to it being restored as quickly as possible we have an impressive record of providing aid to ethiopia\u2014for a while it was our biggest aid recipient now it is second\u2014but i ask that the government do everything they can to urge other countries to contribute to urging peace and in supporting the world food programme by providing sufficient funds for it to help because the potential scale of the problem is unimaginable it has been bad enough in the past but it really is unimaginable partly because of the conflict but also as i mentioned because of the drought affecting not only ethiopia but other countries in the areai thank the minister for his response i look forward to working with him and the minister for africa whom i have engaged with a number of times on this issue i again thank all right hon and hon members for taking part in the debate we are not going away i am glad the minister said that the government will not turn away we have to get this issue sortedquestion put and agreed toresolvedthat this house has considered the humanitarian and political situation in ethiopia", "i beg to movethat this house has considered the humanitarian and political situation in ethiopiagood afternoon mr bone it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship with so much going on in the world\u2014in afghanistan for example and the great concerns over ukraine\u2014problems in africa sometimes get overlooked i remember with some shame the genocide in rwanda in 1994 when an estimated 800000 people were killed while the world including our own country stood and watched we cannot allow that situation to happen again that is why i called this debate so that we can once again highlight the problems emerging from the conflict in ethiopiamany individuals are concerned about what happens in africa i have been chairman of the allparty parliamentary group on ethiopia since 2009 and have taken an interest in the country for a lot longer years ago sir bob geldof asked me \u201cwhat got you interested in ethiopia\u201d and i replied \u201cyou did\u201d sir bob\u2019s amazing work in the mid1980s raised the profile of ethiopia and inevitably drew attention to the problems that the country suffered at that time\u2014potential starvation being the main one at that time the country continued to have political problems due to the continued existence of the marxist dergprior to my first visit to ethiopia in december 2002 i held a debate in the commons only when researching for that debate did i realise just how much else there is to that amazing country in terms of its history and potential for example ethiopia is one of the world\u2019s oldest christian civilisations apart from a brief spell under mussolini it has enjoyed independent status for centuries and has never been colonised it also claims to be the origin of coffee the birthplace of lucy\u2014one of the world\u2019s oldest human beings\u2014and the home of the fabled queen of sheba the spectacular beauty of the country is amazingfor many years ethiopia\u2019s sizeable christian and muslim populations have rightly lived side by side without any problems as have something like 80 tribes with 80 languages albeit from a low base ethiopia\u2019s economic growth has been at a level that we in the western world would envy yes there have been accusations of human rights abuses from time to time with the definition of terrorism sometimes being loosely interpreted the media have not always been entirely free and there have been concerns about the functioning of the democratic process and the demise of the oppositionhowever for a country that has a young democracy the overall situation has been reasonably impressive at least until recently in may 2018 after i had again visited ethiopia abiy ahmed\u2014crucially from an oromo not a tigray background\u2014became prime minister straight away he began doing the right things the longrunning war with ethiopia\u2019s former region eritrea was ended earning abiy the nobel peace prize in 2019 he announced his intentions to liberalise the economy by privatising stateowned enterprises such as ethiopian airlines\u2014an excellent one to travel on by the way political prisoners and journalists were freed from prison and the outlook was brightwhere did it all go wrong in truth street protests and uprisings started before abiy became prime minister on my last visit in april 2018 we were prevented from visiting various areas because of the security situation although it is easy to point the finger at abiy\u2014and we can come back to that\u2014the unrest had emerged before he became prime ministerit is probably too simplistic to say that trouble erupted because abiy came from the oromo tribe and therefore ended the domination of ethiopian politics by the tigrayan tribe which represented just 6 of the country\u2019s population again the situation is more nuanced than that it is probably also too simplistic to blame the outbreak of trouble on the cancellation of elections because of covid in 2020 however it is probably true that the absence of a normal functioning government and oppositionstyle parliamentary process in ethiopia has not helped it is also true albeit it perhaps dangerous to say that ethiopia\u2019s federal style of constitution has led some to believe\u2014wrongly of course\u2014that breaking away would serve certain regions better for example eritrea was once a part of ethiopia but it is no longerone of the fears that many of us have is that the current conflict could lead to a general fragmentation of the country it is very worrying for example that forces from oromia and amhara have been involved in the conflict fragmentation is a real fear even though each region would probably be incapable of any form of successful selfgovernance or comfortable progressive existence for example the establishment of food security safety nets over the last few years\u2014they are being severely tested at the moment\u2014could have happened only through a federal government programme they could not have been achieved by any one region it is important for separatists to realise thatmany of us are also concerned about the possibility that partly aggravated by the massive movement of refugees from ethiopia the conflict will destabilise the entire region\u2014an outcome that none of us wishes to see ethiopia has the unfortunate geographical reality of being neighbour to a number of states that themselves are struggling with various challenges it has to be a worry that some of them might become engaged in this conflict thereby worsening it and the regionhowever such political machinations are far from the minds of those who are suffering because of the current conflict the humanitarian situation in ethiopia particularly in the north is severe", "i am grateful to the hon lady for her intervention which although short raised a number of important points i will come on to one or two of them as i make progress if she will allow me but she is absolutely right to make themon the humanitarian situation the world food programme estimates that 94 million people across tigray amhara and afar are in dire need of humanitarian food assistance as a direct result of the conflict i am very sorry indeed to hear about the situation of the hon lady\u2019s constituents\u2019 families in that particular area that is extremely worrying the number of people in dire need of humanitarian food assistance has increased by 27 million in the last four months alone", "again i am grateful for the intervention i will come to that point but i entirely agree with the hon lady and i thank her for raising iti am told that in addition to the 94 million people in dire need of humanitarian food assistance 400000 tigrayans face famine conditions i am advised that there are more people in that famine situation than in the entire rest of the world which is very very worrying the world food programme briefing states that\u201clifesaving food assistance operations in northern ethiopia are about to grind to a halt because intense fighting has blocked the passage of fuel and food\u201dthere are also claims that the ethiopian government are failing to ensure the safe passage of trucks carrying aid through to tigray partly by not issuing permission for the trucks to make the journeys of course the federal government have also closed off banking services electricity and the internet the situation needs to be addressed urgently the ethiopian government can give permission for trucks to pass through afar and into tigray to deliver some of the aid that is needed  countries across the world need to respond to the general food crisis that the country faces or the harrowing scenes of the mid\u201980s will appear on our television screens once againup to 50 of pregnant and breastfeeding women screened in amhara and tigray were found to be malnourished and the stocks of nutritionally fortified food for these people are now exhausted with further stocks urgently needed the world food programme is calling for an additional us337 million to deliver emergency food assistance in northern ethiopia i very much hope that countries across the world will respondto make matters worse a drought is affecting the region which according to the un means that 26 million people\u2014around a quarter of ethiopia\u2019s population\u2014will require food assistance this year normally the figure is about 6 million or 7 million but this year it is 26 million that together with the fact that humanitarian aid is not getting through to tigray means that ethiopia faces a situation of massive and grave proportions again it is vital that countries respond to the world food programme\u2019s wider appeal for an additional us667 million to help towards that bigger problemon the military conflict human rights watch claims that war crimes are being committed in ethiopia it says that tigrayan forces have executed dozens of people they have captured and that ethiopian federal forces have bombed homes hospitals schools and markets amnesty international claims that troops fighting in support of the federal government have committed widespread rape against ethnic tigrayan women and girls and it further claims that ethiopian and eritrean soldiers are responsible for a pattern of sexual violence in tigray of terrible gravityamnesty international also claims that police in addis ababa arrested and detained hundreds of tigrayans without due process that journalists and media workers were also detained and that hundreds of people were in detention with their whereabouts unknown it is important to point out that the reports suggest that atrocities have been committed by all sides\u2014by the federal government forces tigray people\u2019s liberation front forces and eritrean troops that of course makes it so much worsethe tigray defence forces part of the tplf were within reach of addis before christmas but the forces of the federal government fought back and the tdf have now left afar and amhara and are back in tigray though western tigray is held by ethiopian forces eritrean forces remain there as wellmy recent discussions however suggest a ray of light many people who were detained have been released and it is hoped that there will be a will on both sides at least for discussions about peace that is so important because it would be difficult to address the humanitarian issues that i have outlined if the conflict continues if the conflict continues there will be no winners but millions of losers that cannot benefit anyonei have quoted the work of some charities and organisations and i thank them and many more including officials at the foreign commonwealth and development office and the british embassy for the briefings that they have probably sent all of us i pay tribute to them for their work in ethiopia to try to manage and alleviate  the effects of the crisis sadly a reported 25 humanitarian workers have been killed because of the conflict which is a tragic outcome for people who were only trying to save the lives of others that kind of loss should encourage all of us to do everything we can to helpas i said i have been a friend of ethiopia for a long time i have defended the country in this house and more widely at times when perhaps i should have been more critical over many years i pressed the uk government to increase aid to ethiopia and i was proud when we did i have also visited the country a number of times sometimes however i have found it necessary\u2014as true friends always should\u2014to issue warnings to ethiopia for which i have not always been thanked now is one of those timesi have heard it claimed many times by representatives of ethiopia that the details of the conflict have been twisted by the media and by some international commentators and that reports are exaggerated i have no doubt that competing stories about the conflict are coming out of that country equally however i have no doubt that the situation is perilous and that atrocities have been and continue to be committed by both sides there are far too many reports by independent charities all saying the same thing", "the hon gentleman is absolutely right i was going to suggest that in a minutei stress that i was motivated to hold the debate because i want to see people\u2019s lives saved i want to see ethiopians live in peace and prosper and i want to see ethiopia survive as a country this conflict cannot go on in other words i have held the debate not because i want to criticise ethiopia but because i want to helpi therefore call on the uk government to continue their aid programme and the dialogue that i know they are having with the ethiopian government i call on the international community to respond to the world food programme\u2019s appeal for further financing i call on the united nations to do more to bring about a peaceful and speedy solution to the conflict and on our own government to use our position on the security council to press for more action i call on eritrean troops to leave ethiopia immediatelyi call on both sides in the conflict to accept what we are saying that there will be no winners there will only be losers in the most awful way\u2014through hunger and  possibly famine deteriorating health and further poverty those are not outcomes that anyone would want to see or be prepared to acceptthere should be an immediate ceasefire on both sides accompanied by peace talks that address not only the conflict but the future political situation in the country i also make another request very specifically and because this situation is becoming really terrible i do not make it in any way to undermine the work that the minister and his colleagues are doing i know they are doing a lot nevertheless i call on our prime minister to phone prime minister abiy to discuss how we can reach the peaceful situation that we need to avoid catastrophewe do not want to see another rwanda and we do not want to see a repetition of the balkans conflict we do not want to see those tragedies being repeated so let us act now", "what steps he is taking to help expedite the process of arranging care packages for people waiting to be discharged from hospital and if he will make a

again i asked an urgent question on the issue awhile ago and took part in the debate led by the hon member for rotherham sarah champion as chair of the allparty parliamentary group on ethiopia i thank the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn for introducing this debate and for his continued interest i have spoken with him and have attended debates with him i know he approaches the debate as a friend of ethiopia as does the hon member for rotherhamthe situation is very depressing i am very pleased that the new minister for africa is with us today to reply to the debate all too often we see the media and the world focus on other conflicts understandably perhaps\u2014in syria or the balkans or other areas of the world conflicts in africa tend not to be focused on they tend not to be reported as much as those in other areasi remember feeling ashamed in 1994 of the fact that the world stood back and watched 800000 people killed in rwanda i visited rwanda shortly after i do not want to be too graphic but i walked through the bones of some of the people who had been slaughtered in that terrible conflict the world stood and watched we cannot do that again\u2014we cannot just watch as we see the crisis growing and the tragedies increasing we have heard reports of forces moving through ethiopia towards the capital addis ababa just recently the report produced by the joint investigation team highlights the most horrific crimes that are taking place we have to focus on what is happening\u2014we have to concentrate\u2014so i am glad that this debate is being held today with the minister present but it is not easy to know what to doas i said in my intervention reports are conflicting for the reasons that the right hon member for islington north gave it is very difficult to know exactly what is going on who is to blame or how we stop it happening there is however a growing humanitarian crisis and it is also heading towards an economic crisis the right hon gentleman touched on the problems that ethiopia had in the mid\u201980s since then the country has made  great strides and is far more resilient but millions of people are still dependent on food aid every year that situation is likely to get so much worse the more the conflict growsi have the privilege of being the prime minister\u2019s trade envoy to zambia and angola on my recent travels i have spoken to companies who want to invest in ethiopia they have told me they will not and cannot do that when the conflict is raging\u2014indeed getting worse that situation will make people in ethiopia even poorer than they are now we cannot simply stand by and watch that happenit is difficult to know what to do the right hon gentleman mentioned ethiopia\u2019s past it has a troubled past but also a very proud past as i said in the debate led by the hon member for rotherham sizeable christian and muslim populations have lived peacefully together for many years there are more than 80 tribes and 80 languages in the country which have not in themselves led to problems the country has enjoyed a great deal of peace and economic growth that is the envy of the western world it has so much going for it it is seen as a country with huge potential there is an awful lot in favour of ethiopia and the way it can develop as a country however as we have so often seen\u2014the right hon member for islington north expressed great exasperation and frustration at this\u2014we see the descent into war which cannot benefit anybody even the victors if there are any victors in this conflict will not win overall they will lose too that message must get through to all the players in this conflict in ethiopiai do not have any solutions but i repeat the questions i have asked before could the united nations be doing more i am not an expert on this but is it time for a peacekeeping force to be sent by the united nations  i really do not know the answer to that question but i put it to the minister is that what we should be looking at now before the situation becomes unmanageable could the african union be doing more to bring about peace and a ceasefire in this conflict could more pressure be put on the eritrean government to withdraw any forces they have in tigray as we have heard in previous debates many of the worst atrocities are being laid at the feet of people coming in from eritreacan we somehow find a way to get aid to the people who so desperately need help we often hear people say that we should not be giving aid to countries that are dictatorships\u2014actually we do not but it is important to note that the people in greatest need in the world are those in wartorn countries the secret is to get under the radar and try to help those people as best we canthe right hon member for islington north also mentioned the arms that are getting through to the sides in ethiopia there was a very brief bbc report last night showing what i think were rebel groups who seemed so well armed who on earth is providing arms at such a level to those people that needs to be addressedthis is a deeply worrying situation i do not expect the minister to have any easy answers or to come up with any solutions today all i ask of her\u2014i know she will do it\u2014is to speak to our prime minister and the cabinet to see whether there is more that we can do to try to bring about the ceasefire that the right hon member for islington north correctly called for before this situation becomes an absolute catastropheethiopia is a great country and one i am very proud to be a friend of i have visited it many times and i want to visit again as soon as possible i do not want to see ethiopia disintegrate into an absolute shambles we do not need that there are more than 100 million people in that country and they need some help they need us to do everything we can to help them that is not easy as i say but i know the minister will do everything in her power to raise this matter at the highest levels of government in this country and hopefully we can try to find a way through", "will the right hon gentleman give way", "is the right hon gentleman as confused as i am about the reports of the involvement of eritrean forces there are very strong reports that they are indeed involved and committing some of the worst atrocities but at the same time there is also a denial that they are in that country", "before we begin i encourage members to wear masks when they are not speaking in line with the current guidance from the government and the house of commons commission i

provide briefings and attend meetings regularly on this subject and for his ongoing involvementi asked an urgent question on 14 june and sadly the situation if anything has deteriorated since but it need not be this way as has been alluded to ethiopia is a great country it claims to have been the origin of coffee lucy one of the world\u2019s oldest human beings\u201444 million years\u2014was found there it has been independent for longer than any african country i am not quite sure of the claims about the queen of sheba but i do know that ethiopia is one of the west\u2019s oldest christian civilisations that is one of the tragedies christian and muslim populations sizeable as they are in ethiopia have lived peacefully together more than 80 tribes and probably as many languages have managed to coexist peacefully since the overthrow of the derg in 1992i am told that ethiopia has enjoyed worldrecord growth in the past 15 years certainly it is one of africa\u2019s outstanding success stories in that sense it really is ironic that trouble has flared since the appointment of the outwardlooking modernising prime minister who as has been said won the nobel peace prize for making peace with eritrea after a very longstanding dispute but the rumblings of discontent started before he took office and have sadly increased sinceethiopia has suffered recently because of the unusually warm weather the attack of locusts and of course covid have not helped it is important to recognise that millions of people in ethiopia each year depend on food aid i am really rather struck by what world food programme people have said this week up to 7 million people are in dire need of food assistance in northern ethiopia alone their food stocks in tigray are running perilously low and they need 140 million to expand their northern ethiopian responsei will not go into the details of the conflict which the hon lady covered ably but i will ask a few questions as far as the minister knows has the conflict spread as far as lalibela\u2014a town i visited on my last visit to ethiopia it really would be tragic if it had got that far could the united nations be doing more beyond helping refugees which is a very important thing for it to be doing could the african union be doing more especially in speaking to the tigray people\u2019s liberation front and eritrea to make sure its troops are all withdrawn from the country during the urgent question the minister said he had diverted aid to tigray did that have any effect and if so could that practice be repeatedi also ask that other donors do not turn away from ethiopia because of the conflict people living in wartorn areas are often the most in need i want us to continue with our aid programme we need to target the aid and we need to require transparency if possible we should use it as a lever to bring about peace but we should continue itas a very longstanding friend of ethiopia who has stood in this chamber and the main chamber and defended ethiopia as a friend when perhaps it was questionable to have done so i call on all the parties there to resolve this conflict very quickly and peacefully", "i draw the house\u2019s attention to my entry in the register of members\u2019 financial interests does my hon friend agree that if restrictions are too stringent there is a great danger that people will

grayling on securing this debate because the issue is not talked about as much as it should be it is right that we talk frequently about developing electric vehicles and renewable energy but we do not discuss deforestation enough so i am glad to have this opportunity to make a brief contributionduring the recess i had the pleasure of visiting the eden project which as members know is expertly run by david harland and his team in the constituency of my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay steve double the project clearly demonstrates the importance of rainforests particularly the amazon rainforest in terms of biodiversity insects birds animals plants and perhaps other forms of life that have not been fully discovered very simple research demonstrates that although rainforests cover 6 of the world\u2019s surface they host half of the world\u2019s plant and animal speciesit is also important that rainforests generate so much of the earth\u2019s oxygen given all those facts it really is important that we talk much more about rainforests particularly the amazon rainforest because its deforestation is one of the great crises facing the world we talk about the climate change emergency quite rightly but contributing to that is the rainforest emergency and we need to address the issue urgently the process of deforestation adds to the carbon dioxide emissions that the world suffers fromwe source a number of products from the rainforests but the production of palm oil is perhaps the main issue in encouraging people to deforest palm oil is important to many people including smallscale farmers in developing countries the countries that are causing deforestation are themselves developing the problem is not easy to solve especially as the research shows that growing palm oil substitutes could require even more land this is not an easy problemthe uk has played its part in addressing the problem and moving towards the use of sustainably produced palm oil it has to be a government initiative because although i am certainly in favour of consumer responsibility and putting as many warnings on packaging as we possibly can there are more and more requirements for packaging and it is getting rather crowded which could lead to people ignoring the messages it is up to the government to ensure that what we import is produced sustainablyof course like climate change itself we in the uk cannot solve all the world\u2019s problems but we certainly need to give a lead i am pleased that we are doing that but we have to take the rest of the world with us if these problems are to be solved and we are to protect the planet in the way that we want and need tohelping countries that might otherwise cut down forests and helping those countries that benefit from the importation of cheaply produced palm oil might be a very important role for us to play and it might be a very good use of part of our aid budget as bill gates said\u201cpeople cut down trees not because people are evil they do it when the incentives to cut down trees are stronger than the incentives to leave them alone\u201di might add that they do it when the incentives are also more immediate because if people are starving they are understandably more concerned about that than what they see as some distant concept of climate changefor other products that we source from around the world the fact that we can now negotiate our own trade deals provides us with the opportunity to try to stress to other countries how seriously we take these issues just as negotiators from all developed countries should dothe solutions are not simple an emphasis on sustainability is one way forward the possible development of synthetic palm oil might be another way forward but i really believe that it has to be accompanied by help for others if it is to workwe in the uk have enjoyed relative prosperity since the industrial revolution and we have polluted the planet as we have gone along we need to help others to reach the same level of prosperity without their polluting the planet in the way that we have perhaps i might suggest that that is another reason for us to maintain our aid levels at 07 perhaps this is yet another example of how doing so ultimately benefits the uk as i say we cannot do it all on our own cop26 provides an ideal opportunity for us to set out a structure within which we can lead the world on this issue", "to ask the secretary of state for health and social care what plans he has to promote the nursery milk scheme to eligible recipients to

historical ethiopia is the second largest recipient of uk aid\u2014it receives about \u00a3300 million a year from the uk as chairman of the allparty group on ethiopia and djibouti i wish to see that relationship and that level of aid continuesince the end of the derg in 1991 ethiopia has been a peaceful and safe country holding together very many groups and religions and enjoying impressive economic growth that is why it is so sad to see the current conflict in tigray is the minister satisfied with the current level of engagement of the united nations and the african union in terms of negotiations and peacekeepingthe world food programme has said that 350000 people are suffering from catastrophic levels of hunger categorised as integrated food security phase classification 5\u2014the highest level that is the highest number of people classified in that way in a single country in the past decade and it is projected to increase the world food programme says that it needs an extra 203 million to scale up its response in tigray and that\u201cunless food and livelihood assistance is scaled up\u201dfamine is a risk so what else can we do to helpmore generally is the minister satisfied that aid is reaching people in tigray have the nongovernmental organisations had their access restricted what protection is being provided to aid workers following the reported deaths of nine aid workerson aid does the minister agree that often the people in most need in the world are those living in wartorn countries is it therefore right for any country to be suspending any direct aid to ethiopia at the moment in such situations surely the trick is to get under the radar and deliver aid to the people who need it mosthas the minister been able to assess whether hospitals and their equipment are being adequately protected has he been able to assess the living conditions of the 16 million people who have been displaced throughout the conflictwe have heard about the involvement of the eritreans in ethiopia that was originally denied by the ethiopian government does the minister feel that some of the worst atrocities are being committed from that routefinally what assessment has the minister made of the likelihood of the conflict spreading to other parts of ethiopia and the wider region i know the foreign secretary has a focus on east africa which demonstrates that we are all concerned about that situation", "i too oppose the cut in official development assistance spending from 07 to 05 as we have heard the fact that the percentage is based on the economy means that there is a reduction anyway so the cut can be described only as what used to be known as a double whammy\u2014a hit on some very poor people in the worldin preparation for this debate i asked the ethiopian embassy to give me some thoughts on what the cut means to ethiopia which is the secondlargest beneficiary of uk aid as the chairman of the allparty parliamentary group on ethiopia and djibouti i am very proud of that fact and of what we have achieved in ethiopia the embassy told me that we have improved access to education to primary healthcare and to clean water and resilience  to crises such as famine there we have it education health clean water and food\u2014things that we in this country take for grantedas many people are i am from a very ordinary workingclass background but i never had any problems with food water education or healthcare i was very lucky\u2014we were all very lucky\u2014to be born in this country we did nothing to deserve to be born in this country where we have all those privileges we were extremely lucky millions of people in the world do not have that good fortune i want us to continue to provide those benefits to countries such as ethiopia and to many other countriesit is important that we retain the 07 target because it is not just about cash or money it is a totemic policy that was put in place as a guide and an encouragement to countries around the world so that they too may meet that target we cannot do it all on our own we need other countries to help we cannot tackle climate change all on our own we need other countries to helpi am of course very proud of this country and very proud to be british but we have to recognise that over the past 200 or 300 years we have enjoyed the fruits of the industrial revolution which all started where i come from in the northwest of england we have enjoyed the prosperity that came from that other countries have not enjoyed that prosperity if to tackle climate change we say to those countries \u201cyou can\u2019t do the same as we did\u201d\u2014understandably because we have a world crisis with climate change\u2014we have to help them to get over it that is another reason why we should continue with the 07 targeti supported the coalition government in their attempts to reduce the massive deficit that we had between 2010 and 2015 but nobody in this country will benefit from cutting this \u00a345 billion we have spent upwards of \u00a3300 billion on rescuing the economy because of the covid pandemic that is nobody\u2019s fault\u2014we had to do it nobody in this country will benefit from our saving \u00a345 billion but many many people around the world will suffer if we save that \u00a345 billion i cannot support that policysupporting

mccabe a number of speakers have referred to the need for help for musicians freelancers and indeed theatres i have the roses theatre in my area and i know that help is certainly needed it is needed

of being the cochairman of the allparty parliamentary group on racing and bloodstock and i have cheltenham racecourse one of the greatest racecourses in the world in my constituency i have to stress that it is not a wealthy sport in the best of times at the moment it is suffering very acutely almost 50 of the revenue of racecourses comes from paying customers spectators go every day\u2014it is a sevendayaweek sport\u2014and at the moment they have lost that revenue entirelythere have been a couple of trials and pilots which seemed to go very well so it is really rather disappointing that the government have stopped any further pilots or trials especially given that racecourses are of course vast areas where social distancing would be very easy there are also question marks about why hospitality suites cannot be open when we can all go to a restaurant where there might be 50 or 100 people\u2014again suitably socially distanced why can that not be replicated at a sporting arenaother sports as well not just horse racing are having problems everybody understands why there are restrictions but we have to look at the wider health implications of them sport is a very valuable asset to many people\u2019s lives both physically and mentally and we really have to be careful that in containing the coronavirus disease which we all want to do we do not inadvertently

many colleagues have said that we need to build more houses i am not sure that that is entirely true as a statement in itself because the planning system so far has built very many houses what it has not done is built the kind of houses that young people in particular can afford it has failed in that respect and it has also not built enough houses that older people may want to downsize into thereby freeing up the houses they formerly lived inas was so very eloquently said by my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for the cotswolds sir geoffrey cliftonbrown we are building the wrong kind of housing it is pointless to come to gloucestershire and build more three four or fivebedroom houses all  that does is concrete over green fields and perhaps the green belt\u2014and indeed floodplains in my area which i will come back to in a minute\u2014and create all those extra car journeys and we are still left with the problem we are left with the problem because the wrong kind of houses have been builtof course house building has never\u2014certainly not in living memory\u2014been a free market openended way of going about business there have always been restrictions however when the state does intervene\u2014and i think it is right that the state should intervene in planning\u2014it needs to make sure that it intervenes in the right way we really do need to get away from this idea that having more and more houses therefore makes them more affordable in itself it will not and we have to think beyond just the housing numberswe also have to think about where we are building those houses tomorrow i am visiting an area in my constituency called twigworth just north of gloucester and i am visiting it because very many fields there are flooded that is not unusual in my constituency which has always had a lot of flooding problems the reason for visiting those flooded fields is that there are diggers on them 500 houses are being built on those fields it is ridiculous if we are going to go forward with this algorithm or any other system that insists that my area builds thousands and thousands of houses i have to tell the government that those houses will be built in flood risk areas and on the green belt does that not go against the policies that this government and the party i support also have about protecting such areascouncils as i understand it from the white paper will be given the opportunity to designate certain land as protected but will that protected land take precedence over the housing numbers when they are handed down by the government i do not think that it will as things stand i think that the housing numbers will take precedence that is wrong and it goes against what we stand for as a party we want more affordable houses we have to redefine what \u201caffordable\u201d means and we have to build them in the right places", "to ask the secretary of state for business energy and industrial strategy if he will make

people and they may be killed themselves we have had to think very carefully about the justification of such actions as i say those have been the hardest decisions that i have taken in the houseas we consider this bill it is right to applaud what our armed forces do for us they strive to keep peace they strive to protect us as individuals and they strive to protect the united kingdom as a country in the same way that we have rightly applauded our nhs workers and other vital workers recently it is right to remember what our armed forces have done for us and continue to do for usit is also right to remember that when our armed forces are acting on our behalf they uphold very high standards and that is right the difficulty is that the people they are fighting against do not uphold those very high standards they can be indiscriminate they really do not care who they kill\u2014men women children innocent people that puts our armed forces at a disadvantage it is still probably right that we uphold those standards but it is surely wrong that those soldiers should face vexatious claims many years afterwards when they have been under such tremendous pressurei would say the same about our veterans who served in northern ireland i served as chairman of the select committee on northern ireland affairs for seven years and it greatly troubled me that our armed forces who served there were fighting against an enemy who called it a war they used the term \u201cwar\u201d so that they could excuse their indiscriminate murder of men women and children yet members of our armed forces had to abide by the yellow card\u2014they had to abide by very strict rules it is wrong that they are facing prosecution up to 40 or even 50 years after events and even more of them may face prosecution that is very wrong so i urge the minister to introduce legislation similar to this to cover northern ireland as soon as possible", "to ask the secretary of state for health and social care what recent estimate he has made of the number of covid19 test results which are lost what steps he is taking to reduce that number and if he will make a statement", "the last lockdown which was quite severe did succeed in reducing the spread of the virus but it did not eradicate it what confidence can we have that these measures will actually eradicate it to the extent that we will not be in this chamber in six months\u2019 time discussing further lockdown measures what discussions has the prime minister had with scientists and health experts to find a proper way forward", "what steps he is taking to improve the rehabilitation of offenders on release from prison", "it is a pleasure as always to follow the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson he may well have gone over his five minutes but every word was well worth listening to i will make sure that i stick to five minutesi had the pleasure and honour of chairing the northern ireland affairs committee for seven years and our first report was to encourage the government to explore ways in which corporation tax in northern ireland could be reduced to the levels in the republic so that northern ireland businesses could compete on a level playing field we were told by the european union that it would be against its rules to do that it had to be devolved and the northern ireland assembly had to do it and even then it would be very restricted when it tried to do it such taxation which normally we would claim as our responsibility in this place comes under the state aid rules when we talk about bringing powers over state aid back to this parliament we are not necessarily talking about bailing out lame ducks i am showing my age when i mention that phrase i think it was first used in the early 1970s we are not even just talking about giving boosts to certain parts of the economy we are actually in some cases talking about the control of taxation we are all familiar with the phrase \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d it is very important therefore that the government stand firm on this issuewhen i was working to prepare the committee\u2019s report i said that it was very important to cement the relative peace that had been achieved in northern ireland by having a sound economy obviously one of the best ways to achieve a sound economy is through trade it is therefore very important that we do everything we can to protect trade in the united kingdom and as far as i can make out that is exactly what this bill is trying to do it not only connects the four countries of the united kingdom and paves the way for them to continue to trade with each other very easily it also makes sure that northern ireland can trade as the right hon member for east antrim said with its largest trading partner and that is great britain as i said on second reading northsouth trade is very important but it is not as valuable as eastwest trade or westeast trade that is something we have to be determined to protecti do not anticipate the european union working from a position of bad faith i am sure that it will continue to do everything it can to protect its businesses by coming to a free trade agreement with the united kingdom if we achieve that none of what we are discussing tonight becomes important in case it does not act in good faith however we need an insurance policy so that we can cement the relative peace in northern ireland through prosperity and continue to secure the union of the united kingdom", "as my right hon friend knows sporting venues are suffering financially because of the restrictions and it does not help when planned pilot events are cancelled at the last minute who takes the decisions on whether to allow pilot events to carry on\u2014is it done centrally locally or a combination of both there is a feeling that there is some confusion", "all through the brexit debates and the referendum campaign we were constantly reminded that we should do nothing at all to damage northern ireland and particularly the economy in northern ireland i entirely agree with that advice but as soon as the government try to do something to protect northern ireland and the economy of northern ireland we are told that we are wrongit has been interesting to listen to the speeches tonight members have quite rightly warned that we should not implement the bill\u2019s provisions before it is absolutely necessary the logic of that argument is that they accept that it might under certain circumstances be necessary indeed if one reads beyond the headlines of what was said by david cameron who has been quoted tonight he goes on to say that these provisions should only be used as a last resort therefore accepting that they may have to be used i entirely agree with that\u2014they should only be used as a last resort and the prime minister was clear that that would be the case", "my hon friend is wrong\u2014or perhaps premature i am not quite sure\u2014to elevate me to the privy council but he makes a very good point and leads me on to my next pointalthough northsouth trade is extremely important to northern ireland and indeed to the republic eastwest trade is far more important for both northern ireland and the republic that is not to say that the other is not important of course we should therefore do nothing to damage that tradethe right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson referred to the act of union he did not have time to go into detail but article sixth of the act of union 1800\u2014the very act that created this united kingdom\u2014states that\u201cin all treaties\u201dmade by \u201chis majesty\u201d as it was then his heirs and successors\u201cwith foreign powers the subjects of ireland shall have the same privileges as british subjects\u201dit goes on to refer to manufacturing trade and navigation that act should not be breached it may or may not have the legal status\u2014whatever that is\u2014of a treaty but surely it is an international act of parliament which brought two sovereign nations together that should be respectedarticle 184 of the 2019 withdrawal agreement should be respected when it talks about the need for both sides to operate\u201cin good faith and in full respect of their respective legal orders\u201din other words the united kingdom\u2019s legal order should be respected clause 38 of the european union withdrawal agreement act 2020 asserts that\u201cthe parliament of the united kingdom is sovereign\u201dit is wrong for people to say that ministers will run off with powers and act illegally\u2014they would be given the powers by this parliament if we pass the bill ministers are therefore not running off and acting illegally at all it is important that we deliver the brexit that people voted for i do not want a spat with the european union and i have no reason to believe that it will behave so unreasonably as to deny all eu manufacturers and businesses\u2014the people who send more than \u00a390 billion of exports to this country which is more than we send to them\u2014trading opportunitiesi want a free trade agreement with the european union because that would benefit businesses and people on the continent and in this country it would also remove all the arguments that we are having tonight about the withdrawal agreement and the northern ireland protocol so i really do hope that we can make progress that is the way forward if there is bad faith and if we are put to the test of deciding whether we support the united kingdom or the european union then i remember the oaths that i have given on seven separate occasions in this house and my loyalty will be to the united kingdom", "the foreign secretary has referred to the food crisis in east africa which is indeed acute will he therefore use this first day of the new department to contact potential foreign donors to ask them to up their game i am very appreciative of what our government have done by means of contribution to provide food for people in that part of the world but will he ask other potential international donors to do the same", "to ask the secretary of state for international development what recent assessment she has made of the food security situation in ethiopia and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for international

recently announced support for cultural arts and heritage institutions which body will be responsible for ensuring that small provincial theatres receive that funding and if he will make a statement", "thank you madam deputy speaker i thank and congratulate the hon member for rotherham sarah champion on securing this debate and on her comprehensive speech a year ago i led the very same debate we did not know about the merger then but we did discuss whether dfid should continue as a separate department at that point and i think the view was pretty overwhelming in the house that it should continuei have to say that i have rather mixed feelings about the announcement i understand where the government are coming from and they do indeed want to make sure that british interests are best served with the aid we   provide however as i said to the prime minister when he announced the merger i would argue that poverty reduction programmes across the world are just that it is in the united kingdom\u2019s interests to alleviate poverty across the world for a number of reasons it does reduce economic migration and it does offer increasing export markets for us all of which is in british interests i would also argue that from a humanitarian point of view it is right that we have poverty reduction programmes across the world particularly involving education\u2014especially girls\u2019 education\u2014and health projects all of that is in the world\u2019s interests all of that is in our own british interestswhen the prime minister made his statement he said\u201cit is no use a british diplomat one day going in to see the leader of a country and urging him not to cut the head off his opponent and to do something for democracy in his country if the next day another emanation of the british government is going to arrive with a cheque for \u00a3250 million\u201d\u2014official report 16 june 2020 vol 677 c 675i think everybody would agree with those sentiments but as the hon member for rotherham pointed out the provision of aid is not quite that simple quite often we give aid to charities and nongovernment organisations working in countries i do not think we provide budget support to countries anymore\u2014if i am wrong on that i will be corrected but it is certainly very small if we do the bilateral aid we give amounts to only 63 of our whole budget the remaining 37 is multilateral aid going to things such as the world food programme we do not have the ability to influence evil dictators in the way that we might want to because our focus quite rightly is on poverty reduction as has been pointed out not all the aid is spent by dfid in fact if we add up dfid and foreign office aid it comes to something like 80 with the remainder being spent by other departments merging dfid and the foreign office does not necessarily mean that we have full control over all that moneyan important point i want to make is that countries with the worst types of government often house the world\u2019s poorest people the people in those countries are the neediest and we must not lose sight of that fact i understand where we are coming from we want to provide opportunities for british companies via our aid programmes we want to try to bring about better government across the world and if our aid can do that it is well spent but we must ensure that each department retains the focus that it has had for many years\u2014for the fco diplomacy and its very useful work in other areas and for dfid aid and development i hope that that focus is not lost because people a lot less fortunate than ourselves depend on us", "how can the government help to get more people particularly young people involved in culture and sport of all kinds", "with this it

people were out of their homes for 12 months living in caravans it was a desperately difficult time since then a lot of good work has been done in various parts of my constituency which has certainly helped but nevertheless we have been flooded many times since including in the last week and last novemberi wish to highlight two particular things that i feel really should be done the first is relatively simple we should clear out ditches more regularly and maintain drains better than we are and we ought to consider whether we should dredge all rivers because i understand that that has helped enormously in some areas of the country where it is done we ought to revisit that policy", "i have limited time but i shall give way briefly", "i am grateful for that intervention", "i thank both my hon friends for those interventions with which i agree i must move on quickly because of the shortness of timethe other issue that i wish to raise is house building or any kind of building in flood risk areas it is causing an awful lot of trouble in my constituency the current joint core strategy proposes a 50 increase in the number of houses in the council area where i live not only does that increase mean that greenbelt land is seriously compromised but we have a lot of flood risk areas the building of that number of houses in my area will cause an awful lot of misery for very many peoplei am concerned about our approach to building in flood risk areas the pitt report of some years ago was somewhat compromised it said that yes flood risk areas should be avoided but it also said they should be avoided unless there was a need for a certain number of houses i do not think that that compromise is necessary because when somebody is flooded for more than a year they really do not want to see more development in their areai am rather concerned about how the environment agency makes its assessments it uses maps that in my view are not always accurate\u2014they do not always reflect the flood risk in an area\u2014and it talks about frequencies but the frequencies of flooding have changed with flooding now much more frequent than it used to be who knows where that trend will go in futurewe have heard it said that we do not really build in flood risk areas any more we absolutely do i have shown the secretary of state a photograph of an industrial digger preparing land in my constituency for houses\u2014and the digger is stood in water around 2000 houses are going to be built on that land which is already sodden and far too wet it is a matter not only of whether the houses built on that land will flood but of water displacement\u2014will building on that land cause flooding for people in other areas it is a serious consideration just this week the environment agency said that\u201cit isn\u2019t always possible or practical to prevent all new development in flood risk areas\u201dwell that is going to cause an awful lot of problems for very many peoplewe really ought to revisit the policy i know the driver behind it\u2014i know that this government and successive governments have wanted to provide homes for people  i joined the conservative party during margaret thatcher\u2019s time and one of her great policies was on home ownership with which i entirely agreed home ownership is a fantastic aspiration but we need to be careful about where we build houses building houses for the sake of it will not actually make them more affordable we risk compromising the green belt and building in flood risk areas for no actual benefit to some of the people who are looking to buy housesi referred to the site in my area where an industrial digger is sat in water that is at a place called twigworth and innsworth where permission has been given not by the local council but by the inspector the inspector looked at the application in december 2017 and should have rejected it but the fact that the environment agency did not object to the development did not help everybody who lives in that area knows what a problem it is going to cause i shall name one person who knows what a problem it is going to cause david cameron in february 2014 he visited the area why because the road was completely blocked because of flooding and the fields where the development is now taking place were flooded he declared then that building should not take place in such areas what has gone wrongi pin no blame at all on the new secretary of state\u2014he is brandnew to his position and i wish him well\u2014but i ask him to revisit the existing policy on assessing whether land is suitable for development the surgery that i did at the weekend was very busy full of people coming to complain about overdevelopment i think the one message that they would like me to give to the secretary of state is that we should review the policy before it is too late once we have built on land we cannot unbuild on that land", "my hon friend and neighbour makes a good point back in 2007 it was not only the water that fell in tewkesbury that caused the problem it was also the water that came down from wales i pin no blame at all for that on wales\u2014i would

your state rooms on the occasion of my wedding reception on 7 february 2015 mentioning that leads me seamlessly into thanking rose for her work because she did me the great honour of marrying my wife annie and me on that date in the chapel downstairs\u2014st mary undercroft what a wonderful day it was no one who attended will ever forget it it still gives us strength and fills us with great affection when we look back at it i well remember that i had to be interviewed separately annie had to be interviewed separately and then we had to be interviewed together before rose recommended to the dean of westminster that we should be allowed to be married and it was a wonderful occasion that is my personal recollectionit has also been wonderful to see rose in action over the past 10 years i have attended many services i tend to go to the one at 1245 pm in the chapel downstairs which is immediately after prime minister\u2019s questions and it is a welcome contrast from that experience to hear rose tell us about christianity peace love and how important the way we treat each other is i hope that one of her many legacies as she goes will be for us to remember that how we treat each other is very important personally i will never say anything in this chamber in a tone or in words that i would not say outside it to the person i am talking about or to and i hope that we could all try to do that as we move forward i think the public would really like us to take on the lesson that rose has taught usit hardly seems credible that 25 years ago there was a terrible split in the church of england about whether to ordain women that seems incredible thinking back i was very much on the side of ordaining women because i believe that the person who should get the job is the one who is best qualified and best able to do that job regardless of whether they are a man or a woman i am glad the right side won in that debate because we would have been deprived of the services of rose if  that debate had gone the wrong way many years on when it came to the question of women bishops it was hardly a debate at all\u2014quite rightly\u2014and that has enabled rose to move on to be appointed as the bishop of doveri would like to thank rose for all the enormous work she has done in this place and the messages she has instilled in us about christianity the beliefs and what it means to be christian i would like to wish her all the very best as she goes forward", "may i return to the question asked by my right hon friend the member for north shropshire mr paterson could we

also like to put on record my thanks to my right hon friends the members for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and for witham priti patel and the chairman of the select committee the hon member for liverpool west derby stephen twigg for helping me to prepare for this debate the experience they have and the work they have done is admirablei have long had an interest in international development and i think probably it comes from the fact that i certainly feel very lucky to have been born in this country i did nothing to deserve to be born in this country we have food we have clean water we have medical services and we have education which very many people across the world do not have in other words we have the building blocks to be able to progress in our lives and to normally live beyond childhood while many in the world do not have that opportunityi would go as far as to say that my interest in international development and in trying to help the world\u2019s poorest people was one of my main motivations for wanting to enter the house of commons in the first place and i have had the privilege of being able to witness the effects of the aid that the united kingdom has provided i am aware it goes across the world but my particular interest has been in africa and i have the honour of being chairman of the allparty group on ethiopia and djibouti i have been to some very rural areas in ethiopia as well as the cities and have seen the benefits our aid brings to so very many peoplewe should look at the achievements we have made in this country through our official development assistance fund which is now i am very proud to say 07 of our gross national income we have donated more than \u00a377 billion since 2013 when we set that target", "my hon friend is absolutely right for a prosperous country\u2014we are supposed to be the fifth largest economy in the world\u2014that is a small amount to be asked to pay but it has an enormous impact across the world", "the hon gentleman is right to talk about the crossparty support for this issue in the house the 07 target goes back a very long time and i am pleased that it was a conservativeled government who actually reached it but it would be churlish not to recognise the work that tony blair did for example in highlighting the issue and i am pleased to do so many other leading politicians have also done work on this i am grateful to the hon gentleman for making that point and i will come back to it in just a minutei mentioned the fact that we had given that \u00a377 billion in aid since 2013 but what does that actually mean it means that we have helped more than 1 billion children across the world to get an education as well as helping more than 37 million children to be immunised and more than 40 million people to have access to clean water these are things that we in this country take for granted but our aid has helped people in those ways across the world and i am very proud of that", "i entirely agree with the hon lady on that point i am glad that she has raised it in rural areas in ethiopia i have witnessed situations in which girls have had to walk a number of miles every day to collect water to bring back to their families that is neither sustainable nor efficient it keeps the girls away from school it prevents any progress from being made in the neighbourhood and it is wrong we have to do a lot more to help in those situations i absolutely agree with the hon lady on that of course it is important that boys and girls attend school and there are distractions to keep boys and girls from attending school in such countries but we really have to address that and get over it otherwise we will not make the kind of progress that we want to make", "absolutely the hon lady makes an extremely good and useful intervention as many hon members have done i have seen the disabilities that some children have that prevent them from attending school or from doing very much in life really for example we see children who cannot stand up because their limbs are damaged and children with cataracts who are blind because they cannot get a simple operation that situation really is unacceptable so if our aid can help reduce such incidents it really is worth doing we have to increase aid and we have to improve so muchit is a sad fact that we are one of the only eight countries that actually meet the aid target other countries do give a lot of money but few actually meet the target and we need to work with and encourage others to do so the situation is a bit like reducing emissions in this country because we produce only 2 of the world\u2019s emissions but if other countries are not going to play their part we are not going to get the progress that we need the situation is exactly the same with aid", "absolutely i am sure that madam deputy speaker would not want me to go too far down that road but it is a good point", "my hon friend is absolutely right we could take things even further because in the commercial sense if countries across the world are richer that affords us new markets as well which is in addition to the humanitarian reasons for aid that she rightly outlinesdfid\u2019s budget is around the \u00a314 billion mark while it is certainly a small part of our overall income as was raised earlier it is still a considerable amount of money the aid budget has its critics and criticisms of course and i will come on to one or two of them because some may be valid perhaps we can improve matters and we  should certainly never be satisfied with where we are because we can always do better we all have constituents who point out that some of our schools and our police are short of money so if we are going to spend money abroad helping people who are not from this country then we must ensure that we spend it wisely and effectively and this estimates day debate is about addressing the budget in the wider senseit is worth touching on exactly how aid works this may come as a surprise to some but dfid itself spends around 75 of the aid budget with the other 25 being spent by other departments such as the department for business energy and industrial strategy the foreign and commonwealth office the department for health and social care and the home office and other outside organisations some of the aid that we provide is bilateral and some is multilateral and i will come on to the difference in a minutethe national audit office report which came out just a few days ago says that most of our aid is going to the right places and having a great effect but it did point out that there is room for improvement as i go through one or two areas in which we can improve the observations that i will make are not in any way a criticism of our approach of our aid policy because as the house has heard i am supportive of it", "the hon lady raises a good point i think it was tony blair who set up the separate department which provided it with focus thinking back before that however most right hon and hon members would acknowledge the excellent work carried out by baroness chalker even though the department was then within the foreign and commonwealth officei suppose there are two ways of looking at it when i travel and meet dfid officials abroad i often meet officials from the fco and maybe also from other departments linked to it overall i agree with the hon lady that this is such an important subject and it obviously should have close ties to the foreign office and probably to other departments too as i say 25 of the overseas aid budget is spent by other departments so there has to be a close link i am probably persuaded that that should be the case i will talk to the successful leadership candidate whoever they are about this issue in due coursei mentioned that other departments spend about 25 of the aid budget and that proportion has increased significantly\u2014it was 114 in 2013 that spending can be a good thing because it draws on the expertise of those other departments in certain cases money is  provided that might not have been so quickly forthcoming if those departments had to queue outside the treasury for ithowever the spending raises the question of whether these other departments quite have dfid\u2019s experience and expertise in delivering aid the department of health and social care for example might be expert in handling healthrelated issues\u2014i am sure it is\u2014but dfid has that experience of delivering projects abroad there is a question mark over whether we have got to the right level hopefully the minister will give us some guidance", "the hon gentleman makes a good point and i look forward to hearing whether the minister thinks that 25 of the budget being spent by other departments is about right too high or too low i have not necessarily come with answers i am asking as many questions as i am giving answers but that is the nature of this debatethis spending also raises the question of transparency because the other departments do not have the same legislative requirements for example the international development reporting and transparency act 2006 requires dfid to report to parliament on where the money is spent but other departments are not covered by the actthe targeting of aid is something else that concerns some people in 2017 the last year for which figures are available dfid spent 66 of its bilateral aid budget on the world\u2019s poorest countries but the other departments spent only 25 of their bilateral budgets on the least developed countries there are always explanations and more details behind these figures but on the face of it we need to look at it and ask questionsthrough bilateral aid we have complete control of the projects we fund and through multilateral aid we work with other agencies and do not have the same control and the priorities of those other agencies might be slightly different from ours there are different nuances within each of those headings too this is never a simple subject", "the hon gentleman raises a good point i have not had those discussions with the treasury but they are certainly discussions we will need to have i raise this with the minister to find out her view because this is increasing quite a lot\u2014it has more than doubled in the past few years so the hon gentleman is right to raise the point this is why i make the point about spending in the countries that most need it and targeting it at the poorest people in the world that is what most people would want us to do there can be knockon effects that come to this country but the primary concern must be about helping the world\u2019s poorest people", "i am grateful to my right hon friend for that intervention he has expert knowledge of this issue we had a meeting before this debate and it could have gone on a lot longer because we discussed so very many things where this spending goes does matter and it does matter that there is accountability and transparency that is the important point", "my hon friend raises a good point it is very important to consider the partners we use accusations are made that some of the partners\u2014the intermediaries\u2014might take too big a chunk of the money before that money gets to ground level and there are concerns about that with multilateral aid who we deal with is certainly one of the issues sometimes these bodies do not have the same priorities as we have", "if my hon friend will allow me i will deal with this immediately the bilateral aid of dfid was 626 as against multilateral aid of 374 and this has remained steady over the past few years however  that is still a lot of money going on aid that we do not fully control there are some good projects out there the world food programme is an excellent example of multilateral aid that saves lives the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty mentioned the money going to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and today we had the announcement of this being \u00a3467 million a year as i understand it that is multilateral aid so there are some excellent projects we are involved in but there are delays in reporting by the multilateral agencies which impedes our ability to analyse the work they do", "i absolutely agree with the hon gentleman to whom i pay tribute for all his work in that respect i shall come back to that issue in a momentlet me turn to the independent commission for aid impact which was set up by my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield it has identified some spending by for example\u2014this is only an example and it is not the only one\u2014the newton fund which the commission said\u201cis not promoting the best use of oda and some projects appear not to be within the oda definition\u201dthat is of some concern the commission lists some of the projects about which it is concerned sometimes when one looks into the projects and gets into the details one finds they actually do help people who need help but the headlines that they receive do not necessarily suggest that nevertheless we have to be careful because we all have constituents who want to see that their hardearned money they pay in taxes goes to the right target", "i am grateful to my hon friend for that intervention which enables me to move to another point contrary to what is sometimes said we do not actually finance corrupt dictators in other countries another point raised\u2014i have taken so many interventions that i cannot remember who made it\u2014was that it can be difficult to get aid to the people who need it most  for example people who live in wartorn countries are going to be desperate and will need help of one form or another the people who live in countries with very poor governments that have dictatorships need help it is not the dictator who needs it but the people who live in those countries certainly do need help the trick is to get under the radar to help those people but that should not be confused with the financing of wicked dictators the two situations are different", "the hon gentleman makes a good point of course countries working together has to be the way forward but the system really does have to be accountable transparent and delivered efficiently and effectively when it is those things it is obvious that countries working together is a good thingall that takes me to another point we all want humanitarian assistance to be provided\u2014i certainly do and we certainly do provide it\u2014and it is easy to justify that but we also want to see countries being given the building blocks and facilities to develop the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas gave the example of the civil servants in ghana taxraising and collecting authorities in such countries are important the problem is that it is sometimes difficult to explain to our constituents the difference between development aid as opposed to humanitarian aid it is not always easily understood it is important that we help countries to build the capacity to move forward the old adage about giving a man or woman a fish and feeding them for a day or teaching them how to fish so that they can feed themselves for a lifetime is absolutely right we have to find ways to do that or we will never make the progress in the world that we all want to see", "i totally agree with the hon lady we have had campaigns in this country to get fair milk prices for our farmers so it is certainly right that we  should ensure that farmers and traders in other countries get fair trade as well as fair prices it is very very important indeed", "it is right that we do scrutinise things and that we do demand transparency but it is also right that we put things in perspective as well i certainly agree with the hon member for huddersfieldi want to try to draw my remarks to a close because presumably lots of hon and right hon members wish to speak in summary i want to see an increase in the amounts going to the least developed countries and an increase in transparency certainly in nondfid and multilateral spending i also want us to have a bit more control over and understanding of where the multi lateral aid actually goes we need to be aware that when we leave the european union\u2014and i will say \u201cwhen\u201d\u2014we will get something like 10 of our budget back we then have to decide where that goes i am sure that there is no shortage of places or projects for which we want to providein conclusion i am very proud of our aid budget and of the fact that we have saved and transformed so many lives the suggestions that i have made and the queries that i have raised today in no way challenge my commitment to our aid budget but i want to make sure that we help even more people even more effectively than we already are most people want to see the united kingdom one of the richest countries in the world helping the poorest people in the world but they do have a right to make sure that their hardearned money\u2014it is not our money it is theirs\u2014actually goes to the people who need it the most much of it already does but i think that all of it needs to do so thank you madam deputy speaker for allowing me to speak in this debate",

henry i am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue which is of concern to me personally as well as many of my constituents and the wider public i thank the british veterinary association for campaigning on this issue and its guidance ahead of this debate i declare that i am an honorary member of the bva for which there is no reward other than regular contact which is available to all hon members many constituents have contacted me on this subject including quite a few from the farming communitylike many other people i am a consumer of meat and an animal lover and i do not believe those two positions are mutually exclusive a discussion of the nonstun slaughter of animals must be based not on strength of feeling but on evidence having considered some of the evidence i feel that there is a strong case to be made for the banning of nonstun slaughter the bva believes\u201cthat slaughter without prestunning unnecessarily compromises animal welfare and that animals should be stunned before slaughter\u201d", "i agree with my right hon friend on both of those points i will come on to say more about the former point i suspect that i will be called out of order if i go too far down the latter", "i agree with the hon gentleman\u2019s commentsprestunning renders animals immediately unconscious and insensible to pain before they are slaughtered in the absence of stunning animals can feel the pain of the neck cut experience a delay to loss of consciousness and experience the pain and distress of aspirating blood into the respiratory tract while there is no nice way to end an animal\u2019s life many would agree that that is a particularly distressing account of the last moments of an animal\u2019s life", "my hon friend raises a good and important point i do not pretend for one moment that the practice is absolutely perfect it does need to be improved but the objective should be to go down that road rather than have animals slaughtered without stunning he raises a perfectly good point", "that should not be the case but if it is that practice needs outlawing as well", "i will give way as often as i am requested to do so however i am not yet on my second page i am sure you will agree sir henry that time is limited as this is a halfhour debate and we have already used five minutes i will give way to the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge angela smith then the hon member for ilford south mike gapes and then my hon friend the member for north cornwall scott mann", "that is a good point i will come on to say that all this needs discussing in detail", "that point has been raised with me perhaps the hon gentleman has seen appendix one to the briefing from the bva which gives quite a bit of distressing evidence about the nonstun slaughter of animals let us try to move on", "i agree entirely that may be the compromise we settle on for nowi do accept and understand that this is an emotive and sensitive issue because it can overlap with religious belief however this debate is not about preventing people from practicing their faith i do not want to incorrectly conflate nonstun slaughter with religious slaughterthere are some misconceptions for example many people think that halal meat is all nonstunned it is difficult to get exact figures but i am advised that less than half of halal meat falls under that practice however shechita the jewish religious method of slaughter is solely nonstun i am not concerned about expressions of religious belief though i do think that our beliefs sometimes have to be tempered by the fact that we should not cause another living thing harm when that can be mitigated", "i agree entirely my concerns are therefore completely grounded in animal welfare this topic is just one element of a wider debate we should be having on animal welfare at slaughter including ensuring that the existing animal welfare standards that we have in place are met i hope that we can encourage a sensible debate on this issueas a nation we are increasingly concerned with animal welfare on a broad range of issues and rightly so the government have an excellent record on animal welfare responding to demands for mandatory cctv in slaughter houses addressing plastics in the oceans and tackling the illegal ivory trade today we had a tenminute rule bill on animal sentience that will impose a duty on public bodies to have due regard to the welfare needs of animals as sentient beings when formulating or implementing policy the government are committed to doing that so i ask them to consider some of the things that i am suggestingconsumers are rightly concerned about the quality of life of animals before slaughter as my hon friend the member for clacton giles watling said that also extends to concerns about the ending of animals\u2019 lives which is a concern for farmers across my constituency who feel strongly that the animals they have carefully bred should not suffer unnecessarily in their final minutes i therefore suggest that the government look at banning nonstun slaughter if they feel that the evidence points that way and that it would be appropriate that is a position based on scientific evidence and supported by the bva the federation of veterinarians of europe the farm animal welfare committee and the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals", "i am glad the hon lady excludes me from any suggestion of that if anybody takes up the issue on that basis they are completely wrong and ignorant of the debate\u2014including the reasonable debate we are having in this chamberaction has been taken by several countries whether through a ban clearer labelling or ensuring that production is based on demand slaughter without prestunning has been banned in iceland norway sweden switzerland and denmark other countries such as austria estonia finland and slovakia require postcut stunning immediately after the incision if the animal has not already been stunned", "i agree with my hon friend\u2019s important pointas i was saying a range of approaches are being taken and a ban would not be unprecedented as we have already heard there is considerable support for clearer labelling and for preventing the production of nonstunned meat beyond the needs of our domestic market i ask the government to consider the full range of approaches that has been taken across the world and if they are not prepared to consider a ban to investigate those other options", "i made it clear at the beginning that the debate is about animal welfare and i certainly do not want to suggest what is right and wrong with regard to religion the debate should not be seen as that in any way i have given way an awful lot so i will have to move on a bit i was going to go through the eu law on slaughter which is contained in a council regulation but i will have to speed up otherwise the minister will not have a chance to respondin response to the hon lady\u2019s point as i have mentioned while some slaughter practices do not allow prestunning in accordance with religious rites some halal authorities consider that prestunning is permissible provided that the stun does not kill the animal and that the animal could have theoretically regained consciousness that is an important point because many consumers of meat may not buy it if it is signified as halal because they believe it is from an animal that was not stunned that represents an unnecessary loss to the marketi ask the government to address the evidence being put forward by organisations such as the bva and rspca there have been a number of stark illustrations   which i referred to earlier i will not go through them all again but i am happy to send hon members copies of the bva submission if they would likein the absence of a ban we could move forward in other ways the first way forward is to look at overproduction if nonstun slaughter is to continue i ask that we ensure that supply only meets demand and does not exceed it for example in germany abattoirs are permitted to slaughter animals without stunning only if they show that they have local religious customers for the request to obtain that permission applicants need to fulfil several requirements including on slaughter procedure species and the number of animals i ask that the government take steps to require abattoirs to illustrate levels of demand and issue licences on that basisa second way forward is to ensure that the supply of nonstunned meat is for domestic demand i ask the government to examine export patterns and consider whether the export of nonstunned meat from the uk reflects the intentions of the derogation from eu law again i could give figures on how the export of nonstunned animals has increased considerably over the past few years but time does not permit ita third way forward relates to the important issue of labelling which several hon members have raised it is essential for a number of reasons including the misconceptions that people may have about certain products such as halal and on the basis that consumers have a right to know where their meat comes from how it was reared and how it was slaughtered there is a wider issue about food labelling and many people want the country of origin of food to be labelled more precisely and accurately that can form part of the discussions about labelling", "i agree with my hon friend that it could make a difference i have cut short my speech considerably to allow other hon members to join in which i certainly do not object to doing but i could have provided more evidence for my points if i had had time\u2014never mindthere is a divergence of opinion on the issue so i ask the minister to consider holding a number of roundtable meetings with stakeholders such as religious groups farmers vets and anybody else who has something useful to contribute including perhaps hon members i ask him to engage in the discussions about the process \u2014i am sure he is already taking it seriously\u2014to see whether we can find a way forward no matter what people\u2019s backgrounds religions or anything else they do not want to see the unnecessary suffering of animals i am sure he will engage with the subject and i hope he will get people round a table to talk about it in great detail and see what progress we can make", "to ask the

received a lot more money per pupil but to other rural areas that got much more than gloucestershire didi was very pleased that this government agreed to set up the national funding formula that was good news but we need to start to see the fairness of the formula coming through a bit more quickly if we continue at a very slow pace\u2014let us say that it takes 20 years for there to be an

need to grow the cake which is the point my hon friend correctly makesi want to turn to higher needs funding i welcome the fact that again the department listened to many of us who said that higher

bolstering the bha and perhaps making it more accountable is probably the best way forward", "i certainly do not have a problem with a body overseeing this issue however the bha can suspend a jockey for overuse of the whip\u2014which is about not only disciplining jockeys but the welfare of the horse\u2014and it is also responsible for the integrity of the sport does not the hon gentleman think that those functions fit rather nicely with welfare issues a new body would take away those functions from the bha and isolate the issue when the fact is that other issues also come into play does he understand that point", "i was at aintree when that sad incident took place has my hon friend ever sat on a horse if he has he will know that it is simply not possible to get a horse to do anything it does not want to do", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr wilson i declare my registered interests in that i receive hospitality  from racecourses and racing bodies from time to time and i am cochairman with the hon member for st helens north conor mcginn of the allparty parliamentary racing and bloodstock industries group i very much welcome this debate which gives us the opportunity to discuss how to improve the welfare of racehorses in the united kingdom because i am also the proud member of parliament for tewkesbury which includes the cheltenham racecourse\u2014one of the greatest in the world it generates a lot of income which helps the whole area tewkesbury is a rural area and horses are very much part of the rural scene the petition attracted 313 signatories from tewkesbury demonstrating that there is a love of horses there and a concern that they should be properly looked afteri have a personal interest in this issue my wife owns horses and has done so all her life she trains them and competes not in racing but in other sports i am an animal lover\u2014we keep farm animals as pets and we have had pets all our lives\u2014so i want to see what we can do to build on the good work that has already been done to ensure that racehorses are well cared for not only during their racing careers but afterwardsit will be heartwarming to the bha as i do not always agree with it on everything to hear me say that i believe it is doing a good and improving job of looking after the welfare of racehorses although it is involved in racing it is independent of racecourses jockeys owners and the other racing bodies it does work on the fixture list the integrity of the sport\u2014it makes sure it is clean\u2014and welfare it has a board of 10 members one comes from racecourses and one from another body connected to racing but the majority are independent of those bodies so they can carry out their work completely without bias they investigate jockeys and trainers and sometimes come down very hard on them they have demonstrated their ability to do that as well as their independence", "i will come to that issue in a minute but the hon gentleman makes a very good point everybody in racing wants horses to be protected largely because they love them owners pay a lot of money for racehorses and training fees are some \u00a320000 a year so purely from a financial point of view the last thing they want is for anything bad to happen to their horses that is not what motivates them but they put an awful lot of money into the sportthe hon member for hartlepool mike hill said that racing is a rich industry but those of us who know it know that it is impoverished the top 1 are rich but lots of trainers and jockeys earn very little owners get back an average of 23 of the total cost that is not a return\u2014they lose 77 of everything they put in they do it for the love of the sport and it costs them a lot of money so the last thing they want is for horses to be treated badly on the racecourse or in the stables they simply would not allow that to happena number of charities care for racehorses some of which might have been involved in motivating this petition and the allparty parliamentary group which i have cochaired for a number of years raises money for some of them at a charity dinner in the house of commons retraining of racehorses which is not one that we raise money for does an excellent job of looking after racehorses after they have finished their racing careers greatwood\u2014from memory i think we raised about \u00a350000 for it in this place a few years ago\u2014does great work in bringing retired racehorses together with disadvantaged young people it is unfortunate that that work is not recognised as often as it should beeven people who are not as into racing as me are captured by the excitement particularly that of the big race meetings i mentioned the cheltenham festival but there is also the grand national royal ascot and the derby those races capture the imagination of people not just in this country but across the world who take a great interest in it i have travelled the world to watch racing\u2014i was in france just the other week\u2014and without question british racing is the best in the world although irish racing is also extremely good in this country racing contributes some \u00a335 billion to the economy and \u00a3275 million in tax some 17400 people are directly employed in the industry full time and another 85000 are indirectly employed it really does do a lot for this country particularly in rural areasi am concerned to ensure that we do the absolute best for racehorses so i am not instinctively against having an extra body to look after them but i wonder if it is the best way forward as i have said the bha which is independent of other bodies in racing is doing a good and improving job one of the problems in racing is that there are already too many bodies as well as the bha there is the horsemen\u2019s group the racecourse association the racehorse owners association the professional jockeys association the national trainers federation racecourse groups and probably a few other organisations that i have not remembered i am not convinced therefore that bringing in another body would help and i am not sure to whom it would report or how independent it would actually bethat goes back to the point raised by the right hon member for warley john spellar who asked whether it is not better for people with longstanding expertise in racing and caring for horses to carry out that overview and supervise the work with racehorses i am persuaded that that is probably the best way to continue but that is not to say that improvements cannot be made they have been made over the past few years the number of fallers has on average been reduced the fatality rate has thankfully been reduced and there have been changes to the layout of racecourses to the fences and to whip regulations although those big improvements have been made i emphasise that i am not satisfied with where we are we must continue to move forward and i certainly want to continue working with the bha in order to help it to do so but that is the best way forward rather than creating another bodycheltenham spends hundreds of thousands of pounds a year on veterinary and welfare fees and other racecourses spend an awful lot of money ensuring that the horses are properly checked and fit to run and that there are no problems i accept that there is some way to go but i think that racing is a very clean sport in this country  there are very few examples of drugs being given to horses of any wrongdoing in betting or of race fixing\u2014they all happen very rarely it is a good and clean sport but one that can and should improve and i believe that it is doing soi should like to hear the minister\u2019s opinion my view is that the bha should take the issue forward and perhaps its structure could be altered or it could report more to the government i am not saying that changes are not needed in that respect but i think that is the way forward i am

to secure the future of the united kingdom i speak as a proud unionist and a friend of northern ireland i have had the honour of working closely with people across northern ireland having been chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee for seven years and before that a shadow northern ireland minister for five years interestingly i also cochaired the britishirish parliamentary assembly for some five years we have a lot to fight for in northern irelandthis new clause would provide a guarantee that shows we value the union and recognise the importance of strengthening it but also acknowledge the importance and the value of our most important trading arrangement the uk internal market above all it would contribute to upholding the constitutional integrity of the united kingdom and safeguard the union for the futurenew clause 37 reinforces a view that i am confident is shared on both sides of the house which is that we cannot accept a deal that would allow northern ireland to be considered a separate customs territory from great britain i recognise that this is the view the prime minister has put at the forefront of our negotiations", "of course i completely agree with the hon gentleman although i hope we always do have a unionist prime minister many of us will be working towards that end for many many yearsthe prime minister said in december\u201cthe whole of the united kingdom including northern ireland will leave the eu customs union and the eu single market nothing in the agreement i have reached alters that fundamental fact\u201d\u2014official report 11 december 2017 vol 633 c 27if nothing has changed i am confident\u2014and i understand it is the case\u2014that the government will support this amendmentduring the past two years we have had many polarising debates on our withdrawal from the european union but this amendment is straightforward and should be supported by anyone who values and believes in the union this is not a matter of leave or remain it is about protecting the union and ensuring that any deal we secure with the european union upholds the constitutional integrity of the ukas well as protecting northern ireland\u2019s constitutional position in the uk new clause 37 is also about protecting the economy of northern ireland by securing our most important single market the uk itself there are no absolute figures but estimates from the northern ireland statistics and research agency suggest that external sales of goods and services between northern ireland and the rest of the uk were worth \u00a314 billion in 2016 which represents approximately 58 of northern ireland\u2019s total external sales to jeopardise that by subjecting northern ireland to extra border arrangements effectively down the irish sea would be foolishearlier this year the prime minister rightly rejected the european commission\u2019s proposed version of the backstop which would have treated northern ireland differently from the rest of the united kingdom as the prime minister has said a number of times no uk prime minister could ever agree to it i understand that is still the government\u2019s viewnew clause 37 does not look to tie the government\u2019s hands rather it will galvanise the government\u2019s position on this issue and signal to the people of northern ireland that they will not be left behind or left out the irish border is being used as a red herring by the european union as the prime minister has agreed on a number of occasions we cannot know what arrangements if any will be needed on the border until we know the details of any deal with the european union to think the opposite of that is to put the cart before the horseher majesty\u2019s government the irish government and politicians of all colours in northern ireland have said that they do not want to see a hard border in ireland when we say \u201chard border\u201d we are not talking about troops being stationed along the border\u2014that is not going to happen nor will whatever arrangements we reach with the eu provoke violence along the border\u2014those years have surely gonewhat will happen though is what has been happening for a very long time the two jurisdictions already have different laws different currencies different vat rates different levels of corporation tax different fuel duties different levels of tourism tax and different levels of air passenger duty yet trade takes place people cross the border each day with some people crossing several times a day some checks are carried out at various places in the north and south which is how it will continue to be without the disruption to trade and to everyday life that some people predictthere is therefore no need for discussions about the border in ireland to hold up the wider trade talks with the european union nor is there any need to threaten northern ireland\u2019s position within the uk or northern ireland\u2019s economy during

think i have ever before attended a debate in which i have agreed with every single word that has been said there is such strength of feeling on this issue and that is with speakers from four different political parties and indeed an independent member so the debate has been quite extraordinaryi will quickly pick up on one or two issues mentioned by the minister he acknowledged that the government intervened on the lockerbie and yvonne fletcher tragedies however given that the government accept that libya has been involved with supplying arms and semtex i do not see why they cannot take up the individual cases we have discussed today i cannot see the difference the minister said that a libyan government are not yet in place but we have been told that for a number of years and time is passing so we have to find other ways forward i thank the minister for saying that he will explore other avenues throughout the governmenton the assets we understand the position but the motion asks the government to seek international agreement nobody is suggesting that we should break international law the motion says that we should seek international agreement and cooperation on this issue and i ask the minister to take that back and discuss it with his government colleagues i am pleased that he is taking forward this issue and i thank him very much for his response finally all i would ask is that as far as he can he keeps me and other members informed of the progress he is makingquestion put and agreed toresolvedthat this house calls on the government to take steps to obtain the required international authority to use a proportion of the assets of the libyan government that were frozen in the uk to compensate the relatives of people murdered and injured as a result of libyansponsored ira terrorism and to fund community support programmes in areas affected by that terrorism", "i beg to movethat this house calls on the government to take steps to obtain the required international authority to use a proportion of the assets of the libyan government that were frozen in the uk to compensate the relatives of people murdered and injured as a result of libyansponsored ira terrorism and to fund community support programmes in areas affected by that terrorismi thank the backbench business committee for allocating time for this debate and all right hon and hon members and indeed the minister for attending a debate on a subject that should have been finalised and closed a long time agoduring my time as chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee we had the opportunity of holding an inquiry into her majesty\u2019s government\u2019s support for uk victims of ira attacks that used gaddafisupplied semtex and weapons that was an opportunity not only to hear from the victims of those attacks and the families of those who sadly and tragically lost their lives but to draw attention to a series of missed opportunities to secure compensation for those victims today we call on the government to make amends for the inaction of previous governments by securing justice for those victims and their relatives", "my hon friend makes a very good point as i get deeper into my speech i will refer to other compensation awards but the government should certainly follow that guiding principlethe role of the libyan government in bolstering the activities of the provisional ira should not be understated when he appeared before the select committee the former foreign secretary the right hon jack straw stated\u201cin the 1980s and early 1990s libya was probably the most serious state sponsor of terrorism in the world\u201dthose were very strong words from the early 1970s through to the 1990s the gaddafi regime in libya supplied arms funding training and explosives to the provisional ira which is accepted by many to have both extended and worsened the troublesthrough a series of shipments that took place in the mid1980s the regime supplied the provisional ira with up to 10 tonnes of semtex a highly powerful and  virtually undetectable plastic explosive the semtex supplied made possible a deadly bombing campaign from the late 1980s resulting in a horrific loss of life across northern ireland and the mainland these include the attacks in enniskillen where a bomb was detonated that killed 11 people during a remembrance sunday ceremony the bombings in warrington that resulted in the deaths of two children\u2014tim parry and johnathan ball\u2014and the attack at docklands in this city where a bomb killed two people and injured about 100 more this is to name just a few of the atrocities carried out by the provisional ira using the libyansupplied semtex it does not come close to illustrating the extent of the devastation caused while that loss of life is a tragedy those attacks also had farreaching implications for those who were injured and for the families and loved ones of those who sadly lost their livesduring our inquiry many victims emphasised not only the physical effects of the attacks but the emotional psychological and financial difficulties caused the testimonies of those victims have been highlighted in previous debates but it would be valuable to the house to consider them once more to illustrate the sheer loss heartache and pain caused by those attackscolin parry whose 12yearold son tim died following the warrington bombings in 1993 told the committee\u201cdescribing the final moments of your child\u2019s life is beyond words\u2026because as a parent there is no greater pain or loss than the death of your child\u201dsuzanne dodd\u2019s father was the inspector on duty on the day of the harrods bombing she told the committee that on the day of the attack she and her siblings had been waiting for their father to come home to put up the christmas tree when their mother told them that there had been a bomb at harrods and that their father would be late it emerged that her father had been seriously injured her mother returned from hospital on christmas eve telling suzanne and her siblings that her father had diedthe urgency of this issue is possibly best illustrated by mrs gemma berezzag whose husband was left blind paralysed and brain damaged by the docklands bombing for 20 years she cared for her husband\u2019s complex needs on a daily basis she sadly passed away in 2016 before any resolution could be found i ask the government how many more individuals affected by those atrocities will not see justice in their lifetime those cases provide only a snapshot of the suffering caused by libyansponsored ira terrorism and time is running out for many of the victimslosing any loved one through natural causes is bad enough losing someone through an accident is perhaps even more shocking but how much worse must it be when that life has been deliberately taken through terrorism add to that grief the involvement of a foreign rogue state and the victims\u2019 relatives and friends must suffer more than any of us could ever imaginethe northern ireland affairs committee heard how victims have been repeatedly let down by successive labour conservative and coalition governments owing to their failure adequately to pursue compensation on their behalf at times it seemed that during periods of improved relations the concerns of victims were secondary to other considerations the committee concluded that  there had been a series of missed opportunities to raise the issue of compensation particularly during a period of deepening relations between the uk and libya in the 2000s", "the hon lady is a valuable and active member of the committee and she took part in the inquiry to which i refer i will touch on the issue she raised in a moment because it is a very important pointin the 2000s compensation was secured for the families of the lockerbie bombing victims and in 2004 we had the first visit to libya by a british prime minister for 60 years that visit was accompanied by the announcement that shell had signed an agreement worth up to \u00a3550 million for gas exploration rights off the coast of libya yet there was still no sign of compensation for these victims for our inquiry the extent to which the government of the day were aware of the campaign to seek compensation is unclear nevertheless i believe the uk government missed a vital opportunity during this period of improved relations to act on behalf of ira victimsthe situation is even more disheartening for victims when we look to the achievements of the us french and german governments in securing compensation for their citizens because of the french government\u2019s threat to veto the lifting of un sanctions on libya libya agreed to pay the french government 170 million in respect of the 170 people killed following the bombing of uta flight 772 in 1989the committee also examined the exclusion of the uk victims of gaddafisponsored terrorism from the terms of the uslibya claim settlement agreement in 2008 as another missed opportunity for uk victims although the then uk government claimed they had made representations to the us for the victims\u2019 inclusion we received no evidence of the level at which they had been made and with what force it was explained that the us was unable to include uk victims in the agreement for several legal reasons including that neither international law nor us law allows the us to espouse the claims of foreign nationals however this was contested during committee evidence sessions when it was suggested that that was not a matter of law but rather a matter of us government policy my primary concern however is the actions of the uk government and i do not believe that on the two occasions i have outlined enough was done to put forward the claims of victimsas the gaddafi regime crumbled in 2011 the un imposed financial sanctions on several individuals and entities involved in or complicit in the commission of human rights abuses in libya in september 2017 it was established that \u00a312 billion of assets from the gaddafi regime remained frozen within the uk\u2019s jurisdiction currently the un resolutions and the eu regulation which enforces them in the uk provide no option for the uk government to use frozen libyan assets for the purposes of compensation disappointingly there is no evidence that the uk government raised the issue of  compensation at the point when the assets were frozen this is particularly frustrating as there are precedents for the use of frozen assets to compensate victims for example 225 million of former president marcos\u2019s assets seized in swiss bank accounts have provided reparations for victims of human rights abuses in the philippinesthe select committee asked the government to consider the use of frozen assets to compensate victims and to contribute towards community support at the time we were very disappointed by the government\u2019s rejection of recommendations made and a number of members including myself and the new chairman of the select committee have continued to engage with the foreign secretary on this issue however to date the government have unequivocally ruled out the use of these assets for compensation and the potential use of our veto at the un security council for the purpose of securing compensation today we ask that the government take a fresh approach to this issue and explore all options available to acquire the international authority to use a proportion of the libyan assets frozen in this country to compensate victims and to set up support projects in the communities affectedi do of course recognise that there are victims of gaddafi in libya as well as in the uk and i emphasise that the assets i refer to are the assets of those involved in human rights abuses in libya and not those of innocent libyans the funds seized and frozen in this jurisdiction and across others have a role to play in contributing to the rebuilding of libyan society and in helping the people who have suffered there to rebuild their lives however there is still a responsibility to deal with the legacy of the gaddafi government and the pain and suffering caused in the uk i believe we should pursue these funds in order to do soi am realistic and recognise that since the fall of the gaddafi regime libya has faced insecurity and political instability which has hindered progress on a number of issues including compensation i welcome the fact that when the foreign secretary visited tripoli in may and august last year he raised this issue with the prime minister to reply to the intervention from the hon member for north down lady hermon i understand that that is the extent of what happened although the minister may correct me on that i hope that this issue will continue to feature in the discussions that the government have with the libyan government i ask the government to pursue this governmenttogovernment approach where possible rather than viewing this as a matter for individuals to deal with themselves they simply cannot do so the continued perseverance of the victims and their families shows strength and resolve but they should not have to pursue this very difficult issue alone and i ask the government for their support in thatwhen conducting our inquiry we were repeatedly told by ministers that it was difficult to move this issue on because there was no functioning government in libya to deal with and as soon as one were established a more determined approach would be taken however that has not happened and the relatives have suffered for too long that is why supported by many hon members we are suggesting today that the government assess the origin of the frozen assets to determine how much of them were effectively lodged by the then libyan  government as opposed to being investments made by private individuals we suggest that the government then seek international permission to use those assets to compensate the victims of libyansponsored ira terrorism to compensate their relatives and to

favourite margaret thatcher policies was that on home ownership she extended home ownership to so many people who previously would not have had the chance to own their  own home i am absolutely with the minister and the government in their desire to increase the number and percentage of people who own their own homei am pleased that the minister recognised that housing supply is not the one silver bullet indeed there is no silver bullet i stress that the building of more and more and more houses will not necessarily lead to greater affordability there is not an easy answer but we must work even harder to make sure that we achieve what i think all members wanti certainly will contribute to the discussions on the planning guidance i ask for further clarification however on the green belt and unmet housing need as i said earlier the government have stated in planning guidance in the past that unmet housing need is unlikely to outweigh harm to the green belt in importance the government must be a little clearer on that as we move forward", "i am pleased to see the minister nodding to my request on that pointagain i thank all members for contributing to this interesting and

thank the backbench business committee for allocating time for this debate and the minister for attending he is a new minister so i absolve him of all blame and i wish him well in his new role i look forward to working with him constructively on the issues that i am about to raise i also thank the 33 hon members who supported me in obtaining this debate it demonstrates how much interest there is in the subjecti have chosen three topics for debate housing planning and the green belt i have long had an interest in these areas\u2014protecting the countryside was one of my motivations for entering parliament in the first place\u2014but my interest and concern have been heightened by my constituency experiences so although this debate is not about my area entirely i will seek to offer examples from tewkesbury to illustrate my points i know that other hon members will feel free to do similarlyas with most things in life we must always seek to find a balance in this instance we must ensure that everyone has a decent home to live in while also recognising that we are not the owners but merely the custodians of the countryside who have a duty to pass it on intact so that future generations can enjoy all that it has to afford in the same way as past generations i fear however that we are in danger of failing to achieve that balancelet me begin with housing this government like previous governments have committed themselves to building more houses in order to address the socalled housing crisis and as reflected in the name of the most recent housing white paper to fix the \u201cbroken housing market\u201d i want to challenge or at least put in context the government\u2019s characterisation of this crisis i also want to ask whether it is accepted that what is happening in london and possibly in the wider southeast is somewhat different from what is happening in many other parts of the countryi am concerned about what seems to be a belief that supply is the sole answer to the socalled housing crisis i believe that there are several factors at play and i shall say more about that later i would argue that the issue is not the availability of housing as such but its affordability even with that in mind however i am not convinced that increasing supply will substantially drive down costs i have done some research on the matter according to evidence given to the redfern review by oxford economics supply is unlikely to bring house prices down except in the very long term even boosting uk housing supply to 310000 homes per annum brings only a 5 fall in the baseline forecast of house pricesi think that we need to look beyond the issue of building more houses to what sort of houses we are building as i will explain later the planning system is  producing four and fivebedroom houses which are often out of the price range of firsttime buyers when what we need are twobedroom houses bungalows for older people and housing that is accessible to people with disabilitiesthere is no doubt that housing in london is very expensive and london has that in common with major cities across the world hotels are also expensive in london as they are in paris new york tokyo hong kong and many other international cities however that is not necessarily because there is a shortage of houses or hotels it could be said that the uk would be better served not by attracting more and more people to live and work in london but by spreading the wealthcreating sector and financial opportunities across the country rather than allowing london to act as a magnet members should not get me wrong\u2014london is a fantastic city probably the greatest city in the world and i want to do nothing to diminish its status\u2014but we should not think that what is happening in london must automatically shape policies across the uk because sometimes the problems are differentthe government seem to be describing the housing situation as broken and in crisis on the basis of their analysis of the fall in property ownership among young people and there has indeed been such a fall home ownership among 25 to 34yearolds has fallen from 59 just over a decade ago to 37 today moreover house building has fallen by 40 since the 1980s i recognise that there are problems in the housing market but again to reduce them to an issue of supply is an oversimplificationmy analysis suggests that the falls in ownership and house building have in large part been caused by the crash in 200708 and the financial fallout from it before 2007 we were living in an artificial financial boom personal debt was increasing and some companies were offering applicants mortgages that were worth up to 125 of the value of the houses that they were seeking to buy selfcertification of income also still existed all that changed with the crash mortgage applicants then had to provide documentary evidence of income and while the fall in interest rates should have helped buyers the affordability of a house was assessed not at the prevailing mortgage rate at the time but at an assumed rate that would be reached should interest rates be increasedfor example at the moment the standard mortgage rate is 45 and there are many better offers than that available but applicants are assessed on the basis of whether they could afford to pay their mortgages if rates reached 6 or 65 as was the case 40 years ago significant deposits are now required by lenders before they will release the mortgage that has brought about a very significant changei am not saying that the government\u2019s insistence on stronger capital bases for banks is a bad thing nor is such a requirement a tightening up of lending practice what i am saying is that it has had a significant impact on the ability of young people to buy their first houses the fall in ownership particularly among young people and the fall in the number of new constructions did not come about because of a change in planning guidance in 200708 because there was no such change these falls came about because of the change in the financial  position of banks and building societies we therefore have to be careful that we do not respond to a change in lending practice with an easing of planning regulationwe also need to recognise that at the same time as describing the housing market as in crisis and broken the government have set up an inquiry into why developers land bank which is something of a contradictory position estimates suggest that 320000 homes granted planning permission over the past five years have not been built in my constituency i have seen developers having to obtain an extension to their planning permission because they have reached the end of the statutory fiveyear period before starting to build developers will not deny themselves the profits that would come from building on land for which they have planning permission without good reason so perhaps we ought to consider that they might be failing to develop the land because there is not quite the demand for housing in some areas that is assumedthe determination to build ever more houses has led to some councils being persuaded that they need to build on the green belt in order to meet what is assumed to be their assessed housing need that points to a confusion and contradiction in greenbelt policy the government\u2019s planning guidance states that the green belt should not be developed other than in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d yet it fails to describe what constitutes \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d the housing white paper goes on to say\u201cgreen belt boundaries should be amended only in exceptional circumstances when local authorities can demonstrate that they have fully examined all other reasonable options for meeting their identified housing requirements\u201dhowever crucially for the point i am making planning guidance also says\u201cunmet housing need\u2026is unlikely to outweigh the harm to the green belt and other harm to constitute the \u2018very special circumstances\u2019 justifying inappropriate development on a site within the green belt\u201dplanning guidance is going around in circles because in effect it says that the green belt should not be built on unless nowhere else can be found to build the houses but that unmet housing need is unlikely to outweigh harm to the green belt in importancethis confusion and contradiction in planning guidance along with the assumption that we have a housing crisis across the whole country has led to proposals to build around 10000 houses in my constituency on greenbelt land including 1000 on land which floods indeed in 2014 the then prime minister david cameron visited my area to look at those very fields that were flooded as well as the roads and some houses i can assure the house that he did not visit to look at dry green fields yet permission has been granted on appeal to build on that very land", "the hon gentleman makes an important point i am hoping that the housing white paper to which i will return in a minute will attempt to clarify matters as he will be aware a lot of planning applications are assessed against the fiveyear land supply particularly on appeal but there is no methodology for calculating that fiveyear land supply that is another problem in the planning system that i hope the government will be able to correct", "i am grateful to my right hon friend and gloucestershire neighbour that is exactly the point that i was seeking to makewhy are there so many proposals to build houses on the green belt particularly in my area in the joint core strategy that is being drawn up by the tewkesbury cheltenham and gloucester planning authorities tewkesbury is looking to cover the unmet need of cheltenham and gloucester however contrary to planning guidance the green belt is being compromised in order to satisfy the undoubted duty to cooperate and this is creating confusionwhy is tewkesbury borough council doing this it is because it feels that it must and i have some sympathy with its position when i read the details of the planning inspector\u2019s report which again illustrates anomalies in the planning guidance the inspector states in her report\u201ctaking full account of constraints and the outcomes of crossborder exploration removal of land from the green belt is needed so far as is justified to contribute to housing provision and the fiveyear supply\u201dshe goes on to say\u201ci find that the adverse impacts of removing land from the green belt would not significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of contributing towards housing and other development needs\u201dhere we see clear evidence of the confusion in the planning guidance with regard to protection of the green belt the inspector is insisting on building on the green belt and on the floodplain in order to meet housing numbers yet the planning guidance clearly states that unmet housing need is unlikely to outweigh harm to the green belt in importance i am aware that local planning authorities have the right to change the designation of the green belt at the planmaking stage but that is not the point the point is that there is a contradiction in the planning guidancei am aware that the government have introduced a white paper to consider the housing crisis and the broken housing market but having read through it i do not think that it is likely to address the problems of the market or the inconsistencies contradictions and confusions in the planning system nor do i think that it will restore a sense of democracy to the planning process  indeed the wishes of a significant proportion of my constituents have been completely disregarded in the outcome of this process we often hear the government referring to the importance of local decision making but the existence of the planning inspectorate makes a mockery of that and does not help us to provide the houses that we need", "i am not familiar with the situation in my right hon friend\u2019s area but i know that the appeals system does not seem to work to the benefit of local communities", "i am grateful to the hon lady for her intervention and i welcome her supportguidance on the provision of affordable housing requires councils to assess the need based on local circumstances but such housing is not being delivered in practice the housing white paper outlines that that the government intend to amend the policy framework to introduce a clear policy expectation that housing sites deliver a minimum of 10 affordable homes but that is not sufficient to address the issues that the planning system is failing to sort out particularly for firsttime buyers as i see it it will still be producing the wrong types of housing\u2014perhaps large threebedroom houses but also four and fivebedroom houses\u2014when many areas including my own need affordable twobedroom houses such homes are more likely to be within the price range of younger people thereby addressing the problem that the government identified in the first place a fall in ownership among young people", "i was not aware of that figure so i thank the hon gentleman for that helpful interventioni was speaking about home ownership among young people but the provision of twobedroom houses would also help older people who are perhaps looking to downsize after retirement which would free up larger houses yet that is not happening at the moment", "i thank the hon lady for her intervention the minister is here and listening to all these points which i am pleased to say are consistent with my speech however i am being glared at by madam deputy speaker because i have spoken for longer than i had intended so i will wind up my remarksi will conclude with the following suggestions the government should accept that london\u2019s housing issues are not the same as those facing the rest of the country that affordability and a change in lending practice is a significant factor in falling ownership levels among young people and that merely increasing the supply of houses will not address that we need to ensure that more affordable houses are built for both younger and older people planning guidance for greenbelt land is confused and needs clarifying decisions by the planning inspectorate often do not reflect government policy or planning guidance and its existence is an affront to democracy in itself the housing white paper needs revisiting to ensure that we build the right houses in the right places to give the younger generation a real prospect of being homeowners while also protecting the countryside madam deputy speaker thank you for the time today

expedite such arrangements as quickly as possible", "exchair", "i too welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker and very much look forward to working with you in the house i also welcome the minister to her new post and wish her well in the roleit is a little unfortunate that this is the second time this week that we have had to discuss northern ireland matters in this respect because of course on monday we had a statement from my right hon friend the secretary of state to update us on where the discussions are with regard to bringing the parties in northern ireland together to restore the assembly and the executive and unfortunately it was not good news we wish him well in those negotiations because as has been said already today decisions that affect northern ireland should be taken in northern ireland by local politicians elected by the people we hope that progress will be made i was a shadow northern ireland office minister for a number of years and we dealt with many important issues upstairs in committee perhaps with as few as 18 mps only a fraction of whom were from northern ireland that was no way to run the province so i really do hope that those negotiations and discussions can move forwardit is also unfortunate that we have to renew this legislation when i was a shadow minister we held these discussions and found it necessary to extend the period of time in which we could have nonjury trials none of us wants that to be the case one of the central tenets of united kingdom law is that we are tried by our peers\u2014those we work with and live alongside\u2014in a jury that is the way it should be so it is unfortunate that we have to extend this facility today however as i understand it and as the hon member for north down lady hermon has mentioned section 44 of the criminal justice act 2003 which allows nonjury trials to take place applies across great britain i have not looked at it in great detail so i am not sure how that provision differs from the measures we have in place in northern ireland i am not sure whether there is any opportunity to roll the two into one provision at some future point because even though we have special circumstances in northern ireland obviously we seem to have them in great britain as well as the existence of the 2003 provision shows it is always regrettable when we get to that pointwhere is the specific threat perceived to be coming from the minister has quite rightly said that a very small fraction of cases are tried in this way but it would be interesting to know what kinds of offences they were if she does not have that information available immediately perhaps she could write to hon members who are interested what sort of cases are tried in this way are there any particular offences is there a pattern this point was raised also by the hon member for north down it is important to try to identify where the problem isit is not all bad news in northern ireland i have touched on two pieces of bad news but the secretary of  state also mentioned on monday that he is reviewing political donations which he wants to be more transparent when i chaired the select committee on northern ireland affairs in the last parliament we looked at that matter and urged a move in that direction because we want to make northern ireland politics more normal that was some good news today\u2019s news\u2014that we have to extend this measure\u2014is not good news but i have no hesitation in supporting the governmentwhen we looked at this issue previously we asked whether a single judge sits on the nonjury trials or whether there are any occasions when more than one judge sits i seem to remember being told that one judge usually sat on such cases because of the limited number of judges available but given that the minister suggested that only a small number of cases are tried in this way is it not possible for more than one judge to preside over such casesit is with a heavy heart that we have to extend this legislation but i support the government in doing so for the reasons that have been given i hope that we can continue to move forward to the point at which it is not necessary to make this the norm and where we do not need this kind of legislation on the statute book because northern ireland will have moved to where we want it to be it is sadly not there yet for the reasons that the minister set out but i wish her well in that respect", "sir david it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanshipi congratulate my hon friend the member for st ives derek thomas and thank him for securing and introducing this very important debate horses are very important to me horses brought my wife and me together many years ago and i have ridden many many times i therefore know that horses as well as being very big and powerful are very nervous and volatile and consequently very unpredictable that is a big part of this debatei also have an interest in the debate as i used to be the chairman of the allparty group for the horse and currently serve as the joint chairman of the allparty racing and bloodstock industries group and i draw the house\u2019s attention to my entry in that respect in the register of members\u2019 financial interests it is very important that we understand that there are very many horses in this countryi agree with my hon friend the member for cheltenham alex chalk that this is not just a rural issue there are many horses in london for example as well as in cheltenham i am very fortunate that the cheltenham racecourse falls within my constituency not his\u2014nevertheless he is very supportive indeed my point is that there are very many horses around our towns and cities and in particular around our country roadsi want to pick up on one point made by my hon friend the member for st ives speed on rural roads i myself have been involved in a car accident because someone was driving down a narrow country lane so fast they could not stop\u2014i had stopped and they ran into me if it had been a horse in that position there could have been a serious accident only some four weeks ago during the general election campaign i was called away from campaigning to another similar accident down a very narrow lane where someone was again going so fast they could not stop i do not know whether the car they hit was a writeoff but it certainly looked that way i do not know what the speed limit for that country lane technically was but as has been suggested surely the important thing is that people drive according to the road conditions rather than any arbitrary speed limit i urge the minister to consider that serious issue and to review the situation", "i am grateful for that intervention even 40 miles an hour on the wrong kind of road could be too quick this goes back to what my hon friend the member for south east cornwall mrs murray said about education being very important in connection with horses but also with driving safely according to the road conditions it is often not possible to go faster than 10 or 15 miles an hour on a very narrow country lane to remain safe so education is crucialmy final point is that in order perhaps to take horses off roads that might be dangerous we could do with reviewing the rules on bridleways it might be that many existing footpaths could be made dual use and function as bridleways as well that would help to ease the problem", "i entirely agree with my right hon friend\u2019s remarks i will not take up any more of the house\u2019s time except to stress that horses are part of our countryside and our country we only have to look at the startling statistics that have been cited to realise that we really must do something about the issue", "to ask the

parliament is there that is the point", "i join the secretary of state in his condemnation of the actions taken yesterday which were another attempt to kill innocent men women and children that is totally unacceptable in any part of the world for it to continue in the united kingdom is abhorrent to all rightthinking people i congratulate the secretary of state on the work he has done over the past few weeks which to him probably seems like months he has done his utmost to bring the parties in northern ireland together to get the institutions up and running again i thank him for keeping in touch with me as chairman of the select committee that has been very useful so i thank him i wish him well in his future discussionsi pay tribute to the hon member for blaydon mr anderson for his performance over many many years in this house he has worked here for many years and i was very sorry to hear that he will not be seeking reelection to parliament he was a longstanding very active and extremely good member of the select committee for many years before he took up his present position i can confirm that he is a tough negotiator but he is a fair man and it was a great pleasure to work with him i wish him well for the futureit is unfortunate that we have to be here yet again to discuss these matters and it is unfortunate that the rates have to be set from this place it is not entirely democratic and it is not in any way satisfactory that following an election with a high turnout of voters we end up taking decisions here in this place that should rightly be taken in northern ireland unfortunately it is worse than that because that is just a microcosm of a bigger situation i know that many individuals and businesses in northern ireland see the breaking down of the institutions as a distraction from what they want to do only last week i had a meeting with representatives of a business that wants to expand and bring potentially hundreds of jobs to northern ireland they do not know where they are they do not know what the position is they do not know how the planning process will work because it is a large application they really do regret the present situation it is not one in which any of us want to find ourselves but here we are againi am glad that the secretary of state outlined the options he did not actually use the words \u201cdirect rule\u201d but that is obviously what we will be sliding towards if no agreement cannot be secured and we cannot get the institutions up and running in northern ireland i do not want that to happen what i do want to happen is for instance the addressing of the concerns that that company raised with me last week i want the company to be able to create those jobs in northern ireland without the distraction of election upon election upon election and the making of decisions in a piecemeal way that is not what people of that kind wanti was in northern ireland a couple of weeks ago on a social visit speaking to friends there they are catholics which is an important factor because of what i am about to say they said to me \u201cfor goodness\u2019 sake laurence get on with it and bring back direct rule because that is only way we will see any decisions made\u201d they do not particularly want direct rule\u2014most people probably do not want it\u2014but if it comes to a choice between chaos and direct rule people will go for direct rule they will have toit is unfortunate that we have reached such a position but let me say to those who are likely to bring about that situation\u2014and they are not i believe those who are in the chamber today but those who refuse to take their seats in the chamber\u2014that it would be rather paradoxical and strange that the one party that says that it does not want rule from this place should be the party that will bring it about how odd will that beif those people are listening let me inform them of what direct rule really means i was a shadow minister when we had direct rule in previous parliaments and it does not mean that everything is decided in the chamber it does not work like that there are committees upstairs with 20 or so members\u2014handpicked by the whips let us be honest about that very few of those members would be from northern ireland because of the mathematics involved important matters are decided in those committees that is the reality of direct rule i would ask those who are getting in the way of the institutions\u2019 being set up again \u201cis that how you want northern ireland to be governed\u201d", "that is a very good point i genuinely do not know what their logic is as i have said theirs is the party that shouts the loudest about its opposition to british rule as they call it yet theirs seems to me to be the party that will shortly bring it about as i have also said i do not want us to go down that road and there is still time to avoid itthat takes me to my next point which is about powersharing i think that those on all sides if they sign up to powersharing must accept what that means it means working with people whom you do not necessarily like it means working with people with whom you do not necessarily want to work it means compromising on certain policies you do not always get the exact policy that you want come to think of it i suppose that every political party is like that we all have discussions within political parties we all have disagreements on policy within political parties we all have to work within political parties with people with whom perhaps we do not want to work that is the reality of politics in fact that is the reality of many jobs people who work in companies have to work with people whom they do not like they have to work on policies which are set by management and with which they may not agree that is the nature of work if people are not prepared to accept compromises\u2014if they are going to run away every time there is a difference of opinion and take the ball home and bring the institutions down\u2014the system simply will not work i think that all parties\u2014i am not talking about just one party\u2014must accept that", "it is a pleasure to work with the hon gentleman on the select committee as well and he brings a great deal of calm and common sense to it i fully understand what he says and i am not saying that that should be brushed under the carpet but i do not see why an inquiry could not have been carried out with the then first minister still in place to risk bringing all the institutions down is\u2014on any issue to be honest\u2014not worth it i think this is a big issue it is worth half a billion pounds over 20 years but i do not think it is a big enough issue to bring the institutions down", "the right hon gentleman raises an important point and it goes back to the point i was trying to make earlier we either accept that we have to work with people we do not like and do not want to work with or we do not and if we do not accept that there is no power sharing it is as simple as thati am afraid it is a very good point that parties on both sides have had to work with people they do not want to work with there are accusations about certain members of the assembly and if they were in this place and we had to work very closely with them maybe we would not like that either but it has had to happen for the sake of devolution and the institutionsthe right hon gentleman is absolutely right to draw our attention to some of the terrible crimes that have been committed the shadow minister has been questioned on the issue of citing crimes from across the board i know that he very much condemns crimes wherever they come fromthe select committee is concluding its report into libyansponsored ira activity and i was rereading the proposed document this morning i will not go into the details as the committee has not considered it but in that draft report are many examples of ira violence\u2014of the way the ira has torn lives apart rereading some of those things this morning in the car as i came down to westminster served as a reminder of what has gone on in northern ireland and how unacceptable it wasi do not want to get into the issue of the prosecution of the soldiers at this point as that strays from the central part of our debate but of course one side in the conflict always referred to it as \u201cthe war\u201d they did so because that excused the indiscriminate killing of men women and children so one side had a \u201cwar\u201d and the other side was expected to go by the book\u2014or the yellow card to be precise that is a very unfair way of looking at this whole situation and the whole legacy issue", "my hon friend puts his finger on the problem yes this is a slippery slope but in some ways the bill offers an opportunity for people to get together  and reform the executive it would allow that to happen however my hon friend is right indeed it would probably not be the whole of this house that decided the rates that would be done by the secretary of state with respect to him that is the only way he could do this this goes back to what i said about direct rule earlier hon members will not get a say on the details whereas if these decisions were being taken in northern ireland there would be much more involvement by local people that would be far betteri really hope that the secretary of state will somehow be able to get the parties together in northern ireland so that we can avoid having committees upstairs here running northern ireland which would be most unsatisfactory whether he succeeds or not we really need to look at the belfast agreement and the legislation to see whether they need updating i do not wish to undermine the principles of power sharing in any way but we need to make an attempt to make it work at the moment it is not working if it were we would not be sitting here now and we would not have been in crisis 18 months ago i do not want everything to be set up again only to find that we are in crisis again after six or 12 monthsthe shadow secretary of state mentioned the petition of concern issue earlier i too raised that matter and i was told at the time that the parties were happy with the situation that and an awful lot of other issues need to be looked at we need to modernise and update the arrangements so that they can deal with the situation that we find ourselves in now rather than the one that we were in 20 years ago without doubt a lot of progress has been made in northern ireland we cannot deny that and we should not want to but we have to get the political process right as well if we do not people will completely lose faith in it and that would be in nobody\u2019s interests", "i agree with the hon gentleman about that particular point but a year ago\u2014i do not know whether he was at this meeting\u2014i made that very point to the then first minister peter robinson and the late martin mcguinness and they both defended the petition of concern process and said that it worked well for each side i entirely agree with the hon gentleman but

hon members when i encounter certain issues or problems with tenants and leaseholders of pubcos in my constituencyi declare a nonregistered interest in that my sister is the tenant of a pubco some of my remarks have been generated by my experience in that respect but not  exclusively so because i have a large number of pubs in my constituency one or two of them are now closed and are being changed into housing or car parking the concern about pub closures and about the lack of profitability of many pubs is my motivation for taking part in this debatelet me say from the outset that i am not instinctively opposed to the pubco model as such it has a number of advantages it allows people with very little capital to go into the pub trade in the first place in ordinary circumstances the pubco takes responsibility for the building and exterior work which can be very expensive as we all know when the system works well the pubco can provide some professional backup the model provides access to a wide range of beers it does not insist that wines and spirits are included in the tie although i may come back to that point it provides an opportunity for the landlord to run a restaurant on the premises and it provides accommodation where the landlord can live there are some good aspects of the pubco model in theory at least so i am not out to attack pubcos as suchin practice however there have been a lot of problems for example rents have been very unfairly assessed in many cases they are based not only on the profit that the pub makes from the tied beer but on the anticipated profit that it might get in certain circumstances from food the pubco benefits from the sale of its own beer but when the business does better the rent is quite often increased even though the pubco has benefited from the extra beer sales which seems quite unfair pubcos sometimes insist that landlords go on educational courses\u2014it really stretches the imagination to believe that someone who has been in the trade for a long time actually needs to go on such courses\u2014and the pubco benefits from the cost of the courseson many occasions pubcos insist that landlords use the pubco\u2019s own insurance policies which are enormously more expensive than those that can be found elsewhere in the market they will not allow another product to be used unless the wording of the alternative insurance policy is identical which seems very unfair this costs landlords an awful lot of money i have even known cases in which the tenant or leaseholder has been told that he must take out an insurance policy that covers the building even though they are not responsible for the building tenants are charged for cover for fixtures and fittings that is not necessary in many cases and in which the assessed value of the fixtures and fittings is far greater than their actual value so the landlord again loses out in such casesso there are all those problems and the rate of pub closures persuaded parliament to change the law but as the hon member for leeds north west accurately and comprehensively showed the legislation is not working as it should for example confusion surrounds who is entitled to the freeoftie option some landlords feel that only leaseholders or protected tenants are eligible that needs clarifying and i hope that the minister can do that for us todaysome tenants are not protected under the clause in the landlord and tenant acts that provides that a tenancy or a lease has to be renewed unless the organisation that owns the building wants to take it back for its own use many tenants or leaseholders have that clause struck out in the agreement that they reach that is all  well and good until they get to the point when they need a new tenancy or a new lease and they ask the pubco for a freeoftie option because they are not protected the pubco can simply refuse to renew the tenancy is that fair i suggest that it certainly is not again i would appreciate some clarification of the exact position it is an important matter in answer to a recent written question i was told that around 11500 tenants are protected by the code but there are many more pubs than that in the uk it is not always easy to get a new tenancy if tenants ask for a freeoftie arrangementthe pubcos also often use outside agencies to negotiate the new tenancies including chartered surveyors who probably do not understand the local trade if they understand the trade at all i have also received complaints that pubcos\u2019 business development managers do not properly discuss the available options with tenants tenants are told that even if the pubco is prepared to offer them a new tenancy the rent might go up considerably of course that is when the adjudicator is supposed to be brought in two points arise from that first that system makes for bad relations between the tenant and the pubco and that is not a good situation to be in secondly it poses the question of whether the adjudicator effectively and efficiently engages with pubs and landlords who take cases to them my experience so far is that that is not happeninganother tenant told me that the start of his new tenancy\u2014i emphasise \u201cnew tenancy\u201d he has already had one\u2014means effectively having to apply for his own pub as if he is a new tenant filling in cvs and application forms having to submit a new business plan and going on training courses which i mentioned earlier that he had to attend when he entered the trade he has been running a pub or a similar establishment for nearly 20 years so where is the sense and fairness in thatall that causes a great deal of stress and problems it is worth pointing out that tenants could fear\u2014and end up\u2014being not only out of work and out of business but out of a home because the pub is their home it is unlikely that in the course of being a pubco tenant they have been able to build up sufficient capital to buy a new home or a new business they are in a precarious position and the house of commons did not intend that when it passed the legislationthe value of pubs to their communities particularly in rural areas is enormous they are often meeting places and places where people can dine together clubs and societies can be formed and friendships can be made pubs also raise a lot of money for charities\u2014that is often forgotten pubs are valuable community assets i ask the minister as far she can today or following the debate to try to answer some of the questions and consider whether anything else can be done as

to serve under your chairmanship ms ryan i congratulate my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge on taking an interest and having the motivation to introduce this debate and on the

two occasions to bring us up to date he is obviously very engaged in this matter i know that he not only sympathises with the victims and their relatives but empathises with them when he appeared before the committee he demonstrated that he cares about the issue and i thank him very much for thatwhen we discuss the importance of this debate we receive a lot of evidence from victims and their families both orally and in writing if anyone doubts the pain that has been caused to people in this country by libyansponsored terrorism they need only read for example the evidence submitted by mr colin parry who following the attack in warrington had to make the heartwrenching and unbelievably difficult decision to turn off his child\u2019s life support machine i will not read through all the evidence he submitted but i urge hon members to read it on the website it describes why we are all so concerned about what happened we cannot bring those people back of course but we can try to recognise the pain of their loved ones\u2014that is the first step\u2014and then try to bring about some compensation for them or their communitieswe have received evidence from tony blair and gordon brown tony blair said he did not raise the issue and it was not raised with him gordon brown set up the reconciliation unit which tried to move things on we have two problems as the minister told the select committee he talked about the difficulty of dealing with the libyan government when they are not a stable government perhaps he will bring the chamber up to date with the position there now and tell us whether he believes it can be moved on now that things have moved on a little in libyathere is also the question of frozen assets which the select committee discussed i understand that something like \u00a38 billion or \u00a39 billion of frozen assets sourced from libya are held in the united kingdom i do not know whether the result of the vote that the country rightly made on 23 june will change any aspect of that the committee has been told that those assets cannot be touched i do not know whether brexit when it comes about will challenge that decision but perhaps the minister will bring us up to date on thatmy hon friend the member for aldershot sir gerald howarth said that some people have received some compensation but very little presumably that was through the statutory compensation scheme which was set up for such victims but as my hon friend the member for south suffolk pointed out it is uncertain\u2014and i think doubtful\u2014whether that money came from libya that is where the money should come from because we hear of a foreign state that was not only encouraging but physically supplying a terrorist organisation in this country to kill our own citizens if libya wants to become a serious constitutional country in the future and leave its pariah status behind it must pay compensation for the people they have murdered in this countrywe need to move this situation on it has been going on for a long time as we all know the victims and relatives are getting older some will have died i know that the situation is difficult and that diplomatically it might be difficult because we are trying to encourage libya to move on but it cannot move on without first clearing up the past i therefore ask the minister to continue to do

group on racing and bloodstock and i have the cheltenham racecourse in my constituencyit is from the horseracing point of view that i come to this debate because bookmakers very largely finance horseracing through the betting levy and through media rights if we lose too many bookmakers we will lose horseracing there is absolutely no question about that there are two very good racecourses in northern ireland which i have visited a number of times we also see the spectacle of the grand national the derby royal ascot and in my own constituency the cheltenham gold cup", "i will come to that

important to recognise that while certainly acknowledging the issues raised by the hon member for strangfordyou have asked us to take very little time each sir alan and i am happy to comply with that i hope that the government will continue with their evidencebased approach i am not convinced that there has been an increase in the number of problem gamblers there are people with addictive natures who will be addicted to something whether that is alcohol drugs or gambling but we are discussing only one form of gambling and many other forms are availableany member could use their mobile phone to empty their entire bank account into a betting account and lose all that money within a minute or two i mention that to draw attention to whether it would be fair to place restrictions on one kind of gambling when so many other forms are available including the national lottery i have linked horseracing to bookmaking and i also want to link the national lottery to the many good causes it supports billions of pounds have been spent on good causes thanks to the national lottery i have some news for members that money is taken not from the millions of pounds that are won but from the money that people lose on the national lottery each and every weeki hope we can get a measure of proportion into this debate the government should take seriously the important points and concerns raised by the

northern ireland which represents around 30 of the total there would close if fixed odds betting terminals were banned the hon lady is not calling for them to be banned but that shows the scale of the problem some 975 jobs would be lost costing \u00a318 million per annum throughout northern ireland the knockon effect for the betting industry and therefore for horseracing would be huge because it is the machines that tend to keep the shops going i am sorry that i did not explain that earlier but that is my point fixed odds betting terminals are far rarer in northern ireland where there are fewer than two per shop than in great britain where the number is nearer to four so i am not convinced that the problem is greater in northern ireland that does not mean that there is no problem but if there is one i do not think it is of the same scalesir alan you have indicated to me that i should draw my remarks to a close so i repeat to the government please continue to take an evidencebased

tribute to my constituency assistant who died very suddenly a few days ago his name was mark calway and he worked for me for 14 years and took a particular interest in matters northern ireland\u2014and indeed in matters the republic of ireland\u2014helping me quite a bit with my work on the select committee and as cochairman of the britishirish parliamentary assembly his death is a stunning shock and my heart goes out to his parents brian and maureen i do hope it is in order for me to pay the greatest tribute to him possible today all hon members know how much we depend on our staff and when they are personal friends as well such a loss at the age of 49 is terrible thank you very much indeed mr deputy speakermay i pay tribute to the secretary of state for the work she has done in getting us to this point i know\u2014or i think i know\u2014how difficult things were back in september when it looked as though the institutions in northern ireland might collapse i know how much work she put in\u2014or i am guessing i know that her dedication was total she was absolutely determined that the institutions would not collapse and that we would in fact find some degree of agreement and a solution that would enable us to move forward the fact that we are here today demonstrates that she was successful in that so i really do want to pay tribute to her\u2014and her team\u2014for the very hard work and extraordinarily long hours put into thisbefore i was select committee chairman i served as shadow minister for about five years during some of that time we dealt with an awful lot of legislation\u2014statutory instruments\u2014in committee upstairs taking major decisions on behalf of the province and the people in northern ireland on many of those occasions at the beginning of my speeches i said how wrong and inappropriate it was to govern the province in that way yet we really did face the prospect of going back to the previous situation and that worried and frightened me it came about as a result of a couple of tragic murders in northern ireland and the linkage between them and people in the assembly who were allegedly sympathetic to that kind of activity i am very pleased that this bill makes it clear that there is no place either in this place or the assembly in northern ireland for people who hold those beliefsmany years ago we heard the famous and chilling statement that some people would proceed with the armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other those days are long gone and anybody who tries to practise that or carry out politics in that way should be in prison deprived of their liberty there is no place in the northern ireland assembly for that kind of people we would not want to work on committees in this house or anywhere else with people who by day are in the debating chamber and at night are on the streets causing trouble and wreaking havoc we would not  accept it in this place and it should not be accepted in northern ireland so i am very pleased that the bill paves the way for removing that kind of behaviour", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for making that point which emphasises far more strongly than i was able to the importance of the assembly\u2019s functioning when we sat in committee taking big decisions the great problem was that by the nature of the arithmetic of this house there were very few people on the committee from northern ireland the decisions were taken by people like me and many others from english constituencies with very few representatives from northern ireland so the hon gentleman is absolutely right to make that pointthe most urgent priority was dealing with the paramilitary aspect but there were other issues which are dealt with in the bill one was the agreeing of the budgets i have mentioned before what happens when there is powersharing rather than the straight democratic system that we have in this house we all know why we have that powersharing and it has brought people together but there may be times when there has to be compromise in the way the northern ireland assembly and executive do business there may be times when politicians in the assembly and the executive take their stances make their points and make their objections but at the end of the day there has to be agreement if not and if there is an overuse of the petitions of concern\u2014i accept that both sides have used them to excess\u2014it is not going to be very helpful if we cannot get agreement on important issues such as the budget we face the rather dark prospect of the institutions collapsing as we almost saw and power being brought back to this house that is not something i want to see", "the hon gentleman makes a very good point and i would make two points in response when the select committee looked at the issue\u2014it was the first issue we looked at under my chairmanship back in 2010\u2014it was not unanimous in its support for  devolving responsibilities for corporation tax but all the parties in general were in favour of it corporation tax was one of the few issues that every party in northern ireland agreed with the policy on which was a real positivethe hon gentleman is absolutely right i am afraid we could have done something about it then the corporation tax rate for northern ireland could have been changed in 2010 or long before that had it not been for our membership of the eu i am not sure how far mr deputy speaker will allow me to pursue that argument but even if we wanted to reduce vat on tourism in northern ireland it would not be legal under eu rules there are a number of ways of looking at membership of the eu we spent two and a half hours on it earlier and i do not suppose we will be allowed to spend too much longer on it now but the point the hon gentleman makes is absolutely right", "indeed there is mr deputy speakeri was saying that i accept that petitions of concern have been used to excess by both sides and had not been very helpful in coming to agreements on important issues this is not contained in the legislation but i know that the fresh start agreement did address that point and did request in a very strong way as it were that that facility should not be abused for the reasons we have giveni do not wish to detain the house any longer but this small but important bill moves us in the right direction i compliment and congratulate the secretary of state on introducing it and\u2014as i said earlier\u2014on the enormous amount of hard work she has put in", "to ask the secretary of

this place it is normal to say what a pleasure it is to take part in the debate and while it is always a privilege to speak in this chamber it is rather regrettable that yet again we have to hold a debate on northern ireland because of problems in the province especially when as the hon gentleman said so much is right and working therelooking across at the opposition benches i see representatives of three parties and an independent although i see some disagreement i also see adetermination in all of them to make things in northern ireland work sadly however problems seem to get in the way of the institutions functioning as well as they mightas i see it\u2014i have only five minutes\u2014there are two problems to address tonight and in the next few weeks the first is the crisis\u2014it is a crisis\u2014of government in northern ireland where there are no longer properly functioning institutions we could say that that resulted from the very bad murders that took place\u2014indeed as the hon member for north antrim ian paisley pointed out we cannot skate over them\u2014followed by the chief constable\u2019s assertion that one of the murders was carried out by the ira which was supposed to have disbanded a long time ago we cannot ignore the fact that that is what brought about the immediate crisisit is also right to recognise\u2014the hon member for south antrim devoted much of his speech to this point\u2014that the institutions were not functioning before that the real and deeper reason for this problem as far as i can see is the design of those institutions we know why they were put together all those years ago\u2014to bring people together and to get them talking to each other instead of firing at each other\u2014and there could be no better reason than that for designing those institutions no one\u2019s heart could have failed to leap at the sight of dr ian paisley sitting with martin mcguinness that really gave us hope thinking back we have to accept that the way in which the institutions were designed\u2014with those who wanted to be elected to the assembly having to designate themselves unionists or nationalists or neither\u2014could be said to have institutionalised the very sectarianism we were trying to get away fromit is important to address the longerterm problems i do not think we shall get solutions this side of next year\u2019s elections in northern ireland but from that point on we have to look at ways of ensuring an effective decisionmaking body the institutions have brought people together and we should not underestimate that magnificent achievement which is a tribute to all those who worked so hard to bring it about and to the people of northern ireland and the great resilience they have shownit would be unfortunate however for anyone to suggest that revisiting the belfast agreement in order to improve it is somehow an attempt to unravel it that cannot be the case an attempt to make sure that the institutions work better in the future would enhance the principles of the belfast agreement and we have to show courage in doing that i would rather see proposals for improvement come from northern ireland\u2014from the assembly but also from ordinary men and women in northern ireland rather than from this place it is up to the people in northern ireland in those institutions to agree them and make them workwe must address the immediate crisis i would say to anyone on the assembly in northern ireland who is listening to the debate that i led for the conservative party many times when we were in opposition direct rule from a committee upstairs gave no one in northern ireland an opportunity to have their say on major parts of legislation it is surely better to make the

that", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time mr turner i congratulate my neighbour and hon friend the member for the cotswolds geoffrey cliftonbrown on securing this important debate the national planning policy framework is one of the most provocative issues in my constituency so i have held a number of debates on the issue here and in the main chamber tabled many questions and met the minister the previous minister and the one before thati thank the minister not just for being here but for having an opendoor policy that allows all hon members to meet him regularly i am afraid that whenever he gets a request from me for 10 minutes he sighs and thinks \u201coh no\u2014not him again\u201d but it reflects concerns that ihave i echo what has been said i think that we have moved the planning system on in a welcome direction it is not always appreciated as several hon members have said that this government did not introduce the presumption in favour of development or the planning inspectorate which my research suggests started to be developed in 1909having said all that there is a misconception among the public as previous speakers have said about what is actually going on it is caused partly by some of the uncertainties about the fiveyear land supply calculation for example to which i will return in a minute and partly by some councils\u2019 misunderstanding of the policies also the inspectorate has been inconsistent and applied some strange policies that do not seem to represent government policies as a result people in my area are concerned about what is going onmy local council tewkesbury\u2014although my constituency covers other areas as well\u2014is involved with cheltenham borough council and gloucester city council in coming up with a joint core strategy which has still not been agreed or finished as my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers said the second world war would have been started fought and finished in the time that they have been trying to pull together that joint core strategy there is no excuse for that they should be further oni am concerned about some of the things that are happening and some of the speculative applications being made particularly in villages the village in which i live has just been allocated 24 houses which i think is a sensible application that the borough council was right to accept but there are pressures for more and more houses not only in that village but a lot of other villages which is upsetting people greatly they do not mind organic growth or taking a fair share of housing but they do not want planning to be run by appeal they do not want the inspectorate effectively to reduce localism by saying \u201cyou will have 50 houses there\u201d or 100 housesthe reasons given by the planning inspectorate often involve the fiveyear land supply in a recent report on an appeal that it allowed at stoke orchard a small village in my constituency the inspector openly discussed the confusion about how to calculate fiveyear land supplies he said \u201cwell the council\u2019s saying there\u2019s 36 but the applicant is saying 29\u201d there is no certain way to assess it i have discussed this with the minister before but i ask him to come up with a policy or calculation that can be used so that councils know what they must doi am not altogether certain that it is the right way to assess applications anyway although some certainty is needed for example an appeal for 500 homes at a village called longford in my constituency\u2014a few years ago under the previous government\u2014was allowed with the stipulation that it had to be built within five years which is the normal planning application rule it was allowed on the basis that there was not a fiveyear land supply but the houses were not built within that five years so the applicant had to go back to the council for an extension of the permission does that not demonstrate that there was not as much demand for housing as the inspector suggested if there had beenthe developer would have built those houses that is how developers make money they do not make it in any other way than by building houses if there had been demand\u2014if they thought they could have sold the houses in those five years\u2014they would have built them but they did not i am concerned about the fiveyear land supply application policy\u2014not only the principle but the way in which it is being appliedif there is a fiveyear land supply in a village and if it needs meeting\u2014those are two big ifs\u2014it is not likely to be met by 50 houses here and 30 houses there but what those 50 and 30 houses often do is to make those villages unsustainable they do not have the infrastructure the shops or the roads to support them and it causes an awful lot of problems for people who live in those areasi mentioned interpretation by inspectors in an appeal allowed at a village called alderton in my constituency about a year or 18 months ago the inspector discussed the lack of the fiveyear land supply and actually said that the council might have to compromise areas of outstanding natural beauty when finding places for the houses in my understanding that is completely contrary to government policy\u2014if it is not it certainly should be\u2014and yet the inspector is allowed to make that kind of commentthat particular land was not an aonb or greenbelt land but that comment was made and subsequently it will be referred to in future appeals and assessments by inspectors so as well as clarifying the fiveyear land supply issue the government need to look at the reports being produced by inspectors to ensure that they reflect the government\u2019s policiesi know that one or two other hon members wish to speak so i will not go on too long i just wanted to make those two points in particular i will make one further point which perhaps stretches the bounds of the debate a little but relates to planninga while ago\u2014in fact it has probably always been the case\u2014parish councillors were required to register their interests however i knew of a number of parish councillors who resigned from their positions because they had to register the interests of their spouses or partners parish councils do not make decisions on planning they can express an opinion as anybody can the people who can make decisions on planning are planning officers\u2014not just councillors but planning officers\u2014and yet as i understand it there is no requirement for them to register their outside interests or indeed their family\u2019s outside interests i will not mention names now but i have concerns about certain cases and there should be some consistency in this sector because planning officers directly make decisions on planning they may not be decisions about 500 houses on a field but planning officers make certain decisions and yet there is no transparency about themthere should also be a requirement\u2014i do not think there is one currently\u2014that whenever planning officers meet developers those meetings should be carefully minuted again that is so that we can have transparency and so that people can have confidence in the planning system because at the moment despite the government\u2019s best efforts and best intentions i do not think there is that confidence in the system for a number of reasons which i have coveredi look forward to hearing the minister\u2019s response to the debate", "what recent discussions he has had with train operating companies on increasing the use of rural railway stations and if he will make a statement", "i thank the secretary of state for that response does he agree that one way we can get cars off the road and reduce congestion on our motorways and indeed on smaller roads is to develop rural train stations we have one at ashchurch for tewkesbury which is a very good station but it is underused at the moment can we try to make such stations better used by train operating companies", "i congratulate the minister and the secretary of state i also pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for north shropshire mr paterson who saw the importance of a measure such as this even when wewere in opposition and he was shadow secretary of state for northern ireland that was not the conventional thinking at the time as i well remember because i was working with him but he persisted and the bill eventually found its way to the chambernearly five years ago\u2014the time has passed quickly\u2014when the select committee was reformed and i had the privilege of becoming its chairman it decided to look into this matter we decided that in what was our first inquiry during the present parliament we would examine the current financial and economic issues rather than what might have been seen as the usual \u201corange or green\u201d issues we examined those issues in great detail and although i would be the first to admit that the report that we eventually published was not unanimously agreed we saw the importance of a measure such as this we also saw that it was not the silver bullet\u2014it was not the only measure that needed to be taken in northern ireland to rebalance its economy and make it more prosperous\u2014but we did consider it to be very importantas has already been mentioned northern ireland\u2019s geographical position makes it special in this context it shares a land border with another country and it is also part of an island which is in turn off another island that geographical position alone means that in order to attract the investment that it needs\u2014especially overseas investment\u2014it must have a different quality because otherwise people might prefer to invest on the mainland although that might be good for many of us it would not necessarily help northern ireland directly similarly if the uk were just like the rest of the european union there would be no reason for people invest here rather than on the continent i am pleased that many aspects of our economy and the way in which we run things are different from what happens in the rest of the european union because that makes ours an attractive economy and makes this country a very good place in which to invest as is clear from figures that were published only recentlya short time ago when the select committee visited belfast we had the pleasure of meeting senator gary hart he was there principally to engage in political discussions but we discussed the economy as well and he made a great many encouraging noises about the prospect of american investment in northern ireland if this step were takeni hope that the northern ireland assembly will take advantage of the bill when it is passed because it is one of the very few measures with which all the parties in northern ireland\u2014and i think all the parties in the house\u2014agree that is a very unusual situation in itself but it is extremely welcome because it gives us an opportunity to improve the economy in northern ireland to a greater extent than we have done so far that is important for two reasons it will ensure that people in northern ireland enjoy more prosperity and it will give them the opportunity to cement the relative peace that has been achieved there a strong economy will obviously help the cementing of that peace for those two reasons in particular i am very happy to support the bill", "to ask the secretary of state for health what steps he is taking to minimise disruption for patients at shift changeovers in hospital wards and if he will make a statement", "to ask the

i join the minister in paying tribute to all the many charities and voluntary organisations in northern ireland which as he rightly says have done so much invaluable work over the years what recent

antrim sammy wilson who drew on his experience in the northern ireland assembly to make a very useful speech i also congratulate the secretary of state on introducing the bill which has taken a good deal of skilful negotiation and on doing so before the election it would have been easy to push it back i think the whole house is grateful to heri also pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for north shropshire mr paterson i had the pleasure of working with him in opposition when he thought outside the box and came up with this idea yes it had been discussed to some extent but it had not been fullydiscussed in this place at the time there was opposition as there always is when somebody comes up with a radical new idea but he had the foresight determination and courage to press ahead and when he became secretary of state he made it clear that it was one of the most useful things we could do for northern ireland we are now seeing the benefit of his worka few years ago this proposal was the first thing the select committee looked at when we wanted to find something that moved us away from the orange and green issues and the security situation\u2014serious though it was\u2014to look at different ways of helping the people of northern ireland we thought that the economy was one way we could do that we took evidence from a great many witnesses\u2014businesses trade unions and very many other people\u2014and eventually came up with a report that recommended the devolution of corporation tax to the assembly i should point out that it was not a unanimous decision several committee members had concerns or reservations a number of which have been addressed by the hon member for east antrim however we felt that the benefits would be overwhelming and that we could address the problems that the decision might throw upas has been said northern ireland is the only part of the united kingdom that shares a land border with another country and that country happens to have corporation tax at a much lower rate as has been pointed out southern ireland\u2014the republic of ireland\u2014stuck to that policy through thick and thin i remember going to see the eu commissioner when the select committee was looking at the issue he was rather dubious about the republic of ireland\u2019s low level of corporation tax and expected that it would have to roll over give way and increase the rate however as i said to him that might have been okay in the short term but what would it have done for the republic of ireland\u2019s longer term prospects i am glad that that country won the dayi recognise\u2014i say this as a unionist\u2014that there was some concern about setting the rate of corporation tax in northern ireland to match that in the republic as though that was somehow giving up or compromising on britishness it is nothing of the sort we have a single electricity market across ireland ireland is promoted as one for tourism\u2014i think we could do more on that\u2014and there are experiments with common visa arrangements all that is sensible to me that is not about green or orange it is not about britain or a united ireland these are sensible measures giving the assembly the ability to cut the rate of corporation tax in northern ireland to compete with the south would be a simple and sensible arrangement and there is a need to do itas we have seen from the economic statistics which have been discussed in the house and repeated many times northern ireland lags behind on many measures when compared with the rest of the united kingdom it is doing okay\u2014it is improving and getting there\u2014but it really needs a boost to move it along rather more rapidly that is why interestingly as well as most members of the committee and most witnesses agreeing with the proposal to devolve responsibility for corporation tax to the assembly\u2014along with every political party in northern ireland which is rather unusual\u2014the irish government agree with it too i have heard the taoiseach on more than one occasion say that he thinks it wouldbe a good idea for northern ireland to be able to have the same level of corporation tax he does not see it particularly as a threat he sees it as a sensible movethe committee also found that corporation tax in itself is not necessarily the silver bullet it is not going to transform the whole economy\u2014other measures are needed such as improvements in the planning regime and many other areas\u2014but it is a good headline grabber it will grab the attention of the business world and that can only be a good thing for example just a few weeks ago the committee travelled to belfast and had a meeting with senator gary hart who was over to help with the discussions we put the point to him and he said the change would remove one of the reasons for not investing in northern ireland because when people look from afar and see the island of ireland where are they going to go of course other factors come into play too but if corporation tax is 125 in the republic and 20 in northern ireland surely that is a draw towards the republic of ireland he said he would be willing to try to set up a trade delegation from the united states to come to northern ireland with a view to exploring the investment opportunities that has to be a very positive move indeedagain looking from afar it is not just that northern ireland shares a land border with the republic of ireland that is a compelling reason for making this move northern ireland is also part of an island off an island if it is exactly the same as the rest of the united kingdom what is the benefit of investing in northern ireland we have to ask ourselves that question what will draw companies to northern ireland rather than investing on the mainland if everything is the same perhaps they will not do that but if things are more attractive in northern ireland surely companies and investors will consider their options in the province to an extent it is the same with the united kingdom which is one of the very many reasons why i am not for making ourselves exactly the same as the european union if we are exactly the same as mainland european countries such as germany or france what is the attraction of coming to the united kingdom and investing here there has to be a reason for people to come here and it is up to us to give them that reasoni want to touch on another point which is slightly off the issue but which is important when we consider the extent of the benefit that reducing corporation tax might bring when we were in the united states on a select committee visit about 18 months ago we discussed this issue\u2014very positively\u2014and a number of others but one thing that came up time and again was the violent scenes that we see on our television screens and which are flashed across the world no matter what this place or the assembly does on tax or any other incentives it is destroyed in a single night with a single vision of any violent scenes or paramilitary activity that is flashed across the world nothing could drive people away from northern ireland in a worse way or more quickly than that anybody in a republican organisation or a socalled loyalist organisation who engages in such activity is betraying the people they purport to represent they really ought to bear that in mindthere are a number of issues that perhaps need to be looked at in greater detail i am not making a criticism but i would ask the secretary of state whether she has given any thought to how the bill might be consideredduring its committee stage as i understand it it will be considered in committee upstairs however there are a number of issues that still need discussion so it might be an idea to consider holding the committee stage on the floor of the house as we move towards the election sometimes the chamber is not as heavily used as it might be at other times maybe we could consider discussing these issues in a way that allowed all members to take part rather than just a few members upstairsi understand the reason why this change cannot be introduced absolutely straight away but i am a little concerned that it is being pushed back two years a lot can happen in two years however while we have the full agreement of people in all the political parties in northern ireland\u2014on this issue at least if not on any other\u2014let us take advantage of that let us drive this forward as quickly as we can", "the hon gentleman makes a very reasonable point which i suppose goes back to the point made by my right hon friend the member for north shropshire who said we should get on at least with saying what we are likely to do as that will start the ball rollingwe also have to be careful not to expect too much of the assembly when it comes to looking like an efficient decision making machine and getting this matter devolved as everyone in this house knows it was not designed for the purpose of being an efficient decision making machine it was designed to bring people together to bring about peace and there can be no greater cause than that that issue has already started to be addressed through the stormont house agreement nevertheless the assembly is not the most effective machine it has its problems\u2014there is of course the need for votes on both sides to be in a majority all that is not how this place works nor would we get very much passed if we worked in that way the assembly was set up in that way for a different purpose so i do not think too much store should be set by that we should get on with this proposal in any casethere are other important matters including planning skills and education are important too we must ensure that we have a skilful and well educated work force in northern ireland and then it becomes important for northern ireland to retain the people it educates so many times we see a number of countries training and educating their people well only to see them attracted to work abroad rather than bring the benefits of their skills and education to their own country we need a peaceful society in northern ireland for that to

my hon friend the member for wycombe steve baker for introducing the debate and making many sensible points the previous speaker my hon friend the member for fylde mark menzies touched on what i want to say right at the end of his speech when he talked about the planning inspectorate perhaps not reflecting the government\u2019s intention on 24 october last year i held a debate in this chamber that was well attended by a number of members each of whom made their own different points my point then was that planning policy needed to be clarified on the one hand the government were saying that we have to have loads more houses but on the other they were saying that we need to protect the green belt and such areas the minister to his great credit listened carefully to that debate and some while after that called a number of us together to present the clarification of the policy particularly on unmet need and the impact that that could have on the green belt he said that the green belt should take precedence he also clarified the duty to cooperate when he said that it was not necessarily a duty to agree if that meant that the green belt would be compromised he made very many other clarifications which were extremely usefulmy concern is on the extent to which the guidance is being followed by the planning inspectorate and the local councils that are putting together plans and joint core strategies in my area to give an example of the problems in tewkesbury we have a great deal of greenbelt land many areas of outstanding natural beauty and an awful lot of floodrisk areas tewkesbury\u2019s assessed housing need for the next 20 years is 10900 houses yet it is proposed that it will take 18900 a lot of those houses will be built on the green belt which i believe to be contrary to government policy i have taken that up with the local councils and they fear that the inspectorate which will look at the plan and say whether it is sound will not follow the minister\u2019s guidance that is what they genuinely feel at this stage it is difficult to say who is right but the councils although they do not want to build on the green belt or in floodrisk areas feel that they might have to do thatthere are various recent inspectors\u2019 reports\u2014there was one just last week in somerset\u2014where the inspector appeared to disregard consideration for the green belt i say \u201cappeared\u201d because it was a rather confusing report and much confusion surrounds the decision in my area there seems to have been a compromise on an area of outstanding natural beauty in an appeal that was allowed on a development of 50 houses in the village of alderton that does not sound like a lot but it is a significant increase on the number of houses it has although it is an area of outstanding natural beauty the inspector seemed to say that where there is unmet housing need the aonb might have to be compromised i believe that to be contrary to the government\u2019s policy they have clearly said that unmet need should not outweigh any significant harm that might be caused to the green belt or other such areas", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for making that pointwhen the government came to power they got rid of the regional spatial strategy system of planning and that was welcomed that was a good move we introduced the localism act 2011 but as my hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes correctly said people feel let down they feel that the 2011 act and the principle of localism have not delivered and do not look like they will deliver what people want", "yes i certainly would agree we need to give more power to people and that was suggested by the title of the debate which my hon friend the member for wycombe introduced local people feel that they are being ridden over by developers and that there is further confusion in the planning system i entirely agree with my hon friend that we need to simplify to ensure consistency and to clarify certainly in my area what the duty to cooperate actually means more work needs to be done he rightly referred to the letter from the minister to sir michael pitt which said that greenbelt land can be removed in the local plan process only in consultation with local people and i must say that local people do not want that to happen if it does happen it is not because local people want it to happen they believe in localism and welcomed the localism act 2011 but they are not convinced that it is delivering for them it is better not to have a policy than to have one that goes on to disappointmentmy constituents are not opposed to development i work every day to bring jobs to my constituency as i am sure that all hon members do and with those jobs must come housing in 2007 my constituency was under water due to flooding people lost their water supplies for three weeks and many people had to live in caravans for over a year we had such devastation which was threatened again earlier this year\u2014the prime minister came to see the situation\u2014and we do not want houses built in the wrong areas that is what my constituents would want me to say todaythe members present are almost exclusively conservative we have one labour frontbench spokesperson and a couple each from the dup and the liberal democrats i probably should not say this publicly but if we do not clarify the policy and sort it out the conservative party will lose votes i want the minister to take that on board that is not the reason to

part of the team that approached the backbench business committee to ask for this debate up to that point we had had only an hour of discussion in the house of commons when i tabled the urgent question on 26 february this debate is useful because an urgent question does not allow the house full discussionsince 2010 the select committee has tended to concentrate on economic issues we have looked at corporation tax air passenger duty fuel laundering and smuggling and the amounts of money being lost we have touched on the armed forces covenant and we are coming to the end of an inquiry into the structure of banking in northern ireland in other words we have tried to help to regenerate the economy in northern ireland believing that to be very important for the prosperity of the people who live there and with a view to attempting to cement the peace that has been achieved over the past 16 years or so i am sure committee members would have been happy to take that policy forward towards the next general election however that changed on 25 februaryspeaking for myself i was not aware of any such scheme i was obviously aware that the john downey case was being considered as i got a telephone call that day explaining the judgment and letting me know the background to it it came as a complete surprise to methat there was any such thing as an administrative scheme it was a big surprise because in 2005 through to january 2006 i led for the conservative party on the northern ireland offences bill which attempted to grant an amnesty across the board it was the realisation that that amnesty went across the board that caused sinn fein to stop supporting the bill and the bill was subsequently withdrawn i received a telephone from the then minister of state who asked to see me he informed me that the government were in his words pulling the bill there was no support for it and it was not going to happeni was not aware at that point or earlier or up to 25 february that there was any other way of dealing with the socalled ontheruns the select committee found itself in a changed position after 25 february i have never known the members of that committee to be so exercised over any issue as they have been over this which has persuaded us to launch an inquiry into the background to this scheme and everything connected with it despite the fact that there is a judgeled inquiry appointed by the government which we welcome and an inquiry is being held by the justice committee in the assembly the leader of which i met just the other day both inquiries are welcome and we will probably concentrate on different areaswe start with the case itself and a stay being put on the case we have taken legal advice on the matter i am advised that the government cannot appeal a stay that was the advice that i received just yesterday i would be glad to hear the secretary of state\u2019s response to that because it seems an extraordinary judgment that possession of a letter can take on greater importance than a murder charge i make no suggestion as to whether mr downey is guilty or innocent that is not the role of a politician and i do not have the facts to hand but a murder charge was made\u2014in fact a charge of multiple murder and injury\u2014yet possession of a letter appeared to assume greater importance than that charge i find that very surprising indeed", "i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention he is a valuable member of the select committee and i am grateful to him for his support on this and many other issues the point he makes is correct not being a lawyer myself i cannot make a judgment on whether that is normal my suggestion is that perhaps it is not normal i understood courts always to look at the facts before them but in this case the court seems to have relied on this letter which concentrated on the fact that the psni did not want to question mr downey it said only that in the psni\u2019s belief no other police force in the united kingdom wanted to question him\u2014it was not a categorical assurance that letter weak and flimsy though it may sound seems to have taken on a greater importance because of the political process i would be the first to say that it is very important that we do not unravel the peace process or undo the enormous achievements in northern ireland but the rule of law applies here as well as the separation of powers between the executive parliament and thecourts which has to be observed i suggest that all the inquiries have that as the central motivation behind their opening", "i am grateful to the attorneygeneral for that clarification of the possibility of appealing in that case that certainly was the advice that i received yesterday from an eminent qc\u2014", "my understanding from our discussions yesterday was that a stay cannot be appealed", "i am again grateful to the attorneygeneral for that clarification although it is in some contradiction to the advice i received from queen\u2019s counsel yesterday perhaps this matter could be taken up further but at this stage it is probably better to move on from the case", "i agree with the hon gentleman and that is why the conflicting advice we have received has to be explored further if a stay cannot be appealed it cannot be appealed but if\u2014as the attorneygeneral suggests\u2014the issue is that there is no prospect of overturning the judgment my view as a nonlawyer isthat we should consider an appeal it is extraordinary that a letter which appears to be ambiguously worded can take on greater importance than a charge of multiple murder i do not know whether it is unique but it is extremely unusual", "i do not think that anyone would disagree with what the attorneygeneral has just said the problem is that the judgment in the downey case appears to have taken the political situation into account and that is what concerns everyone royal pardons appear to have been given but i do not know what they were given for or which crimes were being overlooked if that was not done on a political basis i do not know what constitutes a political basis the point that we are trying to make is that such decisions should be made on a legal basis not a political basisthe one good aspect is that the judgment has blown open the whole issue and drawn attention to what has been going on the northern ireland offences bill was introduced in 2005 presumably because it was felt necessary to put the scheme on to a statutory basis to give it a public airing or some respectability it now seems that the scheme had been running since 1999 but it was six years before the bill was introduced the bill was dropped but the scheme continued was the scheme legitimate for all that time if it was why the need for the billas the right hon member for belfast north said the 1998 legislation\u2014some of which i also voted against for all sorts of reasons\u2014addressed very unpalatable issues but at least we could debate and vote on them publicly", "my hon friend who is a valuable member of the select committee points out that a referendum was held on that legislation that was completely in the open so why was this scheme not made public we will need to look at that issueit is claimed that the letters were just assurances that no one was being looked at by the psni it was just an administrative scheme and simply a matter of informing people that they were not wanted but we are also told that the scheme was crucial to the peace process and if it had not been done the whole peace process would have somehow unravelled both those statements cannot be correct if it was just a matter of clearing the police computer and moving things on it cannot have been crucial to the peace process", "my hon friend makes an important point i do not want to go back to the downey case in too much detail because i am trying to make progress but it was an extraordinary judgmenti also question who received these letters who are the ontheruns if a completely innocent person received a letter saying that they were not wanted by the police that would be extraordinary it does not happen there has to be a reason why people were on the run what exactly does \u201con the run\u201d mean what were they suspected of doing what did they fear the police thought they might have done to put their names forward why did they need confirmation that they were not wanted that is central to the whole debatei am also concerned about the number of letters that appear to have been sent out i am not quite sure of the exact figures but those i have suggest that 221 letters were sent out with 10 being provided by the prison service which i find a little confusing and four by the government of the republic of ireland which i find a bit worrying that is according to the statement made by the secretary of state a couple of days ago we are told that that does not amount to an amnesty but what about the royal pardons again the advice i have received is that those are normally issued following a miscarriage of justice not to prevent a case from being brought against a person in the first place and that prompts the question of what the pardons were issued forthe timing of this issue is unfortunate as i said during the urgent question as we speak the psni is advertising for people to come forward as witnesses to the bloody sunday killings of 1972", "we will certainly ask about that and i do not know why it was not devolved to the northern ireland assembly when a justice minister was in place\u2014a justice minister who confirmed to me and other members of the committee that he did not know anything about the scheme i do not know why the matter was not devolved but it is something we will consideras i was saying the psni is looking for people to come forward as witnesses to the bloody sunday killings let me say straightaway that i do not believe in any amnesties if republicans have committed crimes they should be charged if loyalists have committed crimes they should be charged and if members of the security forces have committed crimes they should be charged this seems to be a onesided scheme in 2005 the government tried to open it up to everybody but it was rejected by all parties and withdrawn because we donot believe in amnesties it seems however that there is a scheme for certain members of the community but not for others which cannot be rightmy hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron is quite right and the committee will certainly consider why this issue was not devolved following the devolution of policing and justice in april 2010 we also published the terms of reference on 11 march they are quite comprehensive and we want to carry out a full and deep inquiry we do not want it to run on for ever but we will certainly do it properly and interview a range of people including past and present secretaries of state ministers police officers relevant civil servants and others the first session will be held next week with former senior police officers yesterday we appointed two eminent barristers\u2014i cannot name them at the moment\u2014including a queen\u2019s counsel to become special advisers to the committee during this inquiryit is important to recognise the progress made in northern ireland over the past 16 years but there are no amnesties and no excuse for violence the rule of law must be upheld by all concerned so although i regret the need to delve into the past once again it is sometimes necessary to do so in order to secure the future", "will my right hon friend update the house on the development of vaccines for badgers and indeed cattle", "may i\u2014interruption", "i thank the

brief speech in this important debate my constituency did not flood immediately but the waters got there in the end and the continuing rain made for a difficult couple of weeks i was grateful to the prime minister for coming in person to see the effects and meet a number of people who told him what we needed to do\u2014and to avoid doing\u2014in our area i will outline one or two of those things in a momenti was pleased with the government\u2019s response to the flooding so far as my constituency was concerned i was also pleased that the army was called in to help certain vulnerable people and i commend the good work done by the fire and rescue services the police the environment agency and a number of the local councillors who responded very quickly to the flooding", "i am grateful to my hon friend for his intervention i have to say that there is very little chance of his going red as far as i know he makes a good point and he knows far more than i do about the financing of the armythe government response in my area was certainly very good and a number of the schemes that have been built there in the past few years have also been very successful nevertheless three of the four roads that serve the town of tewkesbury were closed and the situation was becoming serious sadly a number of houses were also flooded i say \u201chouses\u201d but i should rephrase that they are people\u2019s homes some homes in sandhurst and longford which are villages just down the river severn were flooded for the third time in not very many years and it was heartbreaking to visit them the challenge which i want to discuss with the government is how we can avoid such flooding in the futureit has been acknowledged that the government cannot control the weather and we seem to have experienced rather different weather cycles over the past few years nobody will have forgotten the terrible floods of 2007 when my right hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar mr pickles came to visit tewkesbury and saw some of the problems that we were facing even people on the other side of the world heard about thosefloods i have spoken to people in australia who remember seeing the famous picture of the flooded land surrounding tewkesbury abbey the abbey itself did not flood and neither did an even older church just down the way at deerhurst\u2014it was built in about the 8th century\u2014even though the village does floodthe important point which i am going to have to take up with the secretary of state although i raised it in an intervention and he did mention the building is how vital it is not to continue to build in floodrisk areas i hear what he says about 10 of the country being at flood risk i have only a simple education but i suggest that we do not build in the 10 and concentrate building in the 90 surely there is enough room to build the houses that we needi want to take up the issue of house building because of a number of sites in my area that have been given planning permission one of them is absolutely covered in water\u2014it is at longford in an area that floods badly permission was granted on appeal by the previous government but i do not know why that happened that was six years ago but the houses have not yet been built planning permission has been given for a lot of houses in both bishop\u2019s cleeve and brockworth but those too have not yet been built i say to my right hon friend and to the government that i do not accept that there is this need for housing which is being expressed this need is being overestimated by the government i have raised the issue before and we need to look at the point carefully", "i agree with my hon friend and i am grateful to him for that intervention however the councils in my area are saying that the government are putting so much pressure on them to build a given number of houses that they have no choice but to build them in greenbelt and floodrisk areas i am sorry to have to say it to the secretary of state but that is what my local councils are telling me they are saying that they cannot accommodate the number of houses that they will be required to build without impinging on the green belt and without putting them in floodrisk areas that is open for debate but that is what my local councils are clearly saying to me i really need him to examine the situation carefully and as a matter of urgency because it is causing a very big problem that issue was raised with the prime minister when he came to my constituency a week or so agoi wish to raise one or two other points about building in floodrisk areas first this issue comes down to what we define as a \u201cfloodrisk area\u201d i understand that the environment agency will assess an area as being at flood risk only if it is at risk from river flooding and not if it is at risk of surface water flooding i would be happy to be corrected on that but that is the situation as i understand it someone whose home is floodeddoes not really care what kind of water it is or where it has come from because the situation is bad and they do not want it to happen perhaps the government need to give different advice to the environment agency on how it classifies floodrisk areas", "i am grateful to the minister for that and i will certainly take it up with the environment agency locally but the map i saw just a couple of weeks ago was not coloured blue where there is surface water flooding we need to take that up but i will certainly take his words back to the local environment agencyi am also concerned about what the environment agency has told me about the costbenefit ratio of flood prevention schemes i raised this in a written question and i was told \u201cas long as it is greater than a level ratio that is okay they can go ahead and carry out those schemes\u201d but that is not what the environment agency is saying to me when i raise these points with it so again i have to take these points back to the environment agency to see what we can do to have even more schemes put into placei hear what has been said about dredging and desilting they are not the entire answer to the problem but in some areas especially where there are pinch points we must carry out that work although dredging and desilting are carried out in certain parts of the country they used to be carried out an awful lot more i am pleased that the prime minister has now weighed in on this and agreed that they should take place in certain areas and that is what we are pressing the environment agency to doi welcome a number of the initiatives that have recently been taken to help compensate people who have been flooded and to provide for the repairs and replacements that they need will there be any help for people to provide their own flood defences so that they do not get flooded in the first place people who are better off may be able to afford to do that but those who are less well off cannot it would be better if we could help people to prevent the flooding in the first place as well as trying to help those who have been floodedon the issue of insurance i am pleased that a lot of progress has been made on the flood re scheme but what about the excess payments an insurance company might provide the insurance but if it puts an excess of \u00a330000 or \u00a340000 which i have come across on a property it is effectively not covered because an owner would have to pay so much to put it right that they would not be getting any insurance money back i do not know whether the excesses will be covered in the flood re scheme", "my right hon friend is nodding i look forward to receiving more details on that that is good news if that is to be the casefinally i ask the secretary of state to revisit the issue of housing numbers and to prevent houses being built in the wrong places where they are likely to flood or cause other houses to flood", "the secretary of state talks about development being directed away from floodrisk areas unless it is absolutely necessary however the question is why is it absolutely necessary to build in certain areas that are at great risk of flooding including in my constituency which he has been kind enough to observe", "urgent question to ask theattorneygeneral to make a statement on the background to yesterday\u2019s judgment on john downey", "i should like to thank you mr speaker for allowing this urgent question and i thank the attorneygeneral for his statement may i explore some of the background to this matter it has been clearly stated that the letter did not constitute an amnesty but if that is the case why did the judge take the decision that he took in these circumstances it would surely be appropriate for the government to consider making an appealmay i also explore how we have arrived at this situation i was a shadow northern ireland minister when the northern ireland offenders bill was withdrawn because it was obviously not going to get through parliament there was no mention at the time of any other deal being likely does the attorneygeneral not consider what has happened since then to be a discourtesy to parliament does he like me wonder who authorised the scheme that seems to have replaced the legislation that must surely have been the then prime minister will the attorneygeneral tell us who wrote the letters to the people who are often referred to as ontheruns what was in the letters and i am afraid that i have to ask why the police service of northern ireland gave an assurance to mr downey that no other police force in the united kingdom had any interest in him when it knew that that was not the casemay i also ask the attorneygeneral how many people have received letters under the scheme will he tell me whether all those who have received such letters are from a republican background at a time when the psni is advertising for bloody sunday witnesses to come forward does he

agree that one clear way for the government to help pubs would be to cut the tax charged on beer which can amount to 37 on the average pint that is a huge amount of money and any tax cut would benefit customers and landlords", "let me declare a nondeclarable interest as it were my sister along with her husband runs the local pub the village inn in twyning the village i live in so although i do not have absolutely firsthand experience of the pub trade i have what must pass as a close interesti echo what has been said about the value of pubs to communities they are not only places where people drink they are places where they eat and meet many golf societies darts clubs and pool tournaments are hosted by pubs and they are of great value to local communities in rural areas especially pubs also raise a lot of money for charities just this saturday gone i had the honour of presenting three cheques totalling almost \u00a34000 to local charities and that picture is replicated across the countryhowever we have concerns we are seeing many pubs closing as has been said and many landlords getting by on very little money their profits have been squeezed by the business model under which many of them are operating there are no easy answers to the problem as i said in an intervention i held an adjournment debate on this issue in the last parliament during which there were other such debates the then government were accused of not responding to a report that came out in that parliament i do not seek to make a party political point about that i merely suggest that it is fairly unusual for the house to be almost in total agreement when discussing a problem as it is today yet for us all to be struggling to come up with a solution that will actually workas has been mentioned the idea was tried with the beer orders in 1989 when breweries were barred from holding more than a certain number of pubs that gave birth to the pubcos that we now see which then bought pubs and other properties at high prices as has been rightly said they are now trying to recoup that money in some cases quite desperately", "i am not at all surprised to hear that i do not know the exact figure but i do know that that is what has given rise to problem to the extent that it is onei recognise that there is a problem and i want us to move on as quickly as we can to help hardworking people who are keeping pubs going at the centre of communities there are problems\u2014i want to stress that point\u2014but i want us to come up with a lasting solution that will not make matters worse there are some benefits to the existing situation\u2014i will come to the weaknesses in a minute for example a pubco can allow people who do not have a great deal of capital to enter the trade they might be unable to afford to spend \u00a3300000 \u00a3400000 or \u00a3500000 on buying a pub outright or to borrow that money they also get their accommodation basically covered\u2014certainly in most cases\u2014while they run the pub which gives them some securityi do not recommend the tie at all but i am concerned about what would happen to the rent if there were no tie i am not speaking against reassessing the rent against a market level but if we do that what do we compare it with if we are looking beyond pubs we might look to mcdonald\u2019s for example or other franchise organisations is that a direct comparison i am not quite sure how the proposal would work in detail\u2014and of course the devil is always in the detail what about the repairing side of the lease will people with a fixed market rent be required to do more repairing of the fabric of the building than they are now i am not throwing those questions out as stumbling blocks or trying to cause a problem but they need answering", "not exactly no because how do we determine what the market rent level is is it the level for those with a tie or those without a tie what about a repairing lease or a nonrepairing lease these are all details that need filling out but i am not aware that they have been properly addressed i want to deal with them and to make progress but i am not sure we are there yet", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman perhaps i could now move on to how rents are assessed as has been said quite often they are assessed not onthe turnover of a pub but on the potential turnover which takes in things such as food and nontied products there is therefore an unfairness in the way that rents are assessed now if we can move to a better system i will certainly support thatas has been said there is also the inflated cost of tied products for example certain pubcos will charge \u00a313070 for a keg of carling when it can quite easily be bought\u2014we have looked at these figures\u2014for \u00a395 that is a huge difference which squeezes the profits of the landlord and makes the beer more expensive for consumers to give another example stowford is sold for \u00a311270 when it can be sourced for \u00a37999 those are just two examples i could go on and on if i had the time i think hon members realise that this is a problemmy hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds and my right hon friend the secretary of state both mentioned this but this debate is not just about the rent and the tie we make a huge mistake if we believe that we can look at those aspects at the beginning of a contract taken out with a pubco but the relationship goes on from there and sometimes it is the behaviour of the pubcos that causes the problems for example pubcos have the power to install fixtures and fittings and charge an exorbitant amount to the landlord but he will not get anything back for them basically the fixtures and fittings rule which has been in existence for a long time is a con i am afraid i thought carefully about whether i should use that word but i think that rule is a con it is an additional rent that people have to pay which again squeezes the profitswhen people go into a pub owned by a pubco they often have to go on expensive courses run by that pubco for which it can charge exorbitant amounts the cost of carrying out electricity checks for example has doubled in one year at the local pub i mentioned it is the same pub so why has the cost doubled these are the sort of extraordinary charges that pubcos sometimes make in the course of running their ordinary businessextraordinary decisions are sometimes taken the local pub i mentioned needed about \u00a3100000 of work carried out but the electrics and the roof were not completed when that work was done there seemed to be an obsession with putting up new wallpaper which was not necessary and not at all important the work needed to be done over a sixweek period yet the period covering the jubilee week of last year was suggested that is unbelievable\u2014the busiest week of the busiest year in memory was chosen and when the landlord refused to have the work done then and asked why it could not be done in january there was a startled reactioni am providing examples to show that it is not just about the rent or the tie it is about the behaviour of the pubcos as they go through the period of the agreement i do not know how best to assess and tackle the problem which is as important as other issues discussed todayi have had my 10 minutes i would have liked to talk about more issues but in summary i believe it is important to be careful to get this matter right i think we need to take a little longer\u2014i suggest not years but months sometimes government interventions can make things worse sometimes governments can be the problem rather than the solution as i said at the outset i believe that there is a problem and that it needs fixing", "i have a lot of sympathy for what has been said in the debate so far but i am a little troubled by suggestions that this problem arose only in may 2010 i had an adjournment debate on the issue during

join others in condemning the attacks on the office of the hon member for belfast east naomi long who is a very valuable member of the select committee on northern ireland affairs having worked with her on that committee for three years i know that she will not be put off by the attacks she will continue to show great determination and to carry out the work that she has been doing with great distinctionthe select committee was keen for a move towards transparency as regards donations in northern ireland partly as has been said to move the province towards what might be termed more normal politics it was interesting we took evidence from all the political parties\u2014not just the main ones but the smaller ones in northern ireland\u2014and i think that i am right in saying that there was unanimous agreement that we should move towards greater transparency on donations there were some question marks about how quickly that should happen and about the security situation but it was generally accepted that people who stand for office in northern ireland and those who sign nomination papers put up posters or go canvassing take the same risks as people who make donations to political parties in northern ireland why would they be any different for me that was the convincing argumentas my right hon friend the minister pointed out clause 1 allows the secretary of state the discretion to make the decision the select committee suggested that there be a statutory duty on the secretary of state to consult the appropriate security authorities with regard to taking that decision but overwhelmingly we felt that we should move towards greater transparency regarding donations in northern ireland like the hon member for belfast east i am grateful to the government for

arguments being made i am in favour of the general thrust of the bill and its intentions although like my hon friend the member for shipley philip davies i believe that the reasons for introducing it go beyond regulation and consumer protection i sat in some of the same meetings as my hon friend when we debated potential levels of taxation and he is right to say that the bill is mainly about providing the government with the ability to tax\u2014a point to which i will returnlet me state one or two nondeclarable interests i am a joint chairman of the allparty group on racing and bloodstock and the cheltenham race course is in my constituency i have a deep interest in horse racing which is financed largely if not entirely through the levy that comes from bookmakers and from sponsorships that also come from bookmakers another nondeclarable interest is that through the allparty group i organise charity dinners in this place which are heavily supported by bookmaking companies the last one took place just a few months ago and we raised \u00a348000 for charity over the last five years\u2014not entirely under my joint chairmanship as my predecessors should be included\u2014 we have raised \u00a3234000 for charities and it has come largely from bookmakers i thus want to pay tribute tothe legitimate and wellrun companies in bookmaking and to recognise the role they play in communities in charities and in helping to finance horse racingas has been said the bill is quite limited in scope it does not deal with taxation and does not mention the levy", "i shall have to accept my hon friend\u2019s word on that as i always do on everything i have no expertise in the taxation of bingothe bill identifies what might be termed a loophole although it would be better described as an inconsistency companies that locate some of their online business offshore are not regulated taxed or subject to a levy i understand why that inconsistency worries a number of people and i am happy to go along with the proposal to create a level playing fieldas i have said the bill does not at this stage refer to a tax or a levy although it was suggested earlier today probably by more than one speaker that a recent european union ruling was likely to give the government an opportunity to extend the levy to companies that are based offshore that might well bring in more money for horse racing but i accept what was said by my hon friend the member for shipley there have been some estimates of how much money it would bring in which i think may have been exaggeratedmy hon friend was understandably concerned about the smaller bookmaking companies but when it comes to the extra tax and the extra levy i think we should be a little concerned about the larger ones as well because we are talking about a very highly taxed industry as well as the ordinary corporation tax and other taxes that apply to all businesses it is subject to machine games duty and to the general betting tax and levy", "the bookmakers give money to horse racing through picture rights through the levy through voluntary sponsorship of races and indeed through hospitality as my hon friend says the amount of money they put into racing cannot measured just by the levy and we must be careful not to tax them too heavily last week during dcms questions a number of members attacked the socalled clustering and proliferation of betting shops i pointed out that over the last 20 years the number of betting shops has actually halved i am not sure that that can accurately be described as proliferationthe pressures on betting shops and bookmakers have increased as was mentioned earlier the amount of money that certain individual shops make is very small and the number of independent bookmakers has been reduced creating a level playing field should not mean heaping more tax on bookmakers we should view theposition another way yes we should be searching for that level playing field but the level could be a great deal lower than it is at presentrather than imposing a 15 tax on bookmakers who are based offshore should we not try to attract them back onshore by reducing the overall burden of taxation not just for those based abroad but for those in this country it would be rather perverse to impose a 5 tax on those based in gibraltar for example and a 15 tax on those based here the levels should be compatible but lower i fear that imposing a 15 tax on bookmakers based in such places as gibraltar would have a negative effecti mentioned in an intervention that i have been to countries\u2014i am not going to name them\u2014where there is a tote monopoly and it is illegal to bet outside that monopoly and i have sat next to people as they have had illegal bets that is not a clever situation it is not something i was proud to witness but it goes on that is the real worldwe must be careful not to drive businesses from being legitimate and based in gibraltar for example to being based anywhere else in the world and taking bets from this country completely unregulated and without paying a penny in tax or levy that would be the complete opposite of what the government are trying to achieve there would be no protection for consumers and we know the internet is notoriously difficult to regulate that is no fault of this or the previous government it is just what has happeneda few years ago a company called betfair stole a march on the entire betting industry by creating a betting exchange business it was hugely successful and betfair puts a lot of money into racing but that move took the entire country and industry by surprise nobody knew how to compete with or respond to it that is the way of the world however that is the way things are goingthat is the way things have gone in this house too when i arrived here 16 years ago there were no such things as ipads now they can be used in committees and some committees have even gone paperless papers are not circulated and instead they use the ipad which links into the internet things have changed and we do not know how they will change over the next five or 10 years it is difficult to regulate what goes on via the internet and we should not pretend that we can we have to ensure that we do not inadvertently through wellintentioned measures make the situation worsemr deputy speaker i am aware that you are anxious to get on to the next debate so i will not say any more i entirely agree with many of the points made today and i do not want to repeat them i am basically in favour of the bill and a level playing field for taxation levy regulation and customer protection but as the bill proceeds i urge the minister and the government to ensure that we do not inadvertently make the situation worse", "my hon friend is making some excellent points he talked about people being tempted to bet illegally possibly because of the withdrawal of special offers i am sure he is aware because he has greater knowledge of this than me that in several countries there is monopoly betting usually a tote monopoly and it is illegal to bet beyond that yet because the internet is so very difficult to control people in those countries do bet illegally every day all the time", "if a company set up in say china or america and advertised only through the internet would it be covered by the scope of the bill the minister will correct me if i am wrong but i do not think that it would", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government what recent assessment he has made of the use

landlords associations on the viability of landlords being able to accurately assess the legitimacy of applicant tenants in terms of their right of abode in the uk and if she will make a statement", "i am grateful to the minister for pointing out how many thousands of jobs the horse racing industry creates and sustains each and every year the levy is largely collected from bookmakers\u2019 shops the number of which has halved in the last 20 years falling from a peak of about 17000 to 8500 does the minister agree that it is important for us to see the debate about machines and gambling in proportion and for it to be evidencebased so that we do not lose any more shops and as a result jobs in the betting and horse racing industries", "thank you for calling me to speak mr brady it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship and to have served under that of mr havard earlieri thank all the members who have attended westminster hall today and contributed to this very lively debate i thank the minister for his attendance and his answers i am not completely satisfied as he would imagine by some of the answers he has given particularly about this socalled \u201chousing crisis\u201d he said that we are an ageing population of course we will age during the next 20 years but we aged during the past 20 years as well so i am not convinced that the projections should jump up so much because of that single factor of course families go their own separate ways and people unfortunately have divorced but again i am not aware that the projection will go up in the way that it would need to in order to justify the additional housing figures that are being talked aboutthe minister was perhaps talking about people being unable to buy houses and ignoring the financial constraints in my experience it is not necessarily that the houses are not there we went through a situation where some lenders were lending 125 of the house price which had the effect of inflating those house prices now we have the opposite where there is a very tight lending policy and that is making it difficult for people to borrow i accept the philosophy of price elasticity of course\u2014demand and supply\u2014but there is more to it than that so i am a little concerned that the government are still clinging to the \u201chousing crisis\u201d phrasei will rattle through one or two final points i am very much in favour of neighbourhood plans of course but they have to be in conformity with the local plan so they are not actually that valuablemy final point is the one raised by my right hon friend the member for arundel and south downs nick herbert about infrastructure does that mean that numbers can be reduced what about the green belt what about flood risk areas all these provide great difficulties certainly in my constituency to coming up with the sort of numbers that are being proposed by the government\u2014", "the minister used the word \u201ccrisis\u201d but that is not a situation that i recognise i would be grateful if he went into it in a little more detail", "i thank the backbench business committee for granting this debate which has been supported by a large number of concerned members in particular i thank my right hon friend the member for arundel and south downs nick herbert and the hon member for st albans mrs main for sponsoring it along with me there is concern among hon members and local planning authorities about apparent confusion in the government\u2019s planning policies i requested this debate because i want to consider planning the countryside and housing projections as well as related issues such as the government\u2019s professed preference for localism as these matters are all interconnectedprotecting the countryside was one of my main motivations for entering parliament in the first place as i represent the constituency of tewkesbury i am more sensitive than most to the need to avoid developing on or near flood risk areas the terrible 2007 floods in tewkesbury will never be forgotten by anyone who lived through them i spend a lot of time trying to attract businesses visitors and people in general to tewkesbury so i believe that a balance can be struck between allowing appropriate development and protecting our green belt green fields and important open spaces but i am not sure that we are striking that balance at the momentwhat do i mean by confusion in policy the government have said frequently for example that their policy is to preserve greenbelt land yet my local planning authorities\u2014my constituency covers three\u2014are telling me that the government are pressuring them to provide for so many houses in their local plans or joint core strategies that it will inevitably compromise the green belt green fields and flood risk areasin a ministerial statement dated 6 september 2012 the government said\u201cthe green belt is an important protection against urban sprawl providing a \u2018green lung\u2019 around towns and cities the coalition agreement commits the government to safeguarding green belt and other environmental designations\u201dthat seems clear enough however the same statement goes on to say\u201cas has always been the case councils can review local designations to promote growth we encourage councils to use the flexibilities set out in the national planning policy framework to tailor the extent of green belt land in their areas to reflect local circumstances\u201d\u2014official report 6 september 2012 vol 549 c 3334wsthat is less clear indeed it is confusing perhaps even contradictoryon the face of it reaffirming councils\u2019 right to redesignate the status of their land could be seen as promoting localism however the fact is that government pressure to create high housing numbers is forcing such redesignations which flies in the face of localism and contradicts the localism policy the government\u2019s policies on the green belt and the wider countryside are confusing and contradictory clearing up that confusion is one of the purposes of this debate the government\u2019s insistence on high housing numbers is threatening the green belt which leads me to question why the government believe that we need so many houses in the first place i wish to consider the question of housing projectionsi recognise and claim everyone\u2019s right to a decent place to live my job immediately before i was elected to parliament involved working with homeless women in london my responsibility was to raise money to build a hostel and day centre for them to enable them to take the first steps back to normality i learned that in almost all cases homelessness is caused not by a property shortage but by other factors such as finances family breakdown drug or alcohol abuse unemployment refugee status or other social factors it is not that there are not enough housesthe government\u2019s own figures seem to confirm that there is no shortage of houses in an answer to a recent parliamentary question that i tabled the government informed me that at the last count there were 709426 empty properties in england add to that the number of houses with planning permission that are not yet built and the figure for available properties in england comes close to 1 millionof course there are in fact shortages of two kinds of housing affordable homes which are scarce in the village where i live and privately rented properties partly because it is hard and often undesirable to be a landlord there are shortages in those two sectors for reasons other than a shortage of houses as such for example it is getting on for 2 o\u2019clock yet any one of us could go out into london or anywhere else and find houses to buy this afternoon i question the government\u2019s assertion that so many houses need to be built that local authorities must redesignate greenbelt land in order to meet the government\u2019s arbitrary and undefined housing targetstewkesbury is an example of what i mean there is no housing shortage in my area in fact there is planning permission for houses that have not yet been built as well as empty properties in the past 20 years 7536 houses have been completed in the borough of tewkesbury yet the cambridge university econometric assessment which is used by local councils and presumably approved of by the government suggests that 10900 houses will be needed in the borough over the next 20 years\u2014or to be strictly accurate over the next 18 years as two years of the plan period have already passed why has tewkesbury\u2019s housing need for the next 20 years been assessed as 45 higher than for the last 20 years it needs explainingit gets worse tewkesbury borough is involved in drawing up a joint core strategy with cheltenham and gloucester the jcs allocation for tewkesbury borough for the next 20 years is not the 10900 i refer to high though that is but 18800 which is 150 higher than for the last 20 years why partly because it is deemed that cheltenham and gloucester cannot find land fortheir housing growth needs so the houses will be dumped in tewkesbury borough potentially causing housing stock in tewkesbury to increase by 54 over the next 20 years and causing the councils to build on greenbelt land and in other undesirable areasthat raises the question of the duty to cooperate gloucestershire has six council areas not just three and the duty to cooperate goes beyond county boundaries why then will the houses that cheltenham and gloucester are deemed to need but cannot accommodate end up being built on greenbelt land in tewkesbury that cannot be fair and it demonstrates the paucity of the current planning guidance which says that plans will be considered unsound if the councils concerned have not cooperated however it is the councils that are not involved in the plan as well as those that are that need to cooperate how does that worki reiterate that if it were not for the government\u2019s apparent pressure on local authorities to plan for a greater number of houses the problem would not arise such a topdown approach is arbitrary and undefined i say so because that is basically what the government indicated to me in reply to a parliamentary question in a written answer dated 9 july the minister told me\u201cwhile there is no standard methodology councils\u2019 assessments should be demonstrably objective\u201d\u2014official report 9 july 2013 vol 568 c 191wwhat exactly does that mean if there is no standard methodology for assessing future housing needs how can government assessments be right and the local authority\u2019s previous housing figures wrong that is another question that i want answered todaythat brings us to the issue of localism in my view the government were right to scrap the regional spatial strategies it was surely wrong for unelected anonymous people to determine how many houses an area should build and where they should build them it was therefore with great anticipation that i and many others looked forward to the new housing and planning strategy\u2014only so far to be disappointedlocal plans have always had to be sound and developers have always had the right to appeal against decisions against them locally there has also always been a presumption in favour of sustainable development however we now seem to have gone beyond that and to be setting the bar far too high for local planning authorities and that causes them to contradict another area of government policy which is the need to protect the green beltas i have said in my area tewkesbury borough will if the jcs is adopted have to increase its housing stock by about 54 over the next 20 years that massive increase will mean that the council has to grant permission for developers to build thousands of houses on land that is currently designated green belt such sites have already been identified", "the authorities are involved in the joint core strategy which covers three councils but there are six councils in the county and others outside the county overlap with them or are contiguous perhaps there has not been enough of an attempt to ensure that all councils join in and there has been obstinacy on the part of some of those involved in the joint core strategy but whatever the case it is a really strange situation to have three councils getting together while others each have their own plans the whole system is very confusing and difficult as for tewkesbury\u2019s allocation even if we accept the cambridge assessment of 10900 homes we will not have that figure we propose to have 18800 even though we built only 7500 in the previous 20 years the situation is very confusedi have mentioned that there are proposals to build on designated greenbelt sites if they are built on it will bring the coalescence of cheltenham and gloucester nearer but it was precisely to avoid that that the land in question was designated green belt in the first place in line with the policy stated in the written ministerial statement that i read out surely that is not what this conservativeled government intend to happenas i have mentioned the conservative party may i say in the privacy of this room that our policies on planning are losing us many votes in many areas i am sure that the leaders of my party do not intend that to happen in some ways i feel that the government believe that recovery and growth in the economy can be kickstarted by encouraging more house building perhaps that is why the government are requiring such high numbers rather than following assessments based on experience and fact", "i entirely agree i do not believe that it is for the government to engineer a recovery in such a way surely the market will determine in which areas there will or will not be growth so why not leave local councils to determine how many houses they need over any given period and to make their plans accordingly the minister may reply that that is indeed happening but it is not the three council areas i cover have all told me that they have to make plans for a high number of houses because the government will reject plans as unsound if they do not plan for such large numbers if that is wrong i want the minister to say so i will then go back to those councils and tell them that their view is wrong i do not however believe that that is the casethere is certainly a feeling that developers\u2019 ad hoc applications are granted too freely on appeal by the secretary of state i have examples of that in my area appeals have been granted that will allow the building of many houses at bishop\u2019s cleeve and winchcombe against the wishes of local people on the face of it those appeals were allowed because the council has been deemed to have an insufficient fiveyear land supply what is that assessment based on is it based on the number of houses built in the past on some arbitrary and undefined calculation or on figures in the regionalspatial strategy the strategy for the southwest was never signed off and that whole policy has been scrapped in any case once again this practice flies in the face of the localism concept that the government are promotingmany hon members wish to speak so i will summarise my main concerns the government\u2019s policy on the green belt is confused and contradictory and we need clarification today exactly how do the government assess how many houses will be needed in the future why are they following the predictprovide approach why are estimates for future housing need so high and why are they so much higher than what was needed for the last 20 years as a slight aside much of the population growth in the past 20 years has been caused by immigration given that the government are intent on reducing net immigration and claim to have done so already how can housing need be predicted to increase why is the localism agenda being ignored why is pressure being put on local councils causing them to build on greenbelt land all those questions are being asked in the council areas that i represent and most importantly by the constituents i represent and they would all like answers", "i thank the democratic unionist party for today\u2019s two debates both of which are very important i pay great tribute to the right hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson who has been a friend of mine for many years for the way in which he introduced the debate i think that the whole house will have found it extremely moving and very sad when he read out the names ages and family connections of those murdered 20 years ago today\u2014it really reminds us of what a terrible time in northern ireland we have seen i would like to add my sympathies and condolences to all those who survived that attack and lived with the pain of it\u2014it is unimaginable what they went through then and what they are still going throughjust last year i visited enniskillen with the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey for the 25year anniversary commemoration of another terrible atrocity i was in dundalk the day the bomb went off at omagh and have since visited omagh three times i have also met the families in relation to the events at kingsmill and ballymurphy and the finucane murder terrible though those atrocities were it is worth remembering that they all took place some time ago and since then enormous progress has been made in northern ireland\u2014it is very important to remember that we have seen her majesty the queen pay an outstanding historic visit to not only the republic of ireland but to northern ireland when she shook hands with martin mcguinness and many other people we have also seen power sharing and several important events in northern ireland which have been referred to already for example the g8 meeting was held there and londonderry is the city of culture there are many tourism opportunities in northern ireland such as giant\u2019s causeway and the titanic centre\u2014there are very many reasons to go to northern ireland we have seen so many changes even just over the years i have been going thereit is also right to say that challenges remain however there is unfinished business in northern ireland and sadly it is still in some ways a divided society for example there are more peace walls there now than there were 10 years ago which cannot be a good thing there are still dissidents attempting to murder members of the security forces and over the summer and during the flag protests at the end of last year we saw socalled loyalists throwing bricks at police officers that simply cannot be rightmuch has been done but this debate is about dealing with the past how do we deal with the past can we ever do it successfully there has been a call for an inquiry to be held into the omagh atrocity and there are powerful arguments for doing so but there are also people who do not want such an inquiry because it would bring back the pain and rake over the past it would risk prolonging the painperhaps the only way to deal with the past is to build a better future since 2010 the select committee which i have the honour of chairing has been concentrating on the future for example it has been inquiring into and making recommendations on economic matters such as corporation tax and air passenger duty\u2014which we shall discuss in a short while\u2014in an attempt to cement the peace that has been achieved by building a better economy and by giving people greater opportunities and allowing them to feel that the peace process has been worth while for them this is about building a province that is very different for present and future generations from what it was in the pastthe select committee also considers security matters and issues relating to the past for example we are meeting dr richard haass next tuesday to discuss his work we will also be meeting the chief constable and deputy chief constable to discuss the security situation shortly after that we will meet the secretary of state to discuss all those issues and moreone issue that the committee cannot look into in any detail because it is devolved is that of education and schooling i believe however that we need to make more progress on integrated education we need to bring children together at the age of four rather than separating them and allowing them to live separate lives we need to show them that there is no difference between a catholic and a protestant and that what differentiates us is the way we behave rather than the labels that are placed on us", "i accept that the hon lady knows an awful lot about this subject and i accept her point about grammar schools she will also be aware however of the turmoil surrounding the ability of children to qualify to go to those schools i suggest that there is still a need to move the general principle of integrated education forward in the wider sense", "i thank my hon friend for that powerful intervention that point was also raised earlier and i agree entirely i have in fact taken the matter to the very top in that i have said to mr gerry adams and mr martin mcguinness that that is exactly what they should bedoing they should be coming here to argue their case they travel to westminster and hold meetings here in this building but they will not come to the chamber to discuss these issues they are not serving the people of northern ireland very well by pursuing that abstentionist policy almost a third of the province is unrepresented here in this chamber which is a tragedy for the people of northern ireland regardless of whether they are republicans or unionists", "i thank my hon friend for his kind remarks it is true that sinn fein has started to give formal evidence to the select committee and i regard that as progress despite what i just said in response to my hon friend the member for northampton south mr binley i must point out that these things sometimes take a little while there has been progress in that respect as my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport oliver colvile says and i hope that it will continue because i see it as a positive move it is sensible for sinn fein to make that move but there are still a number of steps that it will have to takei was talking about integrated education and i am very keen on that concept i attended a church of england secondary school and i am proud to have done so but i must point out that bolton in lancashire is very different from west belfast\u2014as you will know mr deputy speaker\u2014and presents very different challenges i want to see a society in northern ireland in which peace walls are no longer required and in which we stop counting and publishing the percentages of catholics and protestants in organisations we need to reach a point at which that does not matterwe must move towards a society in which rather than segregating children almost at birth we teach them to live together that is the way to achieve a shared future because a shared future involves sharing institutions and sharing lives the peaceful future that we all want to build in northern ireland will not be secured through treaties or international agreements it will be secured through changing hearts and minds that is something that we must try to work towardsi have mentioned the violence in northern ireland over the summer and at the end of last year i was there during the marches in midjuly and i witnessed many thousands of people celebrating their culture there was not a single problem among all those thousands of people of course as ever the 01 did cause problems and unfortunately those are the pictures that get flashed across the world the select committee visited america a few months ago and the people we spoke to told us how disconcerting it was to see the pictures of the flag protests and of the problems relating to marches we had to point out to them that the problems were due to that 01 of the people unfortunately however those pictures that are flashed across the world lose revenue for northern irelandthey lose us tourists and inward investment and that cannot be right those acts of violence cannot be right whether they are the result of political ambitions related to republicanism or loyalism or the result of pure thuggery which i suggest some of them wereeither way we have to move forward and try to build a better northern ireland so that this generation and future generations do not suffer as those in the past have done in the ways that my right hon friend the member for lagan valley so graphically described earlier to summarise perhaps we can best deal with the past only by building a better future", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will enable landlords to roll over tax relief from one tax year to another and if he will make a statement", "part of the trial is taking place in my constituency my first ministerial meeting when i was elected 16 years ago was with jeff rooker on this very subject and only now is any meaningful action taking place the minister is absolutely right to say that a whole range of measures is needed to counter the disease but it has been increasing and farmers have been suffering we must get a grip on it", "the secretary of state will be aware that the republic of ireland has announced the scrapping of its equivalent of air passenger duty what assessment has the secretary of state made on the impact that could have on airports in northern ireland will she reconsider the northern ireland affairs committee\u2019s proposals that attention should be given to removing the tax on flights to and from northern ireland", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions if he will introduce a scheme whereby rents can be paid on behalf of tenants directly to landlords and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of

quite well they are generous in supporting charity events and many other things on which i commend them the hon gentleman is discussing india\u2019s reputation on which i do not wish to cast any doubt

is important that racing and betting come to a more commercial agreement will he continue to work with both parties to bring about such an agreement", "the leader of the house said that consultant lobbyists will have to register whereas inhouse lobbyists will not and i understand that point may i return to the point made by the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman he asked about large accountancy companies and large firms of solicitors who represent a number of clients and frequently understandably and rightly come to members of parliament and ministers to put forward their point is there not a very fine dividing line between those who will be required to register and those who will not is my right hon friend happy that the person making the judgment on who should have to register could be very easily compromised", "what recent discussions he has had with the indian government on the nonpayment of invoices submitted by satellite information services following its coverage of the 2010 commonwealth games", "the minister will be aware that the report by india\u2019s central bureau of investigation exonerated the company of any criminal wrongdoing over a year ago

very difficult position and will he continue to do everything he can to speed the matter up", "what recent assessment he has made of the takeup of apprenticeships", "i am grateful to the minister for that response as he knows i have a lot of engineering companies in my constituency the largest being ge aviation which has more than 100 apprentices nevertheless those companies find it difficult to

each apprenticeship that is taken up", "i condemn the violence of the past few nights for which as the secretary of state has said there can be no excuse i pay tribute to the brave men and women of the psni who risk their lives every day to try to keep the peace i extend my best wishes to the right hon member for belfast north mr dodds whom i saw on the morning of 12 july at the ardoyne he was doing his best to maintain peace and calm in that area when there was something of a difficult situation seemingly caused by the determination of the parades commissioni was at several other places in belfast on thursday night and on friday with the exception of the ardoyne in the morning among the thousands of people i saw celebrating there was not a single problem does the secretary of state agree that the trouble has been caused by a very few people who were determined to cause trouble from the outset does she agree that those people in no way represent the good and decent people of northern ireland", "on a recent visit to the united states members of the northern ireland affairs committee were told that bad publicity from certain paramilitary organisations in northern ireland would be a deterrent to inward investment there is however a lot of good news in the province so what will the minister do to promote that over and above the very rare occurrences of bad news", "to ask the secretary of state for energy and climate change what his departments policy is on burning wood to create electricity", "it is a pleasure to follow all the right hon and hon members who have spoken so far i intend to make only a brief contribution to the debate as many of the points have already been raised i note that amendment 2 tabled by my hon friend the member for amber valley nigel mills uses the word \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cshall\u201d which is in keeping with the rest of the clause that he is seeking to amend the select committee feels that we should move forward in this respect and that we should try to normalise politics in northern ireland i know that that was the ambition of the previous secretary of state and the previous minister and it is fair to say that it is also the ambition of the current holders of those positions it has been our guiding principle each and every political party that the committee spoke to during the course of the inquiry approved of moving towards greater transparencyeveryone on the committee myself included recognises that there is a different security situation in northern ireland the committee has had a sufficient number of meetings and paid a sufficient number of visits to northern ireland to understand that fact further to my earlier intervention on the right hon member for belfast north mr dodds a question that has frequently been asked is why should the arrangements be different for donors and for those who participate in the elections the right hon gentleman gave an explanation for why people might want to be donors but not candidates and i understand that but i am still not clear why a donor should be at greater risk or under a greater threat than someone who is standing for office for a political party i would have thought that it was the other way round people who support a candidate largely by signing nomination papers would surely expose themselves to the same riskit has been pointed out that if a business makes a donation it could put them at a commercial disadvantage but it is up to the business to make that decision there is a cooperative store close to my office in tewkesbury the coop has supported the labour party for many years and i have to make the decision whether to go and buy a carton of milk and a newspaper from that shop it happens to be close to my office and very convenient so i do that i do not think that businesses should be able to hide behind the argument of a security risk in order to protect their business interests if they make a donation to a particular party in northern ireland or elsewhere in great britain they should take that commercial risk that should be part of the normal run of politicsi am somewhat intrigued by the substantive clause inasmuch as it allows the secretary of state to increase transparency but does not allow her to reduce it having looked very closely at the provisions i am still slightly confused on this point if the secretary of state increases transparency can she reduce it at some later date in other words she cannot reduce transparency from where it stands now but can she reduce it if she has increased it in the futurei make that point because if she cannot reduce it where have we got to what would be the difference from what my hon friend the member for amber valley proposes let us say that the secretary of state increases transparency but in the year after that the security situation\u2014heaven forbid\u2014got worse so that she had to come back to introduce primary legislation to change that position in those circumstances i do not really see what would be any different from my hon friend\u2019s proposalthe select committee and i would certainly be against the publication of any information retrospectively when donors have made donations in the belief that that would not be the case i am slightly concerned about the wording in clause 1 however where it states\u201csuch information may be disclosed if the commission believe on reasonable grounds that\u2026the relevant person has consented\u201dwe tried to strengthen that provision saying that there had to be evidence that the person had consented the government response was that if they adopted our proposal it would create an absolute offence and a mistake could be made i am not completely persuaded by that argument i think that the clause does need strengthening to ensure that a mistake cannot be made in this respect and that there has to be a clear indication from the person or organisation that made the donation that permission has been given for any such disclosure i thus seek clarification from the minister on those points", "the right hon gentleman is making a number of very important points a number of the committee\u2019s witnesses where asked why donors would be at greater risk than candidates for example or those who support candidatesin other ways perhaps by delivering leaflets displaying posters canvassing or signing the nomination papers why does he think that donors would be at greater risk that those participants", "to ask the attorneygeneral what advice he has given to ministerial colleagues on the release of private correspondence between hon members and their constituents which have been forwarded by hon members to ministers following a subsequent request made under the freedom of information act 2000", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government if he will take steps to extend part m regulations to extensions to buildings and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government what his most recent estimate is of the number of houses for which planning permission has been granted but which are not yet built in a england and b gloucestershire", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government how many local plans have been rejected by his departments inspectors on the basis of providing insufficient housing numbers since may 2010 and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government what criteria and evidence his departments inspectors use when assessing the appropriate housing provision for an area when considering local plans which have been submitted for approval and if he will make a statement", "as chairman of the northern ireland committee i congratulate the democratic unionist party on taking a very clear stance on this issue the right hon gentleman refers to the 1975 referendum does he remember that the brochure put out by the then labour government \u201cbritain\u2019s new deal in europe\u201d contained a guarantee that a british minister could veto anything that came from europe at that time what this is really all about is the erosion of that guarantee through qualified majority voting", "this debate is not about what kind of trade union laws we should have it is about who makes those laws the hon gentleman referred to young boys going up chimneys but that practice was ended not by the european union but by this parliament just as slavery was abolished by this parliament and as women were given the vote by this parliament", "to ask the secretary of state for justice what proportion of people convicted of burglary offences were given custodial sentences in each of the last five years for which figures are available", "it is a pleasure mr havard to serve under your chairmanship i want to declare a nondeclarable interest i am chairman of the allparty group on ethiopia which keeps me very busy and is extremely rewarding i thank my right hon friend the member for gordon sir malcolm bruce and congratulate him on how he introduced the debate i pay tribute to him and the select committee on their report i am not a member of the committee but i chair the select committee on northern ireland affairs so i know how much work goes into inquiries and putting reports together select committee reports are often influential and i have absolutely no doubt that this one will beit is probably fair to say that when i was elected to this place 16 years ago international development overseas aid or whatever it was called at the time had a profile largely because of the work of baroness chalker who was linda chalker at the time it is also fair to say that it has taken off during the past 16 years and its profile has increased i am happy to pay tribute to the work carried out by tony blair in that respect and by clare short who worked with him and with whom i recently shared a platform it is a pleasure that the government under the prime minister\u2019s particular leadership have taken forward the international development agenda and as my right hon friend said taken on cochairmanship of the new panel that is responsible for delivering achievement of the millennium development goals beyond 2015 the issue is talked about throughout the world it has its own place in parliaments and is extremely important the g8 always discusses the matter and i am pleased that it has been recognised as one of the most important issues in the world today i would put it up there with the environment as the two most important issues facing the world todayi am pleased that the government have at last moved us to a figure of 07 of gdp on aid although i am the first to say that it is outcomes rather than what one spends that matters i have in the past been a little sceptical about setting targets and the conservative party went into the last election saying that it would get rid of many targets they can be manipulated as my right hon friend said\u2014he did not use the word \u201cmanipulate\u201d\u2014and may take us down a path that is easy but does not achieve muchi approve of the setting of millennium development goals because that focuses the government and the world on what we should start to achieve the 07 figure is a target that we have achieved but we must measure properly as my right hon friend highlighted it is easy to make important the things that we can measure while forgetting things that are not easy to measure but are more importantno one who has been to africa\u2014that is the area i focus on most\u2014and seen how people live there can come back and complain about the fact that we are trying to help those people and those countries it is devastating to see the effect of starvation disease poverty and linked to them lack of education and health care people tell me that pensioners in this country suffer fuel poverty\u2014indeed they do and they need help\u2014but our country is rich enough to do both things a lot of government spending is wasted and we could channel more money into helping people such as our own pensioners who often live in fuel poverty while also helping people who live in thirdworld countriesthere was an example of that just last week we spend \u00a311 billion or \u00a3115 billion in aid but in one day last week the potential cost of hs2 went up by almost that amount that is what i mean when i talk about being able to help our own people who need it and people abroad who are dying of diseases and malnutrition a world of plenty that throws food away as we do should be ashamed of that and i am pleased that we are at last tackling the problem as seriously as we shouldi support emergency aid and relief and i have seen examples of such provision being necessary in ethiopia where every year about 6 million people rely on food donations", "my right hon friend is absolutely right i was talking to bob geldof at the irish embassy a while ago and when he asked me what got me interested in ethiopia i said \u201cyou did\u201d he did an enormous and unbelievable amount of work and if any one person put the issue on the agenda it was him i should have mentioned him earlier some people say that that work set ethiopia back because it is a wonderful place for tourists to visit but they will not do so because of the poverty\u2014there is probably something in that\u2014but we cannot ignore what goes on there and that people were starving to death although things have moved on considerably in ethiopia each and every year about 6 million people there still do not have food security and are dependent on assistance i am certainly in favour of emergency relief and of development aid which is important in helping countries develop infrastructure irrigation systems and other things that will help them move towards selfsufficiency over a period of timemy right hon friend is also right to talk about trade and employment which will enable people to become better off over the last few years each time i have gone to ethiopia i have noticed renewed confidence in its economy and in business which appear to have moved on a little since each previous visit that is encouraging but i do not want to overstate the situation and an awful lot remains to be done to move forward properly ethiopia must free up its telecoms business its banking and financial services sector and the ownership of land an awful lot needs to be done but there is progressmany countries need confidence in democracy and the private sector to enable them to move forward a little quicker but many of them have brief histories ethiopia has a long history of about 2000 years that we know about but it does not have a long history of democracy and that is how we must view it in some ways everything is relative we still get elections wrong in this country even today so we should not be too judgmental about other countriesin response to my intervention my right hon friend put his finger on the difficult problem of measuring and chasing certain aspects of progress often the poorest people\u2014those who are most desperate\u2014live in the sort of countries that it is difficult to get aid to in one form or another and where it is difficult to help them towards development with somalia being the most obvious example however we have to work and do our best\u2014almost by going under the radar\u2014to get aid assistance and help to people who we do not know or have contactwith but who are the most desperate of all doing so is difficult but anything worth doing is never easy i hope that we will continue trying to help such people and continue trying to work with countries in africa and the heads of those countries as we are doing to take them towards peace again as the right hon member for gordon said we cannot measure this but i hope we can help them to avoid conflict in the first place that is far better than going in to sort it out which is not always possiblei do not want to speak for much longer i know that another debate is coming up again i congratulate the members involved on compiling the report to me this area is one of the main reasons that i entered politics in the first place i will be in the house tomorrow supporting the european union referendum bill and i am a complete free marketeer i am considered to sit on the right wing of the conservative party even though such terms are nonsense because most people would follow me in what i will say and do tomorrow however when it comes to international development we have a moral duty to do what needs to be done in addition we should not forget that the better off we can make countries throughout the world the more secure that makes this country and the more opportunities it gives us in this country from a purely selfish point of view there is a benefit to what we are doing to my mind however that is not the main reason for doing it the main reason is that it is humane and it is the right thing to do", "at the beginning of my right hon friend\u2019s speech i think he said that there has been a lack of progress in a number of the countries with which the uk is most engaged will he give us a few details on why that might be the case", "what recent progress has been made on reform of the common agricultural policy", "i am grateful to my right hon friend for that answer and congratulate him on his work at the council will he enlighten the house on what those regressive measures were because my farmers remain very concerned that they will be worse off as a result of some of the changes compared with their continental competitors", "the secretary of state has expressed his concern recently about the use of cautions for people who commit burglary what progress has he made on strengthening sentences particularly for those who have been convicted of burglary because it remains a serious offence", "to ask the secretary of state for energy and climate change for what reason the green deal computer software will not make a recommendation for insulating a timber frame wall in the energy performance certificate and if he will make a statement", "thank you mr amess this has indeed been an interesting debate and we have covered all the relevant issues that are very important to northern ireland i thank everyone who has spoken and i thank the minister for his comprehensive responsei talked about competing with the republic of ireland or with dublin i should put on the record that as well as chairing the select committee i cochair the britishirish parliamentary assembly so i meant competition in a very friendly way the irish government support reducing corporation tax to 125 in northern ireland so i speak about such competition on the basis of cooperationit would be helpful if the minister came back to me on my specific point about railway access to airport terminals and we can take it from therei entirely agree with the points made particularly by the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey about eu interference on air passenger duty and landing slots we should make our own decisions in this country and perhaps we will be doing so by the end of 2017the minister spoke about the reasons for apd of which there are two one is to raise tax and the other relates to green issues on those green issues if we overtax our airlines we will not reduce the number of flights or save the world people will just fly from somewhere else that is the point we have been trying to get acrosson the time scale i have some sympathy with the government because airport capacity in the southeast should have been sorted out long ago by the previous labour government but we need to speed up the process i am concerned about how long it will take for the review for action to be taken and then for building work to be completed northern ireland might lose an awful lot of jobs while that is going on and i am very concerned about thatlet us say that the recommendation is made next year and that it is for a third runway from a political point of view if the lib dems do not like that they can go into the election saying that they will not pursue that option and we can go into it saying that we will i do not see what is wrong with that we will get to the point before the next election at which we disagree on several issues with the lib dems\u2014and with the labour party\u2014and we will all go into the election putting forward our own viewsi would be nervous about going into the election and saying to the electorate \u201ci\u2019m sorry we have no policy\u201d this is a political point\u2014you may rule me out of order in a minute mr amess\u2014but i would have a problem about going into the election and saying to my constituents \u201ci\u2019m sorry i don\u2019t have a clue what we should do in the southeast\u201d i will not be doing that i will be putting forward a very definite view i want to impress on the minister the importance of that pointthe debate has been very valuable we have made our points to the minister i have known him for many years and i know that he will go away take those points on board and do his absolute utmost to help the people of northern ireland it has been a privilege to lead this debate as i have said the very important thing to do in northern ireland is to rebalance the economy and one way to help do so is by securing the aviation that enables people to travel not just to the mainland but to the continent and to the growing markets that are emerging throughout the worldquestion put and agreed tositting adjourned", "could i ask for clarification on something we were told by the city of derry airport that uk guidelines are that\u201crailway access to airport terminals can only be justified when passenger numbers reach 10 million per annum\u201ddoes the minister know\u2014perhaps he can write to me if he needs to find out\u2014whether that is a devolved or a reserved matter", "i hear what the minister says but the problem is that when the report comes out it will not be the end of the story everything then has to be negotiated and then something has to be agreed and built so let us say that in 2015 a third runway at heathrow is recommended when does the minister estimate it would be operational", "if an additional airport is not in labour\u2019s plans at all the hon gentleman must be sympathetic to the idea of a third runway at heathrow", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again mr amess i thank the liaison committee for nominating this important debate and the minister of state department for transport my right hon friend the member for chelmsford mr burns for attending i know that he had a busy night last night not necessarily helped by some who are in the chamber today i welcome himthis debate comes on the back of the first report of 201213 by the select committee on northern ireland affairs which we published last november i am grateful to all committee members for the work that they carried out on this detailed inquiry and to our officials who are a bit thin on the ground today although i am sure\u2014at least i hope\u2014that quality will make up for the lack of quantityi am grateful to the many witnesses whom we interviewed during the course of our inquiry into the air transport strategy for northern ireland we talked to representatives of the airports the cbi the airline companies travel companies the consumer council for northern ireland unions the uk border agency ministers the federation of small businesses and otherssince the committee was reformed after the last general election we have concentrated on trying our best to move towards a rebalancing of the northern ireland economy we know that northern ireland has become somewhat overdependent on the public sector and we are well aware of the reasons why there is a large deficit in the amount of government spending in northern ireland relative to the amount of tax raised there the same is true in scotland and wales of course but it is more pronounced in northern ireland wages are also lower in northern ireland and there is great concern about people who perhaps do not feel that they have had the full benefits of the peace process we as a committee have considered security issues from time to time of course and we will do so again but we are doing our best to encourage and work with the government and make proposals about how we might rebalance the economy in northern ireland it is obviously worth doing for its own sake so that people in the province can enjoy greater prosperity but we also see it as a way to cement the relative peace achieved over the past 15 years or soour first inquiry after the last general election was on the level of corporation tax we recommended that the issue be devolved to the northern ireland assembly so that it could set a rate that would be more competitivewith the current tax rate in the republic of ireland corporation tax in the uk is 23 but only 125 in the republic although the committee was certainly not unanimous on that proposal we felt that it would help the economy in northern ireland move towards where we want it to be we are debating aviation policy not corporation tax but i will talk about tax a little lateri must stress the importance of air travel to northern ireland it is an island off an island\u2014a beautiful place but nevertheless slightly remote the only way that people there can travel reasonably quickly and efficiently either to the mainland or to the continent is by air the sea crossing is lovely but it is quite slow interruption i do not know whether the minister is thinking of extending high speed 2 to northern ireland but i am sure that it would be welcome if he did however as at the moment there are no plans to do so we must stress how important air travel is to people in northern ireland for social family and business reasons", "i thank the hon lady for her helpful intervention i am sure that the minister travels to northern ireland regularly but it sounds like an invitation for him to do so in a different waywhen the minister gets there he will see that the rail links in northern ireland are not what we might want either particularly between city of derry airport and belfast i will come to that issue in a minute it is a long and sometimes difficult journey northern ireland members sometimes have to leave parliament early in the day\u2014not in the morning of course but not too late in the afternoon\u2014if they want to get back that evening which may explain why they are sometimes unable to take part in debates such as thisthe background is that we have three airports in northern ireland belfast international sometimes known as aldergrove belfast city nowadays named george best belfast city airport after the great footballer and of course city of derry airport belfast international airport has about 4 million passengers a year belfast city airport 24 million and city of derry 400000 when we compare that with dublin which has 90 million passengers a year we see a big difference between the two but belfast international airport is busy and fulfils a completely different role from belfast city airport both are important city of derry airport could probably be used more especially this year when londonderry is the city of culturein terms of connectivity it is extremely important that we retain capacity in the southeast of england because many people fly from belfast to london and then on to other cities in the world there is some concern about the speed with which we are moving inthat direction the committee expressed frustration about how long it is taking for the government to decide whether we are to have for example a further runway at heathrow boris island or something else it is of some concern to the committee that the government seem to have ruled out a third runway at heathrow before commissioning the davies report", "that is extremely helpful given that we have less than two years to go in this parliament before the third runway is a possibility i cannot speak for the committee on that\u2014we did not express a view whether there should be a third runway at heathrow\u2014but we did say that we are concerned about how long it is taking the government\u2019s response to our report said reasonably that they do not want to rush matters they want to consider the issue in depth and detail and to get it right i fully understand that but we feel that we are losing out to dublin paris and schiphol due to the delayit is important to northern ireland that we secure the routes from belfast to london airports a while ago british airways\u2014or the international airlines group to be more correct\u2014took over bmi and there was some concern about whether the route would be discontinued we interviewed willie walsh of international airlines group who was helpful to the committee and stressed the importance of that route to british airways we are concerned that the longhaul routes appear to be more profitable for some airline companies he said that ba was not in a position necessarily to buy an awful lot more planes that could fly longhaul so the route from belfast was valuable to it that is a slightly negative way of getting to the position that we wanted to get to and we must stress the particular importance to the people in northern ireland and to its economy of the routes from belfast to londonrecently we had a bit of a scare when flybe announced that it was ending flights from belfast city airport to gatwick although it ended a number of flights to gatwick not just from belfast the good news is that easyjet has taken over and assures us that that route is important for it all these things are worrying and are a problem for people in northern ireland because air transportation is so important to themlinked to the issues i have mentioned are the slots particularly at heathrow which is under such enormous pressure we want to move the situation on as quickly as we can we discussed the possibility of ringfencing certain slots particularly at heathrow but as the government correctly responded it is difficult to do that under eu law and tends to distort competition and the free market as an avowed freemarketeer i havesome difficulty with that the slots are probably best secured by creating extra capacity in the southeast and we are in a vicious circle in that respecti now return to tax air passenger duty a while ago it became obvious to the committee that continental airlines now operating under united airlines\u2014the only company flying from belfast directly to newark in the united states\u2014was seriously considering ending its only flight because of the high level of longhaul air passenger duty we have since had discussions with that airline in the united states it was a closerun thing it was seriously considering ending that flight because it did not feel that it could pass on the air passenger duty to the customers owing to the proximity of dublin four people travelling from belfast to newark would pay \u00a3260 in tax whereas from dublin i think the charge is \u20ac3 each and there was talk of abolishing that because of the possibility of a short journey elsewhere belfast was in danger of losing outwe did a quick report and put an awful lot of pressure on the government to do something about this to be fair to the treasury the department for transport and the northern ireland office\u2014i do not know exactly who took the decision i suspect it was the treasury\u2014", "the treasury is allpowerful the level of air passenger duty was reduced to that for shorthaul flights and the government have since devolved decisions on air passenger duty to the assembly so it can decide how it wants to play it that reduction saved that route i pay tribute in particular to the select committee members from northern ireland who put pressure on me as chairman allowing me to put pressure on the government we saved that route but it was a closerun thing that demonstrates how important\u2014how big an issue\u2014air passenger duty isokay we saved that route and that is important given the relationship with america but 985\u2014the vast majority\u2014of northern ireland passengers take shorthaul flights many witnesses cited air passenger duty as a major problem and a major cost particularly for people who travel an awful loti have made mild criticism of the government so far they inherited a massive deficit from the previous government and as we saw yesterday it is difficult to cut taxes at this moment we fully understand that however i stress to the minister\u2014although we are glad that the transport minister is present and we know that three ministers cannot be here we could have done with a treasury and a northern ireland minister here too\u2014that air passenger duty is important i hope that he takes that message back to the treasury to see what can be done to lower this burden on the people of northern irelandthe committee also considered visas and tourism which is important to northern ireland and indeed to the republic of ireland of course the republic of ireland the united kingdom the channel islands and the isle of man are not in schengen but in what is known as the common travel area although that ishelpful people coming from other countries to ireland\u2014it is a bit more complicated than this\u2014may need a further visa to get into the united kingdom and vice versaagain the government agreed with our recommendation and are already acting to have discussions with the government of the republic of ireland to see if this situation can be made simpler obviously there has to be a uniform security policy surrounding the common travel area if we go down that route but we encourage the government in that regard of course the island of ireland is promoted as one destination in respect of tourism there is nothing wrong with that even for unionists like me it is sensible however we feel that there can be more simplicity with regard to travelling to both the uk and irelandi thank the committee for all its hard work in compiling this report i hope that i have stressed the importance of rebalancing the economy in northern ireland and of the role that air transport plays in that", "there are of course two issues here one is whether this particular assembly term should be extended and then whether we should move to fiveyear terms the right hon gentleman puts a logical case for having fiveyear terms but surely the assembly did not need to be extended in this term i think that was probably the more important point we were making", "i thank the government for putting the bill out to prelegislative scrutiny analysing it was an interesting task for the northern ireland affairs committee i thank the secretary of state and minister of state for taking on board a number of our recommendations and for considering the other points that we made i thank all members of the committee many of whom are present in the chamber for their hard work and for the benefit of their experience particularly of those who are from northern irelandi do not want to single out one political party that gave evidence to the committee but it demonstrates the considerable extent to which things have moved on in northern ireland that the formal evidence session that we held in belfast with sinn fein was as i understand it the first time that that political party had given public evidence to a committee of the house of commons i think that is a significant step forward i thank all the witnesses who gave evidence to the committee in belfast and in westminster as those on the front benches have said things in northern ireland have moved on enormously", "i agree entirely it is sometimes a case of two steps forward and one step back i was in belfast this morning and the newspapers were full of that incident in which a person was injured two weeks ago members of the committee visited washington and spoke to a number of people there was an overwhelming feeling that much had been sorted out in northern ireland but the incident at the weekend flag protests and the murder of mr david black last november do nothing to attract investment they deter investment and that is a tragedy i hope we can move forward more smoothlywe made a great deal of progress in attracting sinn fein to give evidence to the committee i would go further and say as we did at the time that it is time that members of that party took their seats in this parliament so that they can come and make their case here they claim they do the job anyway but they do not they do a job but they do not do the job of parliamentarians even though they accept the expenses and allowances that go with it we ought to be able to move forward a little more in that respect", "everybody has to observe the law the law cannot be applied differently to different people regardless of who they purport to represent so i do not disagree with a word the hon gentleman has saidwe are in a better place than we were as the secretary of state said it is a welcome change to be considering legislation relating to northern ireland that is not a desperately urgent response to a terrible incident on at least a couple of occasions while i have been a member the house has been recalled during the recess to consider such a matter urgently it is right to move things forward in a more measured way if possible the committee looked at the bill in great detail and supports much of what it proposes i will discuss three or four issues in my speech which will be fairly briefon donations the committee welcomes the move towards normalisation the objective has to be to move northern ireland towards being a normal society and a normal democracy we have some way to go but we are slowly getting there we felt that we ought to move quickly from october 2014 to full publication of who has made donations we understand that there is a security issue a number of witnesses and members of the committee said that there is a risk for people who stand for parliament assembly or council for those who support them by delivering leaflets canvassing or putting up posters and for those who sign nomination papers the question was whether donating money constitutes a different risk we were not persuaded that it does so we want to see greater progress on the publication of donationswe said though that those decisions had to be taken in the light of the security situation we wanted the bill to state that the secretary of state should consult the respective security services before taking such a decision but she has decided not to include that i mention that because although we recognise that there are problems in principle we want to move towards a more normal politics in northern ireland in which there is less suspicion and if everything is out in the open surely that is a better way forward than the way we have been going so far we also insisted however that anyone or any organisation that made donations prior to the change or notification that those donations would become public should remain anonymous because when they gave those donations they depended on that anonymitywe support the ending of dual mandates in fact we would go further as has been alluded to already we think that members of the assembly should not also be members of the house of lords the european parliament or the senate in the republic of ireland i understand fully the points made by the right hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson who has left the chamber momentarily about how important it was at the time for experienced politicians to take the peace process forward in northern ireland\u2014that was certainly essential \u2014but we have moved on before the assembly was restarted many decisions about northern ireland were taken upstairs in committee by statutory instrument which was a very unsatisfactory way of governing northern irelandas conservative frontbench spokesperson i attended many of those sessions the right hon member for wythenshawe and sale east paul goggins was often the minister because many northern ireland members had the additional burden of advancing the peace process in their constituencies many were the times when throughno fault of their own not a single one of them could attend and these were committees deciding very important things for northern ireland it was very unsatisfactory but we have moved on and people cannot be in two places at once there is also the potential for a conflict of interest if somebody sits on two legislative bodies we would have gone further than the government and we would also apply the same rules to scotland and wales although i think that wales is moving in that direction anywaythe select committee welcomed the changes to the appointment and tenure of the justice minister\u2014we feel that the ministry should be more secure\u2014and the fact that taking the position will count against the number of ministries a party can hold but we are a little concerned about what will happen if agreement cannot be reached we urge the government to seek a way forward when that happens could the justice minister be appointed another way without bringing everything down the appointment of the justice minister under a d\u2019hondt system might be possible although i understand the sensitivities around that nevertheless we identified that as a potential problem it has not happened and i hope it never will but there is a potential problemwe disagreed with the government over delaying the next assembly elections to 2016 we think that people in northern ireland are perfectly capable of voting in two or even three elections where necessary and who is to say that the general election will be held in may 2015 we have legislated for it\u2014although i voted against it\u2014but who is to say that the coalition will last that long it might do but who is to say that elections will come in neat fiveyear terms after that it might be the case but it might not so we did not see the need to change that arrangement although we accepted that it was not necessarily the main part of the billwe held many discussions about government and opposition and a number of witnesses said that they wanted to see an opposition developing in northern ireland i think i am representing the committee\u2019s views accurately here but it is certainly my own view that we have to allow the politicians and the people of northern ireland to come forward with their own proposals and solutions to the situation the assembly was created in the way it was for a reason and we all know what that reason was we must bear in mind the good friday agreement requirements for a shared future and it is difficult to come up with a solution to the problem we recognise that there is an issue but we feel that the solution ought to be home grown and brought to this house in the form of a proposalwe hold a similar view on the size of the assembly this is not so much about the fact that 108 assembly members represent 18 million people it is more about the fact that there are six members of the assembly for every westminster constituency again we know why that was done\u2014it made the maths easier at the time\u2014but things can move on we should not throw away the principles of the belfast agreement but i do not see why we cannot with consent move forward on certain aspects of itthat is a collection of some of the select committee\u2019s thoughts i should like to thank all the members of the committee for their work and for their proposals and to thank the government for listening to what we have had to say i wish the bill well", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions what assessment he has made of

hon member for belfast north mr dodds i thank the hon member for gedling vernon coaker for introducing this welcome debate i strongly approve of the balanced wording of the motion which recognises how much progress northern ireland has made during the last 15 years while recognising that more work needs to be done as well as the politicians in this place it is the local politicians but especially the people of northern ireland who have made that progress over many years they have shown enormous resolve in the face of a desperately difficult time i pay tribute to the ordinary people of northern ireland for everything that they have done and for being so resolute in their determination to come through very difficult timesprobably everyone in the house today will remember the deeply difficult times of the 1970s last november i had the rather sad occasion with the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey to visit enniskillen to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the bomb there i was in the republic on 15 august 1998 when the omagh bomb went off and i was in the republic when david black was murdered and i remember the revulsion that was felt in the republic of ireland at those events that demonstrates that we stand together with the taoiseach and the government of southern ireland in condemning these acts and in being determined to find a way forward towards greater peace and a lasting peace in northern irelandi also remember many great things from my regular visits to northern ireland over many years now the hon member for gedling mentioned the wonderful attractions there including the giant\u2019s causeway and the visitors centre there i am sure the hon member for north antrim ian paisley welcomes the new golf course that is to be built in that area at long last he probably says but at least it is on its way for londonderry to be the city of culture this year is a tremendous accolade as has been mentioned the titanic quarter has been open for a year and i have had the pleasure of visiting it twice what a wonderful visit it makes for the g8 is coming to northern ireland to accommodate all the visitors who have been mentioned northern ireland has some of the best hotels in the world which perhaps is not recognised or remembered as well as meeting the people of northern ireland one of the great pleasures of visiting the province is to stay in its wonderful hotels there is an awful lot to be proud of and to look forward to in northern irelandi have the honour of chairing the northern ireland affairs committee and one of the ways that we think will cement the relative peace that has been attained in northern ireland is to try to help the economy and move it to better times as has been mentioned the economy throughout the united kingdom is difficult it is difficult throughout europe it is difficult in various parts of the world for the record i for one believe that the government are on the right track in trying to put the economy right we are not in a mess because we did not spend enough money but because the previous government spent too much money we cannot getaway from that the government are right to try to rebalance the economy in the way that they arebut with specific reference to northern ireland there are one or two issues that we should discuss here today that have been touched upon i have just complimented the government but i will make a mild criticism now i do not think that it is right to delay the decision on devolving responsibility for setting corporation tax until after the scottish referendum i see no relevance at all in fact i think that people in scotland would be somewhat encouraged to vote to remain in the union if we could demonstrate that there is flexibility to do different things in different parts of the united kingdomnorthern ireland is the only part of the united kingdom that shares a land border with another country and the circumstances there are different i certainly congratulate the government on their reduction in the rate of corporation tax and look forward to the downward trend continuing to 20 but we must remember that the level of corporation tax in the republic of ireland is still only 125 if we want to know the importance of that rate to the republic of ireland we need only look back to the financial difficulties it had a couple of years ago when this parliament tried to help even with all its difficulties and despite pressure from the european union it stuck to that rate and would not budge because it knew that it was the best thing it had for attracting inward investment the government need to speed up their decision on whether to devolve the rate of corporation tax to the assemblyon air passenger duty great progress has been made i hope that the select committee was influential\u2014i think that it was\u2014in enabling the rate for longhaul flights from northern ireland to be reduced and giving the assembly responsibility for it however a large number of flights to and from northern ireland are shorthaul and we feel that more work needs to be done in that regard because the relatively high percentage of tax for shorthaul fares is a disincentive i know that that applies across the united kingdom but northern ireland is different as the only realistic way to travel between to and from great britain is by air so much more thought needs to be put into thatthe third matter i want to mention in relation to the northern ireland economy is laundering and smuggling historically a lot of money has been lost in taxation through laundering and smuggling particularly of fuel and tobacco the select committee looked at that in great detail and was horrified by a number of things first how much money is lost and secondly how few custodial sentences are given to criminals who abuse the system to such an extent it is not a victimless crime because it is taking money away from hospitals schools and police forces and from the taxpayers who contribute the money in the first place the committee was also concerned about the small progress made on developing technology that would greatly reduce although not entirely prevent the amount of fuel that can be smuggled and counterfeited in northern ireland i urge the government to continue their work and increase the intensity of their talks with her majesty\u2019s revenue and customs to move towards a better system for eradicating what is a very serious and costly crimei will detain the house no longer as i am well aware of the number of members who wish to speak i look forward to hearing what they have to say i finish byechoing what has been said i think that all of us in this house are looking to create a northern ireland that is far better for the next generation

basically against abortion in principle\u2014is that i want to touch on one or two aspects of the issue one of which is late abortions i remember doing a fundraising project for a special care baby unit in 1992 in derbyshire even as long ago as that babies were starting to survive after 24 weeks\u2019 gestation i saw those babies their fight for life and the care and attention that they were given the entire unit was there to help preserve life and it struck me as very wrong especially as time has gone on and as medical science has advanced that we should be aborting babies who are capable of lifewe have heard it said today that babies cannot survive at 20 or 21 weeks i shall not argue with that position but it is fairly well established that they can survive from anything above 22 weeks and certainly at 23 or 24 weeks it is not fit for a civilised society to take live from the womb babies who are capable of life leave them to struggle for life and let them die in any other circumstances allowing a baby to die like that through omission would certainly be manslaughter at least that cannot be right i can understand why some people might be in favour of abortion up to 12 weeks or so but i simply cannot understand how anybody in this house would want this practice to continue", "i find that intervention rather confusing because if the babies are surviving surely that is proof of the science if the hon lady will forgive me i cannot understand the point of the interventionthe hon member for sunderland central julie elliott asked why we were having the debate now when we considered the issue four years ago i have to say that parliament does not always get things right on very many issues public opinion and the evidence are way ahead of where parliament is examples include welfare reform immigration and the european union parliament has not caught up with what everyone else in the country is saying on those issues this is one such issue that certainly needs to be revisited my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire is right we should not shy away from this subject or any other because if we\u2014", "certainly i shall make one final point then we sometimes hear that it is only vulnerable teenagers who get pregnant and need an abortion that simply is not true 29 of abortions are carried out on women over the age of 30 entirely for social reasons the number of repeat abortions is in the thousands in the past year 76 women had had seven abortions before the one that they were then having there are very many issues there i shall certainly respect your request for me to wind up my remarks mr crausby but this is a very serious issue and i hope that parliament revisits it very soon", "would the hon gentleman like to refer to the british veterinary association\u2019s opinion as well", "rose \u2014", "it is important to recognise the wider context in gloucestershire one of the trials was going to take place in my constituency and farmers are very disappointed that it cannot go ahead for the moment one of the first ministerial meetings that i had in this house 15 years ago was with the then agriculture minister jeff rooker

will it happen", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for south northamptonshire andrea leadsom on securing this debate and on a comprehensive speechwe are coming to the end of the debate and a lot of what i should have liked to say has been said the only thing that i disagree with a little bit is the idea that we are in any way going to reform the european union we can tinker here and there but we cannot achievefundamental reform of the eu partly because as my hon friend the member for stone mr cash said the other member states are simply not interested the whole project is not about subsidiarity at all or about recognising and respecting the rights of sovereign states it is about evercloser union that is its objective because of that we will not achieve the kind of reform that we would likethat is not to say that while we are in the eu we should not try for reform i am delighted that the right hon member for north shropshire mr paterson was promoted in the reshuffle because i worked with him a lot in northern ireland and know that he is the sort of man to take on the department for environment food and rural affairs and more importantly to take on the eu because it is in that department that the eu has its worst effects there is a chance for some change there but overall i do not see us creating the kind of eu that we want so we have to go for an inout referendummy

in business and politics\u2014and neither have my constituentswhen the conservative party went into the previous general election it said that it wanted to connect people again with politics\u2014with

those who have taken part in the debate and made interesting and useful contributions i pay tribute to the members of the northern ireland affairs committee who have attended the hon member for north antrim ian paisley has been present for most of it and of course we heard from my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport oliver colvile who raised a number of issues but i thank everyone who participateda comment was made that no northern ireland members of parliament are members of bipa the hon member for belfast south dr mcdonnell is amember of bipa but as a member of the northern ireland assembly i shall certainly take up that point when we next meetmy hon friend the member for north dorset mr walter pointed out that neither he nor i nor many other members necessarily have a direct connection with either northern ireland or the republic of ireland that is true so why do we get involved well we get involved because we care we care about northern ireland we care about the republic of ireland and we care about the relationships we have the only reason we are involved is our commitment to the process in northern ireland and to forming closer links with the republicthe hon member for glasgow north west john robertson welcoming us to glasgow said that we will enjoy some \u201cproper whisky\u201d\u2014i think that was his description i look forward to that but i think we will celebrate other scottish products as well we look forward to extending the discussions about trade and the economy to the next plenary session in glasgowi join in the shadow secretary of state\u2019s tribute to barbara jones the deputy ambassador to london i thank her for the friendship she has shown to the cause and to me personally i wish her well in her new rolet he point was raised about whether the prime minister should attend in glasgow he has certainly been invited as has the deputy prime minister so we hope that their busy schedules will allow them to afford to bipa the same respect as has been afforded by the taoiseach and many other ministers in ireland i would like to thank all members for taking part in the debate and the backbench business committee for allowing us time to hold itquestion put and agreed toresolvedthat this house has considered the matter of the work of the britishirish parliamentary assemblyproceedings interrupted order 13 june", "i beg to movethat this house has considered the matter of the work of the britishirish parliamentary assemblyi thank you mr speaker and the backbench business committee for this opportunity to discuss the work of the britishirish parliamentary assembly which i shall refer to as bipa i also thank my right hon friend the minister and other right hon and hon members for attending the debate\u2014the good turnout demonstrates that the work of this body is recognisedbipa was started in 1990 as the britishirish interparliamentary body to foster a common understanding between the bodies represented on it it has 68 members including 25 from both houses of the uk parliament 25 from both houses of the irish parliament 15 from the united kingdom\u2019s devolved institutions and one member from each of the isle of man jersey and guernsey so a wide area is well representeda parallel body at ministerial level the british irish council was set up in 1998 and at this stage it is appropriate for me to say that bipa seeks closer links with that body bipa holds two plenary sessions a year one in the uk and one in ireland the 44th plenary session was held in dublin between 13 and 15 may and not for the first time it was attended by the taoiseach in addition all members present were welcomed to the president\u2019s official residence at phoenix park by mr michael d higgins the president of irelandi would like to quote from a speech made by the taoiseach to bipa\u201ci know from my own time as a member of the association the importance of the work of bipa now that i am taoiseach i can see very clearly the contribution you continue to make in support of peace prosperity reconciliation and political friendships and understanding between these islands\u201da strong commendation indeed the taoiseach referred to the importance of britishirish relations and his sentiments are borne out by the facts especially with regards to securing the peace in northern ireland and tradethe uk is by far ireland\u2019s biggest export destination and in turn ireland is the uk\u2019s fifth largest export market as the prime minister has said on many occasions we export more to ireland\u2019s 45 million people than we do to the third of the world\u2019s population in china india russia and brazil that important statistic is rather worrying in some ways and i suggest not that we reduce our trade to ireland but that perhaps we should try to increase it to further corners of the world even in recent times of economic difficulty in 201011 trade between ireland and the united kingdom actually increasedissues such as trade were discussed at the plenary session in may by a number of speakers including senior executives from glen dimplex greencore and glaxosmithkline and the importance of trade links was referred to by the irish finance minister the plenary session also heard from the irish minister for transport tourism and sport who referred to the fact that 600 passenger and freight services and 60 air routes run between the uk and ireland every week resulting in 29 million british visitors to ireland last year alone those are startling statisticsthe irish health minister told the plenary session that ireland is looking to learn from the uk\u2019s experience of health care we heard from darina allen from ballymaloe cookery school about good healthy food and from dr maurice manning on the importance of correctly handling the decade of centenaries that we are now ininterestingly the plenary session also approved a motion by the right hon member for torfaen paul murphy a former cochair of bipa which expressed concern about the proposal to close the rt\u00e9\u2019s offices in london i hope he will raise that matter in a few minutes if he catches your eye mr speaker finally the work of the four subcommittees\u2014on sovereignty matters european affairs economic affairs and environmental and social affairs\u2014reported to the plenary session i thank committee members for their work in preparing reports on important issues not least one on flooding which is an issue close to my heart given that i represent tewkesbury", "i thank the hon gentleman for his very good intervention developing close relationships with the britishirish council would be a start and we could report to that body about the assembly and subcommittee\u2019s work i wanted this debate to highlight the existence of bipa and its work there is a long way to go to get the government to take on board what we are doing but at least this is a start\u2014the minister is here and listening\u2014and i certainly think the hon gentleman makes a very good pointthe plenary session was expertly arranged by the irish members and secretaries in particular i pay tribute to my cochairman joe mchugh td who is a skilled dedicated and helpful cochairman for all his work and the support he gives me as a relatively new cochairman the legendary irish hospitality was also on full display at the plenary session as i am sure everybody can imagine including at the president\u2019s house the irish take bipa very seriously as was reflected in the taoiseach\u2019s speech that i read out earlier but there has been suspicion and concern in the past\u2014this is no reflection on the work done by my predecessors and previous bipa members\u2014that it is not taken quite as seriously on the british side that is one reason i wanted this debate and why i am so pleased to have secured it we are strivingto match the enthusiasm and commitment of the irish and we will hold the 45th plenary session from 21 to 23 october in glasgow we look forward to going there i said that there had been a trade or economic theme to the plenary in dublin and we hope to follow a similar line in glasgow when i am sure we will be treated to many interesting lectures and discussions about some of the products we might find in scotlandi would like to thank our staff on this side of the irish sea robin james and amanda healy for their hard work in putting all the meetings and everything else together without their help we could not hold the meetings we will be visiting dublin next week for steering committee meetings and on monday we will discuss how we might move things forward including how we might bring to the governments\u2019 attention the work of the steering committees as was mentioned earliersome people consider bipa a talking shop but given the history between the two countries particularly the terrible experiences in northern ireland i would suggest that talking is extremely important for relations with ireland and within northern ireland had we not had people talking in the past we would not have achieved the relative peace we have in northern ireland\u2014i say \u201crelative\u201d because challenges still lie ahead just last night on \u201cnewsnight\u201d there was a harrowing report about some activities in parts of northern ireland there are people who want to wreck the peace process and return to the bad old days so i would suggest that if bipa is a talking shop it is a very useful talking shop because it enables us to get together with people who perhaps have different views and aspirations but who all agree that democracy and talking to each other are the way forwardas many people in ireland said and continue to say relations between our two countries are at an alltime high i was greatly privileged last year to be in ireland for part of her majesty\u2019s visit and i have to say it was an awesome visit the success of the visit of course was down to her majesty\u2019s enormous dedication and extraordinary talents but it was also down to the extremely warm welcome and wonderful preparations on the irish side it really cemented relations to an extent that had not been seen before we look forward to future relations with ireland if bipa has made a contribution to the development of peace in northern ireland and the close relations between the uk and ireland i am pleased to be part of that and i pledge to work as hard as i can to help steer the organisation in the right directioni do not want to speak for any longer because several members wish to speak but i want again to thank you mr speaker and the backbench business committee for allowing us the time to debate this issue and to bring to parliament\u2019s

province", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government what recent estimate he has made of the number of houses for which planning permission has been obtained but which have

north antrim ian paisley feels when he sees buses bits of which were made in his constituency going down whitehall i felt the same when i saw propellers made by and large in my constituency on various aeroplanes taking me to different parts of the world recently including hong kong vietnam and nigeria that reinforces in me the idea that highspend hightax economies are things of the past if ever they had their day they do not have it any more we live in a competitive world the only way that we will retain prosperity in the uk\u2014in northern ireland and anywhere else\u2014is by being competitive that will not be achieved by spending more money than we earnalthough the minister has correctly outlined some of the difficulties in devolving the responsibility for corporation tax to northern ireland i am convinced that they can be overcome nothing worth while is ever easythe option of course would be to reduce the corporation tax rate in the uk to 125 which would be acceptable and simple to do in the absence of that policy in the budget\u2014i imagine\u2014the minister needs to consider seriously devolving to northern ireland the power to vary the corporation tax rate the hon member forpontypridd owen smith who spoke for the opposition is right as i said it is not a silver bullet but it is a golden opportunitysitting adjourned without question put standing order no 1011", "the hon gentleman will be aware that one of the indicators in northern ireland that is not as good as in the rest of the uk is the figure regarding the economically active given that the welfare cap will be \u00a326000 which one would have to earn \u00a335000 to bring home is he aware that the median wage in the private sector in northern ireland is \u00a320000 that is a lot less than \u00a335000 what would be the incentive for people to go out to work if the cap was not to be there", "the hon lady might mention at this point that it has been agreed that our next inquiry will be into aviation policy for the reasons that she gave", "i think that the hon gentleman would accept that my speech was based on the idea of growing the private sector the select committee felt\u2014not unanimously but by and large\u2014that cutting corporation tax to attract inward investment was a way of doing that as a result of that the public sector would become a smaller percentage of the whole without necessarily getting smaller", "may i point out that devolving that power would cost absolutely nothing at all the select committee\u2019s proposal for it to be devolved costs nothing the action that the hon gentleman\u2019s committee then takes is for him to judge", "does the hon gentleman agree that if the energy is not produced in northern ireland\u2014and assuming demand stays the same\u2014it will just be produced somewhere else", "it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today sir alan usually you and i jointly chair the allparty group on racing and bloodstock industries so today\u2019s debate is a diversion but i am sure that it is extremely important just as our other debates areit is a pleasure to open this debate on the northern ireland economy on st david\u2019s day and i am delighted to be doing so i start by thanking all the members of the northern ireland committee\u2014both past and present\u2014who have worked extremely hard in compiling the reports that we have produced which i will refer to i also thank the committee staff who work extremely hardthis is a very important debate as are all debates on the economy at this time just today we have all seen bad unemployment figures throughout europe we hope that our own economy in the uk is starting to recover but i think we all feel that there is a long way to go and that there will be some very difficult decisions to make so as i said any debate on the economy is important i am pleased to introduce this debate which is about rebalancing the northern ireland economyas well as having the honour of chairing the northern ireland committee i have the privilege and pleasure of being joint chairman of the britishirish parliamentary assembly i am quite new to that role and i am the british chairman of the assembly i mention that to demonstrate my friendship with the republic of ireland given that i shall refer to that country in my remarksof course we are all aware of the difficulties that northern ireland has gone through most hon members would probably agree that those difficulties are due\u2014at least largely and probably entirely\u2014to the terrorism that existed in the province for many years there were 30 years of real hard terrorism when people suffered terribly lives have been shattered and many lives were lost if that was not bad enough as a result prosperity in the province has been a lot lower than it would and should have been otherwise this debate is a contribution to the attempt to start turning that situation aroundwhen we discuss the economy in northern ireland it is important to recognise that there are a number of bright spots the unemployment rate is lower than in the rest of the uk and is falling and there is a higher level of manufacturing production research and development investment in northern ireland increasedby 6 last year albeit from a low base belfast is the second most attractive city in the uk after london for foreign direct investment for 16 to 18yearolds in northern ireland there are better educational outcomes than in the rest of the uk although there is a lower level of qualification among those in the working age population this year there are increased tourism opportunities with the titanic anniversary and next year there will be celebrations with londonderry being the city of culture these are all bright spots and there are others that i have not mentionedhowever we would be derelict in our duty if we did not recognise that there are problems and one of them is the size of the public sector let us just consider employment of those who are employed 277 work in the public sector as against an average of 206 in the rest of the uk which makes northern ireland\u2019s public sector the biggest of all the uk regions of course that results in higher public spending \u00a310706 per person in northern ireland as opposed to \u00a38845 in the rest of the uk\u201421 higher in northern ireland which is a significant cost there is no doubt in my mind that that increased cost is largely if not entirely due to the 30 years of the troublesif we look at the number of employed people 679 of the workingage population in northern ireland are employed as opposed to 703 in the rest of the uk that is another statistic that is not favourable for northern ireland productivity per job is only 853 of the uk average if we look at gross value added northern ireland with gva of \u00a315651 is again lower than the rest of the uk which has gva of \u00a320476 indeed northern ireland is the lowest region of the uk in terms of gva apart from wales the fall in gva since the prerecession peak has been more pronounced in northern ireland and growth in northern ireland is projected to be slower than in the rest of the uk in the coming yearthere are a number of other problems there will be a reduced rate of assistance from europe from 2013 and there are also higher fuel and energy costs recently the select committee visited the coolkeeragh gas plant which is just outside londonderry people at the plant highlighted a big problem that i hope the minister will take on board i have raised it in the commons already that problem is the carbon floor price when it is added to the taxes and everything else coming from the eu it could make northern ireland very uncompetitive in terms of energy production i hope that the treasury will take that point on board and consider what can be done to avoid penalising companies in northern ireland that are only doing the right thingswhat do we need to do now obviously we must try to increase the prosperity of people in northern ireland so that they are less dependent on taxpayers in the rest of the uk and we need to do that not only to improve prosperity but to cement the peace that so many people have worked so hard to achieve i am not for one moment suggesting that poverty is an excuse for violence or lawbreaking of any kind\u2014it certainly is not but we must recognise that when people are unemployed with time on their hands and nothing better to do they are more likely to turn to activities that are not to be approved of that is not an excuse but we should recognise the fact that it is a likely outcome for some people increasing prosperity in the province and givingpeople opportunities to work or to receive education and training will surely divert people who might just turn the wrong way that is very important and it is one of the things that we have stressed in our reportswhat changes are needed to increase prosperity in northern ireland i have a list of suggestions we probably all accept that we need to reduce the size of the public sector and increase the size of the private sector again that raises the question of how we do that one of the things that the select committee has looked at is trying to make northern ireland more competitive so as to attract more inward investment i shall turn to the corporation tax proposals shortly but there are a number of other issues that i want to discuss brieflya short while ago the select committee carried out an inquiry and produced a report on air passenger duty one of our concerns at the time was that continental airlines the one and only carrier from belfast to new york was in serious danger of pulling out and stopping those flights that really was a threat to the economy in northern ireland we conducted a short inquiry and came up with the proposal that the apd for longhaul flights should be reduced and the government responded by reducing it to \u00a312 per flight which is the apd for local flights before that it was \u00a360 for a family of four flying to new york from belfast that was \u00a3240 in tax before they had even got on the plane the airline was carrying that cost which made it extremely uncompetitive and was threatening to pull out it was a serious threat and we lobbied hard for the secretary of state for northern ireland and indeed the treasury to try to do something about it urgently i congratulate ministers and the government on responding so quickly and reducing the tax we hope that we can move forward in that respectwe also suggested that the policy for setting the rate of air passenger duty for longhaul flights be devolved to the assembly i am pleased that that is now the government\u2019s policy and it will be enacted through the finance bill i welcome that move which is a step in the right directionwe need to improve the planning situation in northern ireland again that is a devolved issue so i will not dwell on it too long everyone would accept that planning has to become more efficient we have just heard of the new golf course near the giant\u2019s causeway finally being given planning permission but it took 10 years to get to that point it is hardly an incentive for new businesses to try to do anything good when they face that type of planning process although i am aware that there were several objections to the planning application", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention he is a very active member of the select committee i entirely agree that the golf course is extremely important it is a great investment and a great opportunity i hope that northern ireland goes on to attract the open championship\u2014not necessarily to that course but to a course in northern ireland it is important to move in that direction i urge the government to get behind the project i know that it is a devolved matter but there is great frustration with regard to the planning situation as there probably is in most local authorities there certainly is in mine but it is particularly the case in northern irelandin about two weeks\u2019 time we shall publish our report on our inquiry into the smuggling of tobacco alcohol and diesel obviously i cannot go into detail at the moment but i can reveal a couple of figures fuel fraud costs northern ireland \u00a370 million and tobacco fraud costs \u00a342 million making a total of \u00a3112 million which could be in the pockets of the health service or the education service indeed it could help to reduce taxes in northern ireland that is something that we are looking at i cannot go into too much detail at the moment but it is a real issue not only does smuggling cost the economy a lot of money but it provides opportunities for paramilitaries exparamilitaries and people who are up to no good to engage in activities that do the economy northern ireland and the uk no good at allon creating a genuinely shared future and reducing the cost of division we have made huge progress\u2014let us not forget that\u2014but we need to do more yesterday i read a report on the bbc website that claimed that when the agreement was signed there were 22 peace walls but there are now 48 segregation of housing and education is not only divisive in an area that needs to end division it is costly as well we need to find an affordable way of dealing effectively with the past i do not want to get into a debate about what the secretary of state calls costly and openended inquiries this is not the time or the place but we have to find a way of dealing with the past effectively and more affordablyi turn to the corporation tax report that we produced we spent a lot of time looking at corporation tax in northern ireland to be fair to everybody concerned i note that not every member of the committee agreed with the proposals that were made however many members did agree", "indeed that was one of the points that we made in our report we were astounded that the treasury did not have a figure that we could use to assess the cost i will explain the background because of the azores judgment in europe it appears that ifcorporation tax is reduced for one area of a jurisdiction\u2014not for all the jurisdiction\u2014that part has to take the hit in terms of the outcome in other words if the tax take drops by say \u00a3100 million it cannot be made up by westminster it has to be part of the block grant we were astounded to find that the treasury did not have that figure our report urges the treasury to put a mechanism in place that will tell the assembly\u2014not so much us\u2014what it will costcorporation tax across the united kingdom is on its way down at the moment it is 26 in the republic of ireland it is 125 it is important to note that northern ireland is the only part of the united kingdom to share a land border with another european union state\u2014the republic where there is a massive tax difference the location of northern ireland is also important it is an island off an island it is peripheral in my view it certainly needs something that it can wave and advertise to attract inward investment otherwise it is may be easier to invest in other mainland areas or countries with lower tax rates it is not immediately obvious why one should come to northern ireland but it is easy to see why people go to the republic of ireland it is possible that google facebook and twitter were attracted to dublin because of the very low rate of corporation tax of course inward investment is extremely important but if a company is making a profit and paying a percentage of that in taxation it has less money to actually spend on reinvestmentas i said not all committee members agreed but interestingly the irish government agree the present taoiseach has said publicly that he would approve of northern ireland reducing its corporation tax to 125 that is an amazing situation to find ourselves in we are competing with the republic and we want to compete even more strongly and they are in favour of that perhaps it is a mark of the progress that has been made in the incredibly good relations that exist between the republic of ireland and this country it is certainly to be welcomed", "i am happy to give way to the minister", "i am sure the hon gentleman is right and there may be political reasons why they want the same rate there may be political reasons why the irish government want a lot of things the same across the island of ireland as the hon gentleman knows i speak as a strong unionist however the issue is bigger than any of those problems the hon gentleman may be right in that case he leads me to an important point", "i agree with the hon gentleman who makes the point better than i did the outcome is importantit is significant that the hon member for east antrim led me to europe when we received an application from ireland for assistance last year against all the pressure from europe to increase its rate of corporation tax ireland resisted no matter what else they had to do the irish government knew that that was a crucial part of their economy it was absolutely crucial in attracting foreign investment and they clung and are still clinging to it i wish them every success in doing soi said that the irish government agreed almost all the witnesses from whom we drew evidence also agreed there were an awful lot of them over a long period the cbi the federation of small businesses kpmg pricewaterhousecoopers and many others they saw the proposal as an important step but they all stressed that there was not a silver bullet\u2014there is not just one solution to transform the entire economy in northern ireland everyone said that no one was pretending that corporation tax in itself is the complete answer but they all saw it as a golden opportunity and felt that we had to go that waybecause of the azores ruling we cannot change things here our committee\u2019s recommendation is for the assembly to be given the authority to set its own rate of corporation tax if it is given that authority and if the treasury comes up with the deal the figures and everything else it will be up to the assembly to decide what it wants to do the issue will be out of our hands here at westminster that is the proposal which i fully supporti have concentrated on the northern ireland economy many things happening across the uk will affect the economy there for example creating growth reducing the budget deficit and reforming benefits but i have not touched on them because i have tried to concentrate just on northern irelandit is important to recognise that northern ireland has come a long way thanks to the politicians in northern ireland and some of the leading politicians in the uk generally particularly however it is due to the resolve determination steadfastness and

sutcliffe who works so very hard to try to resolve what are extremely difficult issues i congratulate my hon friend the member for west suffolk matthew hancock on introducing this important and timely debate and thank him for many of the things that he saidi want to declare two nondeclarable interests i am jointchairman of the allparty group on racing and bloodstock industries along with the hon member for mansfield sir alan meale whom i am pleased to see present with respect to other members i also have the honour of representing what i consider the greatest race course in the world\u2014cheltenham race course where each year we have the worldfamous cheltenham gold cup that is one of the greatest if not the greatest steeplechases in the world i am delighted that my hon friend the minister is a holder of one of those gold cups i know that it is not the tradition of government to have people who know what they are doing in post but he is a very welcome exception to that rulei can only really endorse a lot of what my hon friend the member for west suffolk and others have said in this country we have what is probably the greatest racing in the world it is certainly up there with the best if not the actual best as the hon member for bradford south said we had the most fantastic spectacle at haydock on saturday when kauto star won against all expectation providing such excitement in the world of horse racing and in the world of sport last year tony mccoy\u2014ap mccoy\u2014won the bbc sports personality of the year because of his exploits yet all that gets overshadowed by the constant wrangling about funding and the constant falling out over the levy\u2014not just the level but the detailsi agree with my hon friend the member for west suffolk who said that that is one of the best reasons for getting rid of the levy it is divisive it pits bookmaker against people in racing whatever racing means in that respect the levy was finally decided at quarter to 12 on the night of halloween which made for an unedifying spectacle this is a very outdated and impractical system as has been said it has also delivered falling revenue as the hon member for mansfield said that is important in many respects not just for prize money although it is significant with regard to prize money prize money is not everything but it does filter down and find its way to trainers jockeys and stable staff it is extremely important not just so the rich can get richer to coin a phrase but so that those who work at the bottom can continue to work in the sport therefore it is important to find a better funding mechanism if mechanism is the right word i will come on to thatthe principal point made by my hon friend the member for west suffolk was about how overseas operators are avoiding paying the levy i do not object to anything he said but i have quite a bit of sympathy with the point made by my hon friend the member for shipley philip davies we have to analyse why people have gone abroad it is not just because of the levy to draw a brief analogy i have the honour of chairing the northern ireland affairs committee and one recent proposal was for the northern ireland assembly to have the right to set a corporation tax that would be attractive to companies and businesses compared with corporation tax in the republic of ireland the tax is 125 in the republic and 26 in the uk\u2014a bit of a nobrainer when thinking about where to put a factory or business we should explore why companies have gone abroad in the first place and consider having the kind of tax regime that attracts them that is not just about bookmakers i could expand that argument to allsorts of other businesses especially in the competitive world in which we live i therefore hope that that point will be consideredi have no objection to the proposals that my hon friend the member for west suffolk made to the minister nor indeed to the considerations that the minister is making but we ought to think about why businesses went abroad in the first place the constant pursuit of the exchanges is not healthy for the sport or indeed for bookmakers at this point if we are talking about a levy replacement let us get on with replacing it let us not get on with trying to tinker with the existing levy arrangement if we do that all we will end up with is levy mark 2\u2014a similar arrangement to the one we have now but called something else i want us to move on from thathow do we find the future funding for horse racing that will not be particularly easy if it were easy the problem would have been solved a long time ago we have heard a lot about a commercial solution in terms of name and concept i am all in favour that commercial solution but i am a little concerned that some of the proposals are not a commercial solution at all but a rerunning of the levy we need to avoid thatthere has been a call for any arrangement that is designed and agreed to be underpinned or guaranteed we have to be very careful over how we go about that are we talking about underpinning through legislation if we are we have not really moved on much from where we are now indeed we could find ourselves up in the european court in relation to state aid rules my view on state aid is that we are an independent country with a parliament here and we should do as we will i would not bow to\u2014 interruption  i thought that my hon friend the member for shipley would agree with me on that point however we are where we are at the moment although we may change those rules in the future and we do not want to fall foul of state aid rules any solution that we reach must be compliant if the minister will allow me to say so we were rather too obsessed with state aid rules when it came to changing the status of the tote\u2014we gave them far too much credibility\u2014but there is an issue here no question about that", "just as many hon members anticipated my hon friend\u2019s next statement he has anticipated mine the arrangement has to be consolidated and underpinned by the civil law rather than by legislation i entirely agree with him for a number of reasons and the state aid issue is one another is that if we are going commercial we are going commercial\u2014that is the way we should go i understand his point we have to bring offshore companies back onshore but i would prefer to explore that through the way that i have described\u2014perhapsby making it attractive for companies to do business in this country we may need to go a little further than that but it should certainly be exploredon coming up with the commercial solution i am not entirely convinced that the government should decide the replacement for the levy the government have proposed three options although i do not suppose that they are the only options that they would consider however there are other options that are perhaps not for the government but for racing and bookmakers to put in placemy hon friend the member for shipley talked about the increase in media rights i understand that over the next year from 201112 to 201213 they will increase by 26 that could be considered different from the levy but when an owner gets his cheque for \u00a35000 or \u00a310000 i do not think he is too concerned whether that has come from media rights race courses the levy or wherever he is concerned about the size of that cheque the whole cake is the important thing not necessarily which particular segments have come from where", "i am grateful to the member for the cheltenham constituency but not for the racecourse for his intervention he makes a fair point that needs to be considered the workings of the gambling commission are being looked at which is a welcome step that may be a way of tying people in so that all bookmakers are caught up in the agreement that is eventually reached between racing and bookmakers i hope that that could be exploredon the commercial solution i mentioned media rights i also mentioned sponsorship which is rarely discussed although many bookmakers voluntarily put money into it\u2014not only bookmakers but many other companies i am reliably informed by many in racing who are involved to trying to fund the sport that racing does not pursue sponsors and sponsorship as much as often or as deeply as it could that certainly needs exploring it might not necessarily be part of a system or structure but that money is available companies often sponsor more than just one sport they might sponsor cricket and football and racing that has to be further looked into", "i agree with the cochairman of the allparty group on that matter my only point is that the system should be guaranteed commercially and not necessarily underpinned by legislation or by the government i agree entirely with his point\u2014i simply do not know how people continue to fund owning racehorses if they cover their training fee for one month they have done extremely well that cannot be done every time\u2014an owner will not win a race each month to cover the training fees and indeed they would still be no better off in this country the official figure for costs recovered is about 23 which cannot be sustainablemy final point on a commercial solution is that race courses as well as bookmakers are a big player i agree with a lot of what has been said by other hon members in that there are too many other bitpart players involved it might be more polite to say that too many middlemen are involved which clouds the issue and causes too many problems race courses and bookmakers are probably the main players in finding a solution and we must find that solution horse racing is an outstanding sport that gives much pleasure enjoyment exercise and discipline to many people each and every day we must find a way forward to maintain the very high level that horse racing has achieved over many years", "to ask the secretary of state for

my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton miss mcintosh on securing the debate i also congratulate her and her committee on producing such a comprehensive report as chairman of a select committee myself i know how much work goes into reportsmy hon friend spoke about the devastation that the floods caused in 2007 in june that year my tewkesbury constituency was badly flooded but that was nothing compared with what came a month later in july when the area was absolutely devastated\u2014although paradoxically many thousands of people lost their water supplies tragically three people lost their lives and many people lived for well over a year in caravans as a result of the flooding some have struggled to get any insurance at all even when flooding was excluded from the policy that is how bad things have got this is an extremely important issueas time is limited i will touch on just one issue which links in with the dclg the department obviously has a big role to play in the new planning proposals particularly in areas affected by flooding the report mentions this in paragraphs 47 48 and 49 under the heading \u201cplanning to mitigate flood risk\u201d we cannot completely remove flood risk if it rains as heavily as it did on 20 july 2007 we will have flooding my constituents who live where two main rivers meet and several other rivers run understand that the point is that where possible we should not make matters worse\u2014indeed as the report says we should do whatever we can to mitigate floodinglooking at the proposals that are emerging\u2014i accept that they are from another department but i am sure that defra has had its say in them\u2014we see welcome recognition of the problems caused by water displacement in other words it is recognised that not only could new houses flood but that their being built could cause other houses to flood that seems to be a new development i have struggled to get that message across to parliament the government the environment agency and anybody else the problem is not only new buildings but the trouble that they may cause for other peoplethe big word in the new planning proposals is \u201csustainable\u201d as far as i can read that means that this generation should not make matters worse for the next we could take that further and say that within this generation somebody who lives in village x should not make life worse for somebody who lives in village y basically it is about thinking about other people which i am very pleased about if we adhere to that then surely we should not have too much development in floodrisk areasin the new planning proposals i am pleased to see recognition of the problem of building in floodrisk areas paragraph 149 says that we should\u201cavoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding by directing development away from areas at highest risk\u2026 or where development is necessary making it safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere\u201dthat prompts the question what is necessary although that comes down to business assessments housing projection assessments and site specific assessments it worries me that we have a sequential test and an exceptionaltest that is nothing new\u2014it was in planning policy statement 25 and it has probably been strengthened in the new planning proposals none the less i am still worried about who is making the assessments it certainly is not the people who have to live in the houses who might be flooded or those who might be flooded as a consequence of new houses being builtthe environment agency will play a big role in that which is a cause of concern i have been a critic of the agency for many years and with good reason although i will not go into that now over the years the environment agency has improved\u2014i do not doubt that at all\u2014but more work needs to be done to define its role more closely and more accurately to enable us to assess whether it actually has the powers that it needs to assess the work that it does and to see how effective that work is i know of a planning application in my area where the land flooded but the environment agency said that that land was okay to build on it has also said that where water rests perhaps just below the surface that land is okay to build on i do not accept that\u2014i do not accept that analysis at allwe have a bit of work to do in relation to the environment agency and i urge the minister to speak to his colleagues in the department for communities and local government to ascertain what we are talking about when we say that building in floodrisk areas is \u201cnecessary\u201d i am sure that he does so on already regularly we must examine what is \u201cnecessary\u201d much more carefully i recognise that the draft national planning framework is to an extent strengthening flood defences but we need to go a lot further than that i want to stress that\u2014it is the central point that i wanted to makewhen i say how important it is to build in the right places i remind members of the iconic picture of tewkesbury abbey surrounded by water i have even spoken to people in australia who saw that picture everybody who has seen it remembers it the words \u201csurrounded by water\u201d are very important because tewkesbury abbey which was built at the end of the 11th century did not actually flood deerhurst priory which is just down the road from tewkesbury abbey was built in about the 7th century although it is located in a village that flooded deerhurst priory itself did not flood the point that i am making is that in those days people knew how to build and where to build that is an extremely important point everybody recognises that we need growth in the economy new jobs new businesses and new houses but the question is \u201cwhere do they go\u201d that is the central point that i am making todayi want to mention a couple of other issues as has been mentioned already we need to ensure that all the ditches drains culverts and sewers are properly maintained and repaired we had an incident in my area where two culverts were never joined up and further down the road on there was also a broken culvert houses flooded on that road for the first time ever to my knowledge in june 2007 but then flooded again in july 2007 that is an example of what happens when maintenance is not carried out another estate was built up a hill\u2014the hon member for llanelli nia griffith referred to building at the top of a hill and how it is obvious that the water will run down the hill the same thing happened in the village in my area where the estate was built yet we nowface the possibility in that very village of more houses being built which could cause even more problems the village that i am referring to is prestbury which i am working very hard to try to protectwe must ensure that all the waterways are cleared and maintained that work will not prevent flooding if we get the kind of rainfall that we had on that day in july 2007 but it will help as my hon friend the member for beverley and holderness mr stuart mentioned we also need to ensure that any flood prevention schemes that are implemented\u2014we are getting some in my area and they are very welcome\u2014are well designed and actually workif we do all those things if we are sensible about those things and if we apply common sense we will not prevent all the flooding\u2014i have already said that\u2014but we will certainly convince our constituents that we are taking sensible decisions and that we are doing everything we can to mitigate the worst effects of flooding", "to ask the secretary of state for health what his policy is on a the future of anthroposophic

other business taking place in one or two committees here today i do not intend to divide the house on the bill but i want to put forward another way of looking at this issue that might not have been consideredfirst i want to look at what betting shops are they are no longer the seedy establishments that they might once have been they are places where people can have an innocent flutter on the grand national on the cheltenham gold cup\u2014which takes place in my constituency\u2014on the derby or on the 235 at lingfield on a rainy tuesday the betting industry of which the shops are obviously a part supports more than 40000 jobs across the country in addition to corporation tax they pay extra betting duty and all that tax put together amounts to \u00a3700 million being paid to the exchequer every yearthe betting industry also pays the horse race betting levy which goes a long way towards funding the sport of horse racing which is the second most popular spectator sport in the uk and employs many thousands of people on top of those employed directly by the betting industry betting paid \u00a360 million to racing through the levy in 201011 on top of that the industry pays millions of pounds in voluntary contributions as sponsorship of the sportit is important to look at where that money from betting shops goes yes some of the money from those bets goes to prize money for the top races such as the grand national but it also goes to many races that are worth less than \u00a32000 that money in turn is redistributed to trainers and to jockeys and stable staff many of whom are not very well paid at all it also funds training and education including the schools programme it pays for integrity and regulation in horse racing which keeps the sport clean it pays for veterinary educationscience research and advances in science it is not only prize money that the betting shops pay for they also fund the education of youngsters there are moves to change the way in which the levy system works but the betting industry will without doubt continue to contribute towards horse racing in a big way there is an awful lot more to the role of betting shops than might meet the eyethe bill would introduce a planning requirement that applies to very few other businesses first it would restrict the number of betting shops in a particular area although competition is hardly ever considered to be a valid planning objection the bill would also require an assessment of the demand for extra shops but surely the person or company proposing to open the business will already have carried out such an assessment the government are now proposing to refine the planning guidance that they issue but i hope that they will not be tempted down the road of preferring one business to another i do not believe that that is the role of the governmentthe argument for restricting the number of betting shops is based on the socalled proliferation of problem gambling but that problem does not exist with less than 1 of those who gamble being defined as having a problem the uk is way down the list in the international league of countries that might have problem gambling it is also wrong to suggest that there has been a proliferation of gambling itself it is important to remember that the amount of money that people gamble is not the most important statistic the important measure is the amount that people lose and that is not a problem for very many people in the united kingdom at all nor is it the case that two shops operating on a high street instead of one would lead to double the amount of money being gambled in that area because the law of diminishing returns will set in even so the number of betting shops across the country has fallen from about 15000 in the 1980s to about 8800 today that is almost a halving of the number of betting shops in the country indeed in the right hon lady\u2019s own area i understand that there has been an overall fall in the number of betting shops i also understand that haringey council has recently refused a number of applications for betting shops so the power to turn down those applications already existsnevertheless it is important to say that the betting industry contributed \u00a35 million last year to support the research education and treatment of problem gamblers and that the gambling act 2005 requires the vast majority of betting shops to have an operating licence a personal management licence and a premises licence before they can start trading there are a number of safeguards in place\u2014and quite rightly soto conclude we have betting shops and the industry more generally paying a lot of money in taxation employing thousands of people funding horse racing and its associated activities some of which involve education and yes responding to market need i thus ask where is the problem that requires even more nannystateism even more needless regulations and even morecosts to be added to businesses and local authorities i would suggest that the problem is not there with great respect to the right hon lady who is trying to introduce this bill it represents a solution

for staying behind to reply to it i am also grateful for his genial and informed approach to all the horse racing issues that the government have to deal withi wish to declare two nondeclarable interests i have the honour of being joint chair of the allparty group on racing and bloodstock industries which is one of the most active wellattended and important allparty groups in parliament i have the honour of being joint chair alongside the hon member for mansfield mr meale whom i am pleased to see in the chamber this evening i also have the honour of representing the great race course at cheltenham which by a quirk of the boundaries falls within my constituency of tewkesbury it is looking forward to one of the greatest national hunt racing festivals in the world in a couple of weeks\u2019 timethe debate is timely because the government have announced their intention to finalise the status of the tote it was set up in 1928 to benefit horse racing and benefit horse racing it has done last year it provided almost \u00a319 million to horse racing through the statutory levy and sponsorship the tote sponsors the cheltenham gold cup one of the greatest steeplechase races in the world which will take place in a couple of weeks\u2019 time it also pays a lot of money in rent to around 60 race courses across great britain and that money is absolutely crucial to racing the tote is more than that however it is an institution and it provides the friendly face of bookmakingit is 10 years since the right hon member for blackburn mr straw then home secretary announced that the government of the day would change the status of the tote at the time it looked as though it would be transferred to a racing trust indeed a shadow trust was set up with its own chairman lord lipsey but the transfer was never made one of the big questions that we must ask before getting too far into the detail is this who actually owns the tote that is not an easy question to answer it was for that reason that in 2004 the then government passed an act of parliament that nationalised the tote with a view to moving it on to the racing trust but they never included that intention in the bill which was a problem my submission is that if the government had to nationalise the tote and obviously did not own it they in some way had a responsibility to racing so it would be wrong for them to do anything with the tote that would deprive racing of its annual income from the tote", "i certainly do share the hon lady\u2019s concerns i shall come to that issue in a moment but she makes a very important point", "the hon gentleman makes a very good point i have already mentioned the money going to racing and the issue of jobs is important not just to the tote many people are employed in racing and if it loses the tote\u2019s contribution those jobs will be adversely affected so he is absolutely rightthe chancellor in his budget speech mentioned the intention of moving the tote on and changing its status and more recently the minister here tonight said that when that happens 50 of the proceeds of the sale will be returned to racing that statement is generally welcome and from a racing perspective it has to be good news but it is not enough there are various questions about that 50 figure how much would it be worth after pension and debt liabilities have been taken into account who in racing would get the money how much would it amount to would that 50 satisfy european union state aid rules those questions need to be answeredmy central point\u2014the most important point which the hon gentleman touched on\u2014is that the money that the tote puts into racing each and every year is more important than 50 of the proceeds of any sale going to racing as i have frequently said that could turn out to be like selling one\u2019s house and living off the proceeds it is okay to do so for a while perhaps five years but at the end of that period the proceeds are all gone and then one is left without an asset more important than that 50 is therefore the tote\u2019s yearonyear contribution to racing and i cannot stress that enough", "the hon gentleman the joint chairman of the allparty group makes an important point which i was going to come on to but shall dwell on now for a moment the people who run horse racing are well known for falling out over every issue that there is to fall out over it is almost a standing joke in the racing industry that they cannot agree on anything but the hon gentleman is absolutely right because on this issue racing speaks with one voice and it is crucial that the government listen to iti do not remember racing being as united on any issue as it is on this one the central point that it is making is that whoever ends up running the tote in a few months\u2019 time should not only be able to pay this contribution to racing every year but guarantee to do so in other words the purpose of the existence of the tote must be to contribute to horse racing because that is what it was set up to do if other bidders are considered\u2014of course the government have to follow due process and consider other bidders\u2014would the industry be able to ask for guarantees from those bidders that the tote would continue to look after horse racing that would provide some difficulty for those bidders because it would reduce the value of the tote as a business\u2014i understand that\u2014but how on earth would they be able to give that guarantee i do not think that they couldwhen the chancellor and the minister further considered the status of the tote they said that they would look after racing\u2019s interests and also look after the interests of the taxpayer i return to what the hon member for mansfield said the taxpayer has never put a single penny into the tote and so in my view the taxpayer does not deserve a return from any sale of the tote this is very different from the millions upon millions that the taxpayer used to have to put into the old nationalised state industries i want to see more fairness for taxpayers and lower taxes i am always on the side of the taxpayer i come to this house to represent them however on this occasion they do not need any representing", "the hon gentleman is absolutely right it is the efforts of the staff who have contributed so much towards the tote as an organisation that have allowed it to contribute so much money to horse racing", "i entirely agree with the hon lady i will touch on that in a momentas i said the taxpayer has never put any money into the tote and therefore does not deserve any money out of the tote having said that i fully understand thedifficulty that the minister and his department may face because over the years we have seen the treasury grow in strength and it wants some money out of this process however a bid from a tote foundation may qualify to be one of the best bids that it could take up for some of the reasons that have been given a tote foundation would of course continue to employ staff and therefore continue to have a pension liability it would continue to be responsible for any debts that the tote may have all that has to be put into the melting pot an undiscounted cash payment could be made if the tote is to continue as a foundation or as the tote organisation and continue year on year to pay money to horse racing there is no need for the 50 sum to be given back to horse racing because it would be getting something far more valuable\u2014the ongoing amount each and every year that is extremely important", "my hon friend is absolutely right that that is the crucial element if there is one message that i would like the minister to receive tonight it is that we have to be certain of the ongoing contribution we cannot be certain of it if the highest bidder is simply accepted under certain circumstances we would not even be sure that the tote would continue to exist as an organisation because bits of it could be sold off it is only through this process that i have come to understand what is meant by embarrassment clauses that is how the government might ensure that once the tote is sold or transferred to another organisation or company it will not asset strip it sell it the next day and make a massive profit or cause it not to survive as an organisation", "my hon friend makes a good point i do not want the government to continue to own the tote\u2014not that they own it yet but hon members know what i mean i do not think that it is for governments to own betting shops that is not what they are there for my hon friend is right that the model i am proposing whereby racing gets all the benefit from the tote is not unusual but exists in many parts of the world perhaps the system here differs because the tote if it continued as a foundation would be competing with many other companies such as ladbrokes coral and william hill however his central point is absolutely righti am coming to the end of my speech or certainly to the end of the time that i wanted to take but i want to make one further point in a debate two or three weeksago initiated by my hon friend the member for west suffolk matthew hancock we discussed the future of the horserace betting levy it was pretty well agreed that the present system is out of date and that it cannot carry on in its present form it needs to be reformed or to be replaced completely racing will have to generate more commercial opportunities to get more money into horse racing even if the levy continues as it is if the tote were transferred or sold to an organisation or foundation that was there purely to finance horse racing it would be a move in that direction allowing the tote foundation bid to succeed for example would be a step towards a solution with regard to the levy and the two policies would go forward togetheri started by saying that the ownership of the tote is uncertain but one thing that is certain is that racing has a right to the money that comes from the tote i ask the minister to ensure that that continues to be the case", "to ask the secretary of state for justice what

funding to horse racing", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for west suffolk matthew hancock on securing this debate and on how he introduced it he made some extremely good points i would like to declare two nondeclarable interests as it were first i am joint chairman of the allparty group on racing and bloodstock industries which is one of the most active and influentialwe like to thinkgroups in parliament secondly i have the honour of representing cheltenham race course and so i take slight issue with his assertion that newmarket is the centre of world racing i readily acknowledge that it is a fantastic establishment and the home of flat racing but i would suggest that cheltenham is the home of national hunt racingmy hon friend is right to draw attention to the dangerous situation with regard to prize money it is not a matter of rich owners becoming richer it is a matter of enabling all owners to continue to own race horses and to race them at the right standard and at the right level he also pointed out that the important part of the debate is the knockon effects on stable staff jockeys and trainersall the people who are not well paid but who should be able to continue to carry out their essential work take them out and the whole sport collapses that is why prize money is so important and my hon friend is absolutely correct to point out that in many races owners would lose out even if they won if a horse is at the lower levels of racingthe lower levels are extremely importantthey would have to win possibly eight or nine races a season just to break even and that would be in a good year however no horse is going to do that so he is absolutely right to point out the problemthe current situation is paradoxical because as my hon friend also pointed out we have the most tremendous racing in this countryindeed probably the best in the world in just a few weeks time we will have the great cheltenham festival which is surely the greatest racing festival in the world we can also boast the grand national shortly after and then royal ascot and the york week in augustabsolutely tremendous racing that is not bettered anywhere in the worldand yet we also have this financial problem if seems that the two situations should not go together but they do racing has continued to exist because of the generosityor as my hon friend the member for shipley philip davies said earlier from a sedentary position the stupidityof some owners who have continued to lose money it would be rather complacent of racing to accept that this situation will continue indefinitely because i do not think that it will", "my hon friend is absolutely right it is not just winning the cheltenham gold cup that is important horses do not start off running in the gold cup they start off running in pointtopoint races before building up to races where the prize money is perhaps less than \u00a32000 my hon friend is also absolutely right about all the people involved in that we cannot lose those feeder tracks or what i would describe as feeder racingwe therefore have a problem and i have reluctantly come to the view that the levy is an outdated system that has to be replaced we have the problems of falling prize money and owners running horses and not getting back a third of what they put in even when they are placed all those problems exist under the present system so the present system cannot be right i have long felt that the existence of the levy does at least two things first it divides the people of racing when i say the people of racing i include the bookmakers because many bookmakers whether they are chief executives or work for ladbrokes or hills are also racing people however each and every year the levy negotiations serve to divide those people we end up with this gratuitous violence from one side to the other which does racing no good we saw what can be achieved when the whole of racing got togetherfor onceto promote tony mccoy who became bbc sports personality of the year a muchdeserved award that is racing getting togetherit is racing at its bestbut the levy has served to divide it each and every yearthe second thing that the existence of the levy has done is to allow racing not to address the need to find alternative funding as urgently as it might have done there are alternative funding mechanisms and routes for money to come in for instance media rights is one way while sponsorship is another racecourses take money from the public and from sponsorship and hospitality my hon friend the member for shipley was absolutely right to say that there might be a better income stream for racing from those sources in future in 2004 when this house passed legislation to abolish the levy it was not enactedi understand that it is still on the statute book and can be enacted by a statutory instrument at that time there were negotiations and discussions on the then british horseracing boards ability to sell its data rights to bookmakers in order to get money for racingthat option was seen as a possible way forward however at that time the european union being the wonderful organisation that it is decided that this could not happen it is now time to revisit that opinion as expressed by the european unionand for the benefit of those reading this in  hansard i was being sarcastic when i described it as a wonderful organisation that decision has to be revisited because i see a need to replace the levy i have thought long and hard about this and i think that the minister probably ought to announce that the statutory levy will end in let us say three years time that would give racing the opportunity to forge new relationships and develop new income streams in the knowledge that the levy will no longer be there after a certain point setting a date will concentrate peoples minds so that they have to come up with other funding mechanisms", "the hon gentleman is absolutely right i think that i am right in saying that when betting shops were licensed in 1963 about 100 of their income came from bets on horse racing or greyhounds now if we put fixed odds betting terminals into the equation the figure is as low as 35 in many cases we have also had the internet and betting exchanges coming forward none of that was seen or even thought of in 1963 so he is right the world has moved on racing cannot go back to 1963 and say that it wants the same funding mechanism i also entirely agree that when we decide on a replacement for the levy we have to be flexible that is why i would prefer more commercial arrangements because they are by necessity and by their very nature flexible", "i understand my hon friends point but i think that the levy drives people apart i do not think that it brings them together however the british horseracing authority has done a good job of keeping the sport clean which i accept is essentiali want to move on quickly because i have only a minute left the minister should give some consideration to announcing the end of the statutory level perhaps in three years i emphasise the word statutory because racing can always come to an arrangement with bookmakers whereby they still get paid for bets or picture rights or whatever elsei want just to touch on the importance of the tote the future of the tote has to be secured i very much hope that the minister will allow the totes own bid to continue to run the organisation at least through to the next round last year the tote contributed \u00a319 million to racing one way or another if that were lost racing would suffer a very severe blow indeed i am not sure that a straight commercial sale of the tote would provide security for racing nor would it benefit racing in the way that the government have promised it would let us not forget that the taxpayer has never put a single penny into the tote and therefore in my view does not deserve any money out of any transfer of its assets i am always on the side of the taxpayer but in this case the interests of racing should come first", "to ask the secretary of state for energy and climate change what recent discussions he

the right hon member for torfaen paul murphy he ended his speech by drawing attention to the need to bring people together and to allow northern ireland to move on last night he and ialong with one or two other members including the secretary of stateattended a dinner held by the integrated education fund whose aim is to bring people together and educate them regardless of their religion like the right hon gentleman and many other members i fully endorse that aim because the future must be importanton 15 june the prime minister said that the killings on bloody sunday were unjustified and unjustifiable and the secretary of state repeated that today i know that the way in which the prime minister dealt with the report in his statement has brought closure to many though not all of the families involved it has brought a degree of comfort and a degree of solace the prime minister should be congratulated on that the fact that some of us may have questions to raise about the way in which the report was conducted does not in any way compromise the words of the prime minister he spoke them and he spoke them very effectively however some questions do remain about the way in which the report was conductedi have the privilege of being chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee one or two concerns have been expressed in the committee particularly about the time that it took for the report to be compiled and about the costs associated with it it was estimated in the then northern ireland office that the process might take a couple of years lord saville referred to that when he appeared before the committee on 13 october in answer to a question about the time scale he saidwe did not have one i am told that the northern ireland office thought it might last a year or two or something but on what basis they made that estimate i have no ideathere was obviously something of a disjoin between the northern ireland office and lord saville on that point the prolonged time that it took to complete the report must have been very frustrating for the families and indeed the soldiers involved a further problem is that memories would have already faded by the time the inquiry began and would have become even weaker by the time it endedthere is also of course a great deal of concern about the cost in reply to a question about setting limits for the number of hours the inquiry could sit or the amount per hour lawyers could be paid lord saville said in evidencei just do not see how you can in advance put down any sort of time or cost estimatebut the government at the time did that he also saidi do not see how you canset limits yet limits were set my point is that there seemed to be a lack of coordination between the northern ireland office and lord saville and a lack of control over some aspects of the inquirythe point could be made that if the inquiry were to be independent it should have nothing to do with and be in no way the responsibility of the nio but it troubles me that it is reported that lord saville refused to meet the nio permanent secretary to discuss the report and i know that that troubles some committee members as wellthe original estimated cost of the inquiry and then the report was \u00a311 million with lawyers fees estimated at \u00a31 million yet the overall costs were \u00a31914 million with lawyers fees of \u00a3100 million i know that public contracts often run somewhat overbudget but i think that is stretching that to the absolute limit again i do not in any way wish to compromise the words of the prime minister on 15 june but as taxpayers money was involved here we are entitled to ask these questionsthe fact that the process took so long poses certain questions about exactly how accurate some of the evidence given could have been we all have memories of the past and if we are remembering a particularly important incident we will remember it very vividly but when we look backor when perhaps television extracts are replayed or we read a book on the subjectour memories might not be quite as things were therefore the fact that the inquiry went on for so long will have resulted in something being taken away from the memories of the eventsit should also be noted that we are looking back at a different erawe are looking back to january 1972and i want now to read out some comments by lord saville that have not been given a great deal of airing in previous debates in paragraph 26 of chapter 2 of the summary he saysparts of the city to the west of the foyle lay in ruins as the result of the activities of the iraa large part of the nationalist area of the city was a no go area which was dominated by the ira where ordinary policing could not be conducted and where even the army ventured only by using large numbers of soldiersin paragraph 27 he saysthere had been numerous clashes between the security forces and the ira in which firearms had been used on both sidesthat is the background to the events", "i am quoting from the summary but i am well aware that there is a mass of further information behind that summary and i know that lord saville has looked into quite a lot of it the particular point i have highlighted has troubled me howeveri was in londonderry about three years agothe hon member for foyle mark durkan kindly welcomed me i am not sure whether i have told him this but on the next day i visited the police who were doing an excellent job at the end of our meeting at about lunchtime i asked whether it would be okay if i as an englishman went into the bogside inn the police froze for a moment and then replied only if you dont say anything that was three years ago when we had relative peace so what must the circumstances and atmosphere have been like in january 1972again i am not trying to suggest that what the soldiers are accused of having done was right in any way and i am not in any way trying to play down or underestimate the pain the families involved must have felt but i think there is an issue here it is very difficult to look back so far partly because memories fade and partly because we in the safety of our lives are judging the actions of people who must have been extremely frightened i do not know how i would have felt in that situation it is very difficult to assess that accuratelymy hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace made a point about that background atmosphere and what created it again i am not trying to excuse what was done but as was said in our committee people who are or were paramilitaries refer to that period as the war i wish they would not call it that because there are casualties in wars and quite often there are many innocent casualties i do not know whether any paramilitary commanders had machine guns with them that day or if they did whether they used them but if they did have machine guns that day they share some of the responsibility for what happenedwe should pay tribute to lord saville for the detailed work he has carried out and we should support the prime minister in what he has said but i also agree with what a number of members have said so far we must now look to move to the future i have read through a lot of this report and i also read through a lot of the billy wright report a few weeks ago and what strikes me is the waste involved in paramilitary activity with catholics hating protestants and protestants hating catholics that literally wastes lives and it wastes opportunities too some of that still exists recruitment to the police is still done on the basis of recruits religion i want northern ireland to move towards normal politics but that is not normal politicswe have to move to the future we have to put the past behind us there are serious questions about how we do that however just last week i welcomed a number of mps from rwanda to my constituency we talked about how to reconcile the past with the future and they visited belfast to discuss those issues last night i had a meeting with two members of the families who were bereaved at ballymurphy all of that is very difficult and painful and i do not have an easy answer but what i do know is that we have got to keep searching for those answers so that the present and future generations do not lose out in the way that past generations have", "to ask the

debate i thank the minister and his officials for the open way in which they have approached this bill over the past few years we have dealt with many pieces of legislation in this house both in the chamber and upstairs in committee and so i also wish to thank him for the way in which he has conducted northern ireland business he has always been very approachable and he has given us a great deal of help by allowing us access to his officials i wish also to place on the record my thanks to themas the minister has said this brief bill allows the northern ireland assembly to set up a body to set salaries and allowances and conservative members welcome that move we also welcome the modest move towards what we see as the beginning of the end of dual mandates in response to comments made by the right hon member for belfast east mr robinson a few moments ago may i say that i recognise that in the very early stages of setting up the assembly it was important to use the experience of members of this house by allowing them to sit in the assembly in order to give it the experience that it needed i recognise that that was the case then but things have moved on now as i have said if a conservative government were to be elected we would revisit the issue and consider the situation of dual mandates then for the reasons that i have giventhe question is not principally about moneyit is also about the time that any one person can spend sitting in a very active and important assembly in northern ireland while also sitting in this house and dealing with the very important issues that we have here we want to avoid any possible conflict of interest between the two jobsas the hon member for stone mr cash has mentioned we recently passed some important legislation on northern ireland which means that the policing and criminal justice competence has been handed over to the assembly i wish the assembly well in that respect and in every other aspect that it has to deal with", "we welcome the bill we have had various discussions on clause 1 which as the minister says contains most of the meat of the bill we welcome the fact that the northern ireland assembly is to gain the competence to set up a body for the independent setting of salaries and allowances this will bring it more into line with what happens in scotland and waleswe are also pleased that the government met us halfway on the second part of the bill which deals with preventing anyone who is a parliamentarian elsewhere from receiving a full salary in the assembly it is important to move towards the end of doublejobbing and we feel that it would be better to achieve that through consensuswe have three basic objections the money side of the matter which the bill addresses is perhaps the least important but it is none the less an important matter there is also the question of whether people who are elected to the northern ireland assembly can spend sufficient time in this place as the work here becomes more onerous by the day i am sure that it does in the assembly as well and it is difficult if not impossible to be in two places at once", "i understand my hon friends point as i say the money side is probably not the issue that concerns us most of all over the last few years the minister and i have worked together on many committees not only on primary legislation but on statutory instrument committees upstairs and sometimes they have clashed with meetings of the assembly i think that 15 of the 17 northern ireland members of parliament also sit in the northern ireland assembly which has meant that they have not always been able to be present in committee i found that particularly difficult the people with experience of and real expertise about life in northern ireland are the people who live there but if they are in the assembly and cannot physically get to westminster it creates a difficulty about which we are concernedthere is a further point about what has come to be called doublejobbing there is potential for a conflict of interest is it right for people to sit in this house and make rules and regulations for the running of the northern ireland assembly if they actually sit in that assemblywe support the bill as far as it goes but we would have preferred it to go a little further in certain respects we recognise that parliamentary time has become

dealt with upstairs in committee some have been difficult and some have been very easy this one is in a sense the most important but it is also quite easy in that we have unanimous agreement in the house that these orders should go through they have been welcomed on all sides and i add my welcome this evening it has been a rocky road and the last few weeks seemed particularly difficult in spite of those difficulties i certainly never lost hope or my faith that we would get to this position i am very pleased thatwe haveright hon and hon members have made some important and interesting contributions the hon member for foyle mark durkan certainly welcomed the orders but raised an important issue about the sunset clause it is a matter that we discussed when the original legislation went through last year i wondered what would happen if we reached 1 may 2012 and an agreement had not been reached my hope is that having reached agreement on this issueit has been a very difficult issue and has taken longer than all the other devolution issues to resolvethe assembly can agree again in order to renew the department or pass legislation to set up an alternative department that does essentially the same job i hope that the assembly can also start to agree on many of the issues that the right hon member for belfast east mr robinson rightly said people are concerned about each and every day of their lives people do not wake up necessarily wondering about parading or about devolution but they do wake up worrying about jobs their families transport and all the other issues that people in great britain worry about i hope that the example now setwith two parties although it should have been four coming together to agree on a difficult issuewill be replicated in the months and years aheadthe hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael raised the issue of the saville inquiry as did my hon friend the member for north shropshire mr paterson we are not here to discuss that matter tonight but i repeat my hon friends words in order to do justice to the long and expensive time taken in compiling the report we really need the calm of the postelection period not the preelection period i hope that the secretary of state will take that plea into accountthe right hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson in a customarily passionate and forceful speech rightly condemned paramilitary activity it has been unfortunate that we have seen an increase in such activity as my hon friend the member for north shropshire said the bomb squad has been called out and we hear reports of shootings and what can be described only as paramilitary activity virtually every week it must be regretted on both sides i hope that devolving police and justice powers todayand doing so unanimously in this house at leastsends out a message that we are not going to put up with it and that we are going to tackle these issues through politics and dialogue even if there are disagreements the important consideration is how we disagree i hope that today will send out a message to those trying to wreck the process as has been said they do not have support in the communities they have no support either in northern ireland or in the south i hope that message gets through loud and clearmy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack paid many tributes to various people including the ordinary people of northern ireland without whose fortitude we could not have reached this stagewith respect to the orders or devolution in general the problem with naming people for tribute is that not everybody can be mentioned i would like to add the names of margaret thatcher david trimble john hume and a number of unnamed and perhaps anonymous officials who have worked very hard behind the scenes to bring about devolution in northern ireland i would also like to pay tribute to my hon friend the member for south staffordshire who has been an influential and assiduous chairman of the select committee on northern ireland affairs it has been my pleasure to work with someone who i considerand i know the whole house considersto be an outstanding parliamentarian i wish him well for the futurethe right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley has of course enjoyed an extremely long career it was wonderful to hear him speaking with such optimism about northern ireland moving in the right direction he rightly said that we cannot forget the struggles and the pain that so many people went through but it is indeed good that things are moving in the right direction i also wish him well for the futuremy hon friend the member for stone mr cash reminded us in a characteristic speech of the long history of northern ireland history is particularly important when it comes to northern ireland as a lancastrian who has many friends from yorkshire i know that history still plays an important role in relations between people my hon friend reminded us how important history is to the present in northern ireland although we want to move on from some parts of it i certainly hope that today is part of that movingon processthe right hon member for belfast east rightly says that people are in favour of devolution and the conservative party is in favour of devolution generally as well as in favour of the devolution of policing and justice as my hon friend the member for north shropshire said the financial package is important and my right hon friend the leader of the opposition offered immediate support to it when the matter was raised it is a postdated cheque it is going to have to be written after the general election who knows it may well be a member of my own party who has to write it the package was readily agreed to we recognised both the importance of the package and the importance of the issue that it was there to support the devolution of policing and justicewe have heard many speeches today and in the past about how successful we have been and what a long way we have travelled in northern ireland i agree although we must continue to work at peace and reconciliation and making progress we cannot simply accept that things will always be like this we must go on trying to normalise politics and life in northern ireland and we must recognise the challenges presented by the ongoing paramilitary activity by saville and perhaps by 2012 there remains the question of who would be responsible for the support of civil powers ifvery undesirablythat became necessary overall however we have made a huge amount of progress i wish the assembly members well for the days ahead which while they may prove challenging have the potential to be very rewarding", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and

as the final piece in the jigsaw of devolution it will enable the parties in northern ireland now to concentrate on the everyday issues that affect people in the province education being one of the most important we look forward to the orders coming before the house on 22 march and we will support themi also agree with the minister that it is useful when we can work together on these issues he and i have had a number of meetings on the bill it is a short billonly three clausesbut we have had at least that many meetings on it and probably more but i think that that has been useful i say that to inform the house if i needed to that there is bipartisan support for what is going on in northern ireland the issue are too important to be discussed in a party political way they are bigger than that and we try as far as we can to work together with the government we do not always agree but when we disagree we do so in a civilised way which is the way forwardwe welcome the bill which addresses two of the main issues of concern the fact that politiciansnot just in northern irelanddo at present set their own salaries and allowances is looked upon by the public with some incredulity i am pleased that that is changing for the westminster parliament and it is right that we introduce the bill to give the northern ireland assembly the ability to change that arrangement as well there were good reasons for the bill being introduced originally as it dealt with double jobbing which i will come to in a moment things have moved onthe minister is rightand it is only right that we look at the bill againi entirely agree that an independent body should set the salaries and allowances of assembly members that is a start towards trying to restore at least some trust and faith in the political process that is the way we have gone here in westminsteri believe rightlyand the principle is right as the minister said the assembly cannot delegate such responsibilities at the moment but the bill brings northern ireland into line with wales and scotlandwe feltit was certainly the case in the other placethat the proposal was slightly weak in that it did not require the assembly to move in the direction outlined but merely gave it the competence to do so the noble lord glentoran tabled an amendment to require the assembly to delegate the decision making to a separate body the government and the liberal democrats for that matter did not support the amendment so we are where we are but i am heartened that the minister believes that a bill will be brought before the assembly to make that move before 2011 when the next assembly elections will be held that is a good thing i will not make too much of that in the debate as we understand that progress will be made in that respectthe second part of the bill deals with the removal of the salary of assembly members if they also sit in one of the houses of parliament or the european parliament again we support that move and believe it is a step in the right direction the minister briefly referred to sir christopher kellys report on mps salaries and expenses its recommendation 40 statesthe practice of permitting a westminster mp simultaneously to sit in a devolved legislature should be brought to an end ideally by the time of the elections to the three devolved legislatures scheduled for may 2011that is a very clear statement and we entirely agree with it for a number of reasons which i shall come to laterin an article in the  belfast telegraph in may 2009 my right hon friend the leader of the opposition pointed out that being an mp is not a parttime job and i think all members of this house would agree i fully understand the points made by my hon friends the members for stone mr cash and for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack but it should be pointed out that if people are physically sitting in the northern ireland assembly they cannot also be physically sitting here in this chamber and they cannot at the same time be attending committees both here and in the assembly i think that the publicour constituentshave the right to see that at least we are available for parliamentary business on a regular basis and that is simply not possible if people are required to serve in two places", "i entirely understand my hon friends point and i have thought about this issue at length may i return to his question in a moment however first let me say that when the northern ireland assembly was originally set up it was right for us not to outlaw dual mandates because that would have meant that assembly members and ministers could have been very inexperienced through having the dual mandate people who have become ministers are by and large quite experienced politicians and not necessarily just in northern ireland but here in westminster as well i therefore think there were good reasons for not outlawing dual mandates at the start but we have moved on nowlet me now directly answer my hon friends question as best i can this issue is not only about whether people are able to spend sufficient time both in the assembly and hereand i have personally witnessed occasions when it has been impossible for hon members from northern ireland to serve on committees here which is not a good situation as i do not think that allows them to do both jobs properly there is a further point to make about peoples ability to serve two masters westminster mps should be able to take a dispassionate judgment on the workings and performance of the northern ireland assembly but i do not think they are entirely able to do so if they also sit on that assembly therefore i do not think this is merely an issue of time i think it is also about whether one person can serve two masters", "my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack takes me on to a slightly different issue i understand that when sinn fein candidates stand before the electorate at a general election they say to the electorate that they will not take their seats if they are elected", "yes they do take their expensesi am very unhappy about the situation that my hon friend the member for south staffordshire raises i agree that sinn fein members tell their electorate that they will not take their seats and the people who vote for sinn fein might accept that however people who vote for the social democratic and labour partyor the democratic unionist party or the ulster unionist partyhave a right to be represented in this house so i do not think that is acceptable for those who are elected not to take their seats i would much rather that sinn fein members take their seats in this house i do not know whether i have fully satisfied my hon friend the member for south staffordshire but i have given the reasons why our partys front bench spokesmen oppose the practice of holding a dual mandate the bill was too narrow in scope to include an amendment that would have corrected that situation and we should have liked to amend it to outlaw the practice but we are where we are and in the lords the government tabled a compromise amendment that we were happy to agree toa conservative government would revisit the issue as my right hon friend the leader of the opposition has said we recognise that most members of parliament from northern ireland are engaged in two jobs but many of them agree that things have moved on and they have to change if elected to government before introducing legislation we would try to come to a voluntary agreementa negotiated settlement whereby the practice does not continue but my right hon friend has said that if necessary we would consider introducing legislation to bring it to an end we feel that is what the public require they also want a separate body to set allowances and salaries in northern ireland rather than the members who receive them for those reasons i am happy to support the bill", "to ask the secretary of state for

reservation and i ask the minister again whether he can do anything to help the police to protect their officers from these murderous and cowardly attacks", "does the hon gentleman agree that it was greatly beneficial at the time that the three emergency services were based at the tricentre under the same roof would he oppose any threats to that situation", "perhaps i should ask my right hon friend to discuss that point with my hon friend i think that he probably makes a good point and he reinforces the principle that we need regular maintenance and reports to tell us what is going on we certainly need those reports as it is so easy for people not to maintain things and for us not to know about it i return to the car analogy if we do not have our car serviced at the right time it may not necessarily break down next week but it might well do so not long after that if we do not know that regular maintenance has been done we will be heading for problemsnew clause 9 is important and would require the secretary of state to assess the staff equipment and resources that the environment agency possesses in order to implement the bills provisions one problem i had during the floods of 2007i am sure that other hon members did toowas trying to establish who was responsible for what and for which watercourses this may go slightly beyond the scope of the amendments but once we had discovered who was responsible for what getting them fixed became the next problem as we were told that they did not have the money it would be good if the new clause were adopted because the secretary of state would know whether the environment agency had the resources necessary to deal with the problemsnot only the daily ones but the further issues with which the ea is now required to engage and for which it must prepare a strategyit would be folly and dangerous to go ahead without ensuring that the environment agency had the necessary resources it has to prepare a strategy and then implement it and if it needs \u00a3x to do so but it gets only \u00a3x minus 10 per cent or 20 per cent the shortfall might prevent it from delivering the strategy the same problem could arise with the lead flood authoritiesin other words county councilswhich must have the resources to make them confident enough to prepare the strategy that is necessary not a reduced one", "the hon gentleman makes a good point it reminds me of another incident in my constituency which provides an analogy a chemical factory exploded the environment agency was monitoring it we all knew it was dangerous and said so at the time i visited the site and came away not feeling at all well and i made that clear to the agency however it was rather frightened that it did not have the power the clout the ability or the confidence to deal with the problem that factory exploded in october 2000 leaving many people unwell as a result we got rid of the factory it left my constituency the environment agency was very concerned about being taken to court by the company if it carried out certain actions that everyone in the area knew should have been done the explosion proved us right we were not scaremongering it could have killed people a couple of days after the explosion it was amazingly flooded it is a big issue i would like to see the environment agencys role more clearly defined and if it is given more responsibilities and powers it will need more resourcesthat brings me to amendment 5 which adopts a similar philosophy in seeking to ensure that local authorities are properly financed for training and equipment costs and that their ability to carry out what they need to carry out is laid before parliament there is considerable concern among local authorities about being given extra responsibilities duties and powers without the concomitant funding as my hon friend mentioned we are not entirely convinced that the appropriate amount of money will be given to local authorities the minister did his best in committee to assure us that there would be enough i just hope that that is the case the main planks of the bill are that the environment agency shall prepare a strategy and implement it and that the lead local funding authority shall prepare a strategy and implement it if those strategies are to be effective they are going to require the confidence of having the necessary resources providedwith those few remarks i support my hon friend in respect of new clauses 2 and 9 and amendment 5", "it is an honour to follow the hon member for stroud mr drew who as i am sure the house would agree has spoken a good deal of sense about the fire and rescue services who performed heroically in gloucestershire in 2007 and continue to do soit is probably unusual for a frontbench spokesman on one department to serve on a bill in the sphere of another department but when i was asked to do that for the committee stage i did it willingly because the bill is so important to my constituencywhen the minister spoke for the first time this evening he talked about the bill rather more enthusiastically than i might do i do not think it is quite the wonderful bill that he described it is certainly welcome and a move in the right direction and it puts the issue on the agenda for discussion that is to be welcomed but i regret that we were not able to win more votes on amendments in committee i would like us to strengthen the bill tonight although it is welcome and contains nothing to disapprove of there is not enough in it to make the kind of difference that i would like to see", "the hon gentleman is correct i hope that we will return to that issue soonalthough it would have to be after the general election we should treat the billor act as it will then beas a working document and a good start but as something that we need to improve on there is nothing wrong with that we have to start somewhere i do not mean to be overcritical of it but i would rather see it improved in certain ways nowwe have heard a lot about floods occurring once in 100 or 200 yearsor in respect of the northwest floods of a few months ago once in 1000 years i do not think that we can speak in those terms as i do not believe that floods have been recorded for 1000 years in which case we cannot say how often they have occurred over a 1000year period in view of climate change which we discuss in one form or another every day we cannot assume that weather patterns will be the same in the future as they have in the pastthe point is that we must do everything we can to prepare our areas for flooding my own area of tewkesbury floods regularly it has been flooded in the past couple of weeks and the roads as well as the fields near the famous mythe waterworks close to where i live have flooded it does not always make the news because it happens so often it is something that we have to live with regularly living at the confluence of two rivers the severn and the avon we know that we are going to flood every so often what we request of the government is that they do not make matters worsefor example by building too many houses in the wrong place also where it is possible to adopt measures to improve matters we should do soi shall speak briefly to three amending provisions proposed by my hon friend the member for vale of york miss mcintosh the first of which is new clause 2 dealing with the environment agency and the maintenance of main watercourses we had major floods two and a half years ago and afterwards of course there was a lot of wisdom we then saw many drains and culverts in disrepair ditches and streams that had not been cleared out how much work could and should have been done on the rivers and so forth while we have to repair the damagethat has been done throughout my constituencywe should follow a principle of maintaining the waterways it is the same principle as having our car serviced at regular intervals rather than waiting for it to break down servicing should happen so that there is less chance of breaking down again even with the car we cannot entirely rule out a further breakdown but servicing should make it less likely and if it does break down the damage should not be so bad if proper maintenance has taken place it is crucial to stress to the environment agency and other bodies responsible for waterways that we must have regular maintenanceas i said we found many examples in my constituency of where the situation could have been betteror less bad which is probably a better way of putting it the village of prestbury which contains the great cheltenham race course and falls within my constituency saw flooding not only in july 2007 but earlier in june 2007 i visited people who told me that they had lived there for 40 years yet never experienced flooding before i thought that that was rather odd as the area contains houses and streets that flood quite a lot but it seemed not to have happened in this particular place until june 2007 i then realised that a housing estate had been built on what i consider to be an inappropriate place which no doubt contributed to the flooding further down the road i also discovered that two culverts had been put in supposedly to take the water away butunbelievablythey had not been joined up one culvert had become damaged but had not been fixed that is a good example of how a lack of maintenance and a lack of proper planning can make matters so much worse i thus endorse new clause 2 and what my hon friend said about it", "if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities", "the secretary of state says that jobcentre plus has modernised but benefit claimants in my constituency have their claims assessed in cornwall would it not be better if they were assessed locally and preferably face to face", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions what steps she is taking to ensure that inquiries about benefits from members of the public are dealt with locally and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for health how many orthopaedic surgeons have been employed by the nhs in  a england and  b gloucestershire in each of the last 10 years", "what recent assessment he has made of progress on his departments feasibility study into the doubling of the swindon to kemble railway line and if he will make a statement", "i am grateful to the minister for his response do i take it that there will be a decision to go ahead with the redoubling of the line which is important to people who live in cheltenham and gloucestera major town and an historic major city the rail link between those places and london is unacceptably slow unreliable and expensive and people in the area including many of my constituents need to see an improvement will the minister give us an assurance that we will move in the right direction on this one", "to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland what percentage of police service of northern ireland police officers are catholic", "to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland what percentage of those who apply to join the police service of northern ireland as police officers are catholic", "to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland how many  a catholics and  b noncatholics were recruited as police officers by the police service of northern ireland in the most recent year for which figures are available", "to ask the secretary of state for international development what recent discussions he has had with the  a government of egypt and  b palestinian authorities on the delivery of humanitarian aid to gaza and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for international development what recent discussions he has had with the authorities in somalia on the humanitarian situation in that country and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will issue guidance to local authorities and other public bodies in respect of the purchase of endangered seafood and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for international development what discussions he has had with the us authorities on proposals to drop medical supplies from the air to the people of haiti and if he will make a statement", " on a point of order lady winterton can we confirm whether it would be in order to table on report amendments similar to those we are discussing", " i want to speak briefly in support of the amendments tabled by my hon friend the member for vale of yorkit is essential to determine who will maintain what for reasons that have been given many times we face extra building in areas that flood although developers deny that but many of us have seen flooding on fields that developers propose to build on developers rely on sustainable drainage systems being built to overcome the problem but as the hon member for cheltenham rightly said far from helping that could make the problem worse if it is not determined who is responsible for maintaining those systems the environment agency is certainly concerned about that the chairman of the environment agency told that me that on monday evening it is a concernwe have to get this provision into the bill as things stand especially if areas are going to suffer from extra building\u2014i hope they are not\u2014perhaps as a result of the regional spatial strategy or whatever because the developers are hanging everything on the ability of the new drainage systems to cope with the floodwater or runoff water or whatever wherever the water comes from if that is so and that fallback position is to be given any credence in planning guidance or decisions we must at least ensure that those systems are properly maintained", " briefly following on from the comments of the hon member for cheltenham and the proposals made by my hon \u00a0friend the member for vale of york i think it is important that we address the issue of whether we assess the cost or the condition they could be two different things but i certainly think that conditions need to be assessedi know from experience about the troubles that were caused in tewkesbury because of inadequate drains and sewers whether public or private the realisation does not come to anyone until there is heavy rainfall because drains and sewers can often cope with ordinary rainfall and usage but when we get excessive rainfall the problems literally start to surfacewe keep hearing how the rainfall in 2007 was a 1in100 years 1in500 years or 1in1000 years event and so on but i had calls from my constituency just yesterday about flooding taking place\u2014the rivers are coming up and the roads are being flooded that will not make the national news because it happens frequentlywhether new clause 11 is perfectly worded or not i think that we have to have some system for assessing the condition of drains and sewers it was one of pitt\u2019s biggest concerns that we not only assess who owns and is responsible for such waterways but that something is done about them for the reasons that i gavemay i also ask the minister a question the work of internal drainage boards is important as we have heard but often their remit is limited through geography in my constituency they can work west but not east of the severn yet many villages east of the severn in my constituency are subject to flooding and need work carried out the idb might well want to carry out the work itself but is not permitted to do so because of what might be considered artificial boundaries has the minister given any consideration to flexibility in that respect", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department if he will inquire into the whereabouts of the passport of miss inaaya khurram post ref abu dhabi 296566 and if he will make a statement", " i am not necessarily endorsing the hon gentleman\u2019s amendment but clause 33 on risk management gives\u201cexamples of things that might be done in the course of flood or coastal erosion risk management\u201ddoes he not think that it might be useful in a similar way to give some examples of what sustainability might touch upon", " i am grateful for the minister\u2019s confirmation on that point normally however when a bill is enacted it contains a provision which means that the bill can be amended by order i find it a little unusual to have a bill that states that a previous bill can be changed by order", " in addition under clause 24a the minister will specify the number of members of committees will he multiply the figures and let us know how much each committee might cost", " i was not sure of the answer to a question asked by the hon member for cheltenham and i am not sure that the minister has quite answered it he said that we will return to the issue of the membership of regional flood and coastal committees but i am unclear about the actual role of the committees and how they sit between environment agency strategy and the lead local authority strategy what exactly will they do", " the minister may be coming to it but there is the issue of the new houses themselves being floodresistant also there is the need to avoid water runoff on to other areas\u2014the water displacement will that be included in the assessment", " i support the amendment tabled by my hon friend the member for vale of york i also support a lot of what the hon members for cheltenham and for stroud have saidi mentioned earlier that i had a meeting with the chairman of the environment agency last night and he brought up the issue of the maintenance of the suds the agency is concerned about whether the suds\u2014whatever they turn out to be and we had a debate on that last week\u2014will be maintained poor maintenance will be a problem and they will become ineffective the argument for being able to build houses in a certain place will not be strong if the defences are not maintained properly it is important that we put something in the bill that makes that clear i am aware that house builders including in my constituency are putting forward the argument \u201cwe can deal with the water we can deal \u00a0with the runoff we can deal with all these things\u201d we have to make sure that they can because that will be quite a persuasive argument when they put in their planning applications if there is not a safety net attached houses are going to be built in areas where they should not be built that is an issue that i have touched on many timesi want to talk about the position of walham and the mythe as i have mentioned i live close to the mythe in tewkesbury and it is subject to flood the fields there flood very regularly the roads flooded this weekend they continue to flood not to the extent of 2007 but sufficiently to give a warning that something like that might happen again the hon member for stroud mentioned that there are some defences at the mythe i think that i am right in saying that they are semipermanent they are not perfect i do not think that they will necessarily stand the test of time but there is something up there however we have to be absolutely sure that what happened in 2007 does not happen again i will come back to that in a momentthe position of the walham substation is worrying because it flooded badly it was only the heroic work of many people that stopped it going down and the entire county losing its electricity with all the consequences mentioned by the hon member for cheltenham the reason i mention that is that an application has been accepted on appeal to build more than 500 houses not far from the walham site on green fields that at present soak up water there was a lot of flooding in a town called longford which is very close to the walham site people were flooded very badly in that area my concern is that building on that site increases the risk to those houses and also to walham our old friend the regional spatial strategy proposes building an awful lot more housing not far from there therefore we are making the situation a lot worse and a lot more dangerous than it needs to bethe hon member for cheltenham raised the point about whether we should build houses in a flood resistant or resilient way i would rather that they were not built in the wrong place in the first place but if we are to build them he is absolutely right we should consider how we build them the hon member for somerton and frome mr heath raised that point on second reading the image everybody has of tewkesbury across the world\u2014i have even spoken to people in australia and other parts of the world about it\u2014is the iconic picture of the abbey surrounded by water everybody will recall that image the abbey itself did not flood there was water around the abbey but the abbey itself did not flood building work on the abbey began at the end of the 11th century that is a long time ago and we seem to have forgotten the principles that people in those days obviously understoodthe hon member for cheltenham made a very good point about that he also gave a good account of the problems caused by the loss of the water supply some people i think i am right in saying lost their water supply for up to three weeks most people lost supply for between one and two weeks but i think some lost it for a little longer than that to see the heroic effort to get bottles of water to people was unbelievable wagonloads of bottled water were brought in and distributed the final distribution to houses was carried out by very young people\u2014children\u2014older people and volunteers it was an absolutely extraordinary sight we also had \u00a0the bowser system but this was a monumental effort that we cannot really expect people to go through again i spent quite a while on one particular day with the prime minister", " the hon gentleman makes a good point getting water out to people was hugely difficult that operation could not be carried out for very long it is very difficult to get bowsers filled i spent the wednesday with the prime minister who came to walham and to the mythe he was on the phone trying to get people to fill the bowsers more quickly i mention that because if the prime minister himself cannot move things on more quickly then it is a very serious situation if the prime minister cannot move things on then who on earth do we go to it was an extremely serious situation i remember watching the late night news when the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs who had also been down to see what was going on and was very helpful had to give an assessment to the prime minister on how things were going to go\u2014whether the situation would become better or worse i will never forget the news report saying that it did not look good in gloucestershire and that the secretary of state would have to say to the prime minister that there was a great danger of losing the entire electricity supply it was very frightening as i mentioned in an intervention if we had lost the power of communication\u2014television radio or mobile phones that could not be charged up\u2014it would have been a very frightening situation looking back it is perhaps easy to move on and forget but it was a desperate situation and we cannot have anything such as that happen againin order to prevent such an event we must start putting measures in the bill with great respect to the minister i keep hearing explanations about why certain things cannot go in the bill but that reinforces my concern although there is nothing in the bill that i object to there is not enough in it to ensure that we will not go through those problems again even if some new clauses or amendments are not absolutely perfectly worded\u2014and i do not suggest that that is the case\u2014they would be worth putting in the bill as that would move us towards the situation in which we need to be as it stands the bill does not do that i support amendment 26 and new clause 17 and say to the minister that we must put such measures in the bill or it will not much improve matters amendments and new clauses have indentified in detail what needs to be done to improve the situation and i hope that the minister will accept some of the measures that have been put forward", " on that point i think that the water company should have realised that something might happen to the works because the surrounding roads and fields flood regularly just this weekend the police put up signs because the road had flooded although not \u00a0badly it is situated in a place that frequently floods so it should have clicked with the water company that something bad might happen", " the hon gentleman lists many of the things that could have happened if we had lost the electricity supply in addition one thing that could have been lost frighteningly was the power of communication \u2014the ability to get information to people that would have been terrifying", " briefly i want to support the amendment and new clause although a number of opposition members have welcomed the bill we have said frequently that it needs strengthening if it is to have the desired effect and impact which the amendment and new clause attempt to provide my hon friend would probably also want to tie them in with new clause 11\u2014on which i hope to catch your eye mr chope\u2014which relates to schedule 3 on smaller watercourses private drains and sewerslast night i had a meeting with lord smith the chairman of the environment agency we discussed this very issue among others prior to the new regime at the environment agency it was universally the view that dredging of rivers was not necessarily beneficial the new chairman said that that was not necessarily his view each river had to be assessed differently and although it might not be beneficial on some rivers it might be on others will the minister let the committee know what his approach and attitude would be towards the maintenance and dredging of main watercourses each and every main watercourse needs assessing properlyas i hope to address new clause 11 later this morning let me say that repairs and trying to catch up when a flood has happened are essential but are not the best method of flood prevention it is too late then maintenance which so often gets neglected is important as with servicing one\u2019s car it is easy to put it off for several months nobody notices until things start to go wrong in requiring reports to be given on maintenance my hon friend\u2019s proposals would prevent such delay i look forward to the minister\u2019s response", " i have listened to the debate about exactly what pitt did or did not say or what he did or did not mean to say although the report is extremely important it is not necessarily the be all and end all if my hon friend wishes to propose an amendment or new clause saying that foul water should be disposed of in such a way she is perfectly entitled to do so regardless of what pitt said or meant to say", " i want to speak briefly in support of my hon friend\u2019s proposals given the intention behind them i am surprised that they are not already in the bill this issue has been discussed by pitt and others my impression was that there was a consensus that we end the automatic right to connectpeople living in areas that have flooded may have seen the drainage system doing the reverse of what it is supposed to do\u2014throwing water on to the streets and creating rivers running down them that is a spectacular but very frightening sight and it is damaging to any houses that happen to be in the way of what becomes a river i have a particular image in my mind of where that took place again that was following a new development being built in an area where it should not have been built we come back to the same problemwe have not got to the point where the regional spatial strategy for the southwest has been accepted and i hope it will not be accepted for the reasons i have given in committee and in the house many times even if we go down that route we are going to build an awful lot of houses\u2014thousand and thousands\u2014on very small areas of land as i have said before there would be more than 14000 in my constituency alone which is an increase of almost 40 per cent on the current housing stock that is a huge number of houses frankly if we go down that route without the safeguard of the amendments and new clauses put forward by my hon friend that would be very frightening indeedi noticed that the minister was nodding during much of the speech made by my hon friend i hope he will be sympathetic to the new clauses and amendments for the reason given not only by my hon friend and me but by everyone involved in this debate over the past two and a half years", " i do not think that at this point we can set figures for how much money will be available we do not have national strategies or strategies for england or wales can the minister explain literally how this will work will a lead local flood authority prepare a strategy and then go to the government and say \u201cthis is likely to cost \u00a38 million can we have \u00a38 million please\u201d i am not quite sure how it will physically work", " the minister said that if the local authorities are doing their jobs properly they will be in touch with landowners however my experience of the flooding in 2007 was that such discussions did not always take place many riparian owners were not necessarily aware of their obligations and certainly not forced to carry them out with regard to waterways i am sure that the law as it stands is not working so i am persuaded that the amendments tabled by my hon friend the member for vale of york might draw attention to the problem and actually help", " first the hon member for cheltenham mentioned the river chelt he will be aware that the damage was considerable in some areas the gardens of some houses that are just inside my constituency collapsed into the riveran enormous job is still going on and of course major problems resulted from the flooding in that areai understand where the hon gentleman is coming from with the amendment but to remove the word \u201cgroundwater\u201d worries me slightly because if we go back to an earlier debate and consider clause 6 it states\u201c\u2018groundwater\u2019 means all water which is below the surface of the ground\u201dit is important that we retain some reference to water below the surface as well as to water on the surface for the reasons we gave in i think the very first debate we had in committee", "to ask the secretary of state for defence what plans he has for the future of the defence storage and distribution agency at ashchurch gloucestershire and if he will make a statement", "what recent guidance his department has issued to gp practices on their use of 0844 telephone number systems and if he will make a statement", "i thank the minister for that response but he will be aware that the practice is continuing he says that it must end this year but there is an awful lot of this year left so when does he expect the practice to end not only does it make it expensive for people to call their local general practitioner but older people in particular often prefer a human being to answer the phone rather than be responded to by a machine", "if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities", "i certainly endorse the last part of the secretary of states comments may i bring to his attention the rather long waiting list that people who suffer from acute back pain have to go through before they see a consultant as a longstanding and regular sufferer myself i know that it is no laughing matter the waiting time is such that if the problem is serious it can progress a great deal in that time if it is a less serious problem it will no doubt have corrected itself in that time whichever situation applies the waiting time is far too long can the government do anything about that", " the hon gentleman mentioned sir michael pitt\u2019s report i think that he was at the meeting that i attended when sir michael pitt admitted and i paraphrase that the government\u2019s 3 million house target had compromised his ability to rule out building in flood risk areas i paraphrase but that is very much what sir michael pitt said at quite a large meeting which i think the hon gentleman attended", " new clause 25 basically requires the environment agency to submit a formal objection to any large or medium scale planning application that is proposed for land designated as being a flood risk i also want to define medium and large scale which could mean the building of more than 10 houses or the building of a public commercial industrial unit covering an area larger than half an acre just as importantly i should like to discuss what flood risk meanswe have had considerable debate on that already this morning when we tried to define what \u201cflood\u201d meant although i do not think that we reached any satisfactory conclusion and we discussed what risk means and what risk management means i shall try to go a little bit further in my amendment an area should be designated as being a flood risk if there is evidence of its having flooded in the past meaning that water has rested on the surface of the land or just below its surface\u2014i do not intend to go over the arguments that were made before\u2014or if the environment agency in consultation with the local planning authority has reason to believe that the area might be subjected to flooding in future or if the local planning authority or the environment agency are of the opinion that building on a section of land would be likely to increase the risk of other pieces of land flooding as a result of water displacement that is an important pointthe new clause goes to the heart of what we are doing here today\u2014and this week and next week\u2014which is to protect houses businesses and public services from flooding some of my remarks may stray into what might be considered to be responsibilities of the department for communities and local government which is inevitable when we discuss such a billi am particularly concerned because we often hear that floodrisk areas are protected by pps25 i do not accept that argument having looked at it studied it and seen how it works yes it says that building should not take place in floodrisk areas but it qualifies that considerably and allows building to take place in floodrisk areas using the exceptional tests it is a matter of opinion what amounts to an exceptional test or indeed an exceptionagainst that background i want to talk a little bit about what i am really concerned about which i mentioned briefly earlier the regional spatial strategy for the southwest which is not finalised yet we have had 35000 representations on that strategy i think that you will be familiar with some of those mr chope in my constituency alone that strategy proposes to increase housing by about 40 per cent as i mentioned earlier adding another 14500 or so houses to the stock of roughly 40000 houses in my area i could talk about why i feel that \u00a0those projections are flawed but you may pull me up if i go too far down that road mr chope for example the projections are based on growth forecasts although it is difficult to predict what the growth in the economy will be this year never mind over the next 16 years and it assumes that building should take place in principal urban areas rather than scattering it around to villages that might want some housing any projections of that nature are flawed i also object to its being drawn up regionally rather than democratically and locally there are many objections to the rss system and the way in which it is put together in essence i am concerned because where on earth are we going to find the space for those houses in an area that is obviously and clearly a floodrisk area should we have to find that many houses surely we should be sensitive about what happened in 2007the hon member for cheltenham is correct to mention not only july 2007 but june 2007 which leads me to a good example of flooding that he will be familiar with in june 2007 which was just to remind committee members a month before the big flood i visited some houses in prestbury close to prestbury park race course which is often referred to as cheltenham race course although it is in my constituency not the hon gentleman\u2019s\u2014and long may that be so the residents told me that they had lived there for 40 years and had never known there to be a flood i found that curious but then i started to think about it and analyse it and realised that two things had happened that could\u2014i do not know for sure\u2014have contributed to the flood one was that something like 150 houses had been built further up the hill just above prestbury at a place called noverton lane that was a controversial development on what were previously green fields that could soak up the water there was some concern about whether the runoff from the houses would send the water down the hill into prestbury and that it would be called a flood i shall perhaps not go too far into this here because i am sure that we will come back to it two culverts were placed in prestbury some years ago but not joined up why on earth not i do not know but that obviously worsened the flooding and one of the culverts had been damaged and not repaired which made it even worse that relates slightly to a separate amendment but the fact that the houses were built on the top of that hill must have contributed to prestbury\u2019s flooding even though the new development supposedly had new drainage systems that would take care of the runoff in that case they did notthat was in june 2007 those very same people were flooded again in july 2007 the hon gentleman talked about the perhaps inappropriate use these days of the concept of probability of flood risk those people might have been told \u201cthis is a onein250years flood\u201d it was two in one month i do not think that we can continue to use that concept that we can say that july 2007 was a onein250years or a onein1000years event we have not been measuring flooding for that long also every single day of our lives we are rightly told about the dangers from climate change and about how global warming will cause the weather to be very different unpredictable and more extreme i understand that and the evidence is that that will be the case however we cannot use that argument one minute and the next say that this is a onein100years or a onein5000years flood we cannot put both those arguments \u00a0forward at the same time my point is that we have to take the weather conditions over the past few years very seriously and not simply write them off and say that it is very unlikely that they will happen again it happened again this year not in my area but up in the northwest where we saw some terrible flood damage again i read on the front of the times that that was a onein1000years rainfall has rainfall been studied for the past 1000 years i doubt it can the next 1000 years be predicted i doubt it that simply is not the way to address the problem we have to be very careful about where we build housesduring the 2007 flooding there was a development up bredon road which is just going out of tewkesbury houses that were being built at that time flooded shortly afterwards there was another application from a developer to build even more houses up that road it is absolutely unbelievable that anyone should want to do that with total disregard for the people living there and for anybody who was likely to be flooded as a result of taking up green fields i want to stress how important the theory of water displacement is my concern is not only about whether the new houses will flood although that is an important consideration partly because of the difficulty there would be in getting insurance\u2014on second reading and in the evidence session last week we heard some examples of how that has become very difficult\u2014it is about the damage that they will cause to nearby houses i spoke earlier about how building in a place called longford in my constituency will make the flood problem worse for other people as well that is the case in many different areas in my constituency only yesterday i had a call from a developer who wants to build on green fields that were identified by the regional spatial strategy they got terribly upset because i was quoted in the local newspaper as saying that the land floods and that building on the land would cause other houses to flood let them be upset it is a fact people have seen water on the land and nearby houses flood and for that reason it would be very inappropriate to build in those areasin many cases the environment agency does not object sufficiently strongly or as often as it should when we were discussing floodwater on or just below the surface i gave an example of when the agency said to me that it had not objected to a particular planning application because the water was below the surface however it should have objected to that application because if it goes ahead it will cause more problemssometimes\u2014it is only a fairly small number of cases percentage wise but the impact is important\u2014the advice of the ea is ignored the new clause cannot go as far as to correct that because it would be beyond the scope of the bill but the ea should carry out an assessment throughout england and wales to determine which areas of land will flood although it can be assisted by local authorities the job is not as big as it might appear the ea should designate certain areas as flood risks if they qualify under the items that i have listed then it should submit a formal objection through planning applications i understand that that may not prevent some applications from going ahead but it will give a very serious message to developers quite often such matters are determined on appeal if the environment agency is objecting and sending in an objection to the planning inspectors it should carry some weighti accept that my new clause will not necessarily stop all inappropriate development and that it is difficult to define flood risk as we saw in an earlier debate it is difficult to frame in legislation what should really be common sense people who live in such areas who are flooded and who have visited those who are flooded know whether building should take place in those areas it is difficult to write it down i have spent far longer framing this new clause than i have spent speaking on it but that is probably the nature of this kind of thingwill the minister treat this new clause seriously and sympathetically because it is a very important matter for the people in my constituency the secretary of state was extremely helpful at the time of the floods i have heard him say of london \u201cwe are in a floodrisk area here and yet we still have to have building\u201d i do not think that the analogy is accurate or useful it is very different in the area in which i livethe minister earlier touched on the water table he said that it was very high and that it did not take a huge amount of rainfall to cause further flooding much of my constituency is underwater several times a year to the extent that sometimes we do not even notice it such is the danger that one can drive past flooded fields without even noticing my concern is that if we continue to build on green fields that would otherwise soak up water it will cause a great many more problems for the people who not only buy those houses but already live therewe suffered terribly in the floods of 2007 it was an absolute nightmare people were out of their houses for more than a year men women children the ill and the elderly had to live in caravans over christmas and through the winter it was a terrible situationwe understand in tewkesbury\u2014we live where two rivers the avon and the severn come together\u2014that things will be difficult and that we will have floods now and again but we are saying \u201clet\u2019s not make it worse unnecessarily\u201d that is the spirit behind the new clause thank you", " i am grateful to the minister for giving that explanation which is now clear does he not accept that if the water is resting just below the surface it might for example be unsuitable to build on that land the matter is important because there may be a number of planning applications or indeed appeals that revert back to this legislation to determine what a flood area is it is very important that we get this right does he accept\u2014i do not think he does\u2014that water resting just below the surface could constitute flooding i do not think he accepts that and that worries me", " if it is included it seems sensible to put it in the billa few moments ago the minister mentioned or questioned our having a high water table in tewkesbury for example where the severn and the avon meet although i do not think he was suggesting that because it floods regularly it should not be considered a flood", " would he accept that that is flooding", " i welcome you to the chair mr chope it is a pleasure to follow my neighbour the hon member for cheltenham who made some good points as did my hon friend the member for vale of york in moving amendment 131i wish to pick up on something the hon member for cheltenham said he asked whether it was absolutely necessary to make such an amendment given that clause 6 defines ground water as\u201call water which is below the surface of the ground\u201di believe that the amendment is necessary because although the government seek in clause 1 to define the meaning of flood no mention is made of water under the surface clause 11 attempts to define a flood and we need to amend it in order to avoid doubtmy hon friend the member for vale of york made a good point about water resting below the surface recently a contentious planning application of quite large scale was made in my constituency in longford an area with which the hon members for cheltenham and indeed for stroud will be familiar the area floods\u2014there is no doubt about that as anyone who lives or travels near there knows\u2014but the contention was about whether it flooded in part of the area water rests on the surface although even so some people\u2014usually supporters of the developers\u2014contended about whether it flooded in another area the water rests below the surfacethe environment agency when assessing that particular planning application said at a public meeting that if the water was resting below the surface an area was not considered to be a floodrisk area that troubled me anyone who lives near that area and anyone who was flooded in 2007 without any development on the land would view that opinion with worry they would be extremely concerned about houses being built on that land yet because the water was slightly below the surface it seemingly did not constitute a flood risk in the eyes of the environment agency and the appeal to build on the land was granted people who live close by will be very worried indeed\u2014some were flooded and could not get back into their houses for more than a year because of the floods they were living adjacent to the land the flooding for them is going to be far worse it is very important that we add the amendment to clause 1 because if water is resting slightly below the surface it is only a few millimetres different from resting on the surface which surely constitutes flooding or flood riskthe hon member for cheltenham also made a good point about land that normally floods separately the hon member for stroud introduced the problem that we had at the mythe water treatment works in 2007\u2014mythe is in my constituency close to where i live in tewkesbury the fields around the mythe flood several times a year they do not necessarily flood at the mythe water treatment works\u2014that has only happened on the one occasion so far\u2014but the fields do flood regularly they are flooded now and three four or five times a year because they are very close to the river and the water table is high in that area without wishing to be pedantic does the minister consider that to be \u201cflood\u201d the area floods so often but how often is normal in that respect i do not mean to be awkward but would that land be deemed flooded if it floods so many times a year water is obviously not intended to rest on the land but because it does so often would that be considered a floodit is particularly important that we define flooding in rather more detail than clause 1 does at present so i support my hon friend the member for vale of york on including water resting below the surface she went into agricultural purposes but i am afraid that i have not researched the matter in that detail and do not profess to understand too much about agriculture however the amendment is important to the clause for the purpose of house building i hope to return to the theme later this morning but we are going to have a regional spatial strategy\u2014it is not quite finalised yet\u2014that proposes to build something like 14500 houses in my constituency in what is obviously a floodrisk area the hon member for cheltenham asked whether we really need to define what flooding is\u2014if we see a flood we know it is a flood\u2014but apparently we do for the purposes of legislation the threat hanging over us is the building of so many houses in a floodrisk area the increase in the number of houses is massive something like a 40 per cent increase on what we already have in the constituency over the next 16 yearswhen we have such a threat hanging over us it is important that we define in legislation exactly what a \u201cflood\u201d is my hon friend\u2019s amendment will help us to do that somewhat more accurately", " councillor dare touched on an issue i was about to raise the county council will be the lead local flood authority with the responsibility for developing maintaining applying and monitoring the strategy as you rightly say how on earth do you know what that is going to cost until you have developed it given that uncertainty is there not a danger that up and down the country lead local flood authorities might water down their strategy in the fear that they would not get the funding for itsince two and a half years ago the problem has been identifying who is responsible for what this is not meant to be a criticism of the county i am also referring to other agencies when you finally get to the level of who is responsible you have to persuade them to carry out the work that is needed the reply has always come back \u201cwe\u2019ve not got the money to do that\u201d there is no point in having the strategy if you are not going to be able to implement it you obviously have a fear about that could you expand on it a little", " from your experience in other areas how would this work would you prepare your strategy and go to the government to say that it will cost x and receive a reply such as \u201cwe will give you x minus 20 per cent\u201d", " mr rooke how do you feel clause 2 enables you to identify what a flood risk area is it strikes me as being very very unclear how would you assess what a flood risk area is", " the abi was extremely helpful during the floods and indeed has been since but there are one or two questions that i would like to put to mr starling if i may even now and i consider it will go on for quite a while people come to me to complain about their insurance premiums and their excesses to which mr horwood referred they cannot understand why both have gone up if the excess goes up to as much as \u00a320000 which i have known that effectively takes them out of insurance if they flood they will effectively pay for it themselves so why has the premium gone up they cannot understand why both have gone up they can probably understand why one or the other goes up or is the increased premium paying off the \u00a33 billion what are your thoughts on that", " are the increased premiums paying for the past though", " how would you assess risk there is a concern to which mr horwood referred particularly if you have a gl20 postcode which means more or less around the town of tewkesbury is the postcode put in a computer that flashes something back is it more scientific than that in some ways more worryingly if work is carried out in an area theoretically it will reduce the flood risk in that area but does it draw the attention of your members to that area and do they say \u201cwell it\u2019s flooded once they need to spend this amount of money on it it is bound to flood again\u201d how would they assess the risk to each householder", " it can be difficult for individuals to assess that and to provide that information it is not easy for them to do that", " my question is for miss bashford as i understand it there is already legislation that requires riparian owners to maintain waterways it quite often does not happen is there a need for this bill to revisit that legislation or do you think that the legislation is strong enough but is just not applied how would you assess it", " it is quite often individuals who are riparian owners that includes farmers\u2014it is not entirely farmers but it does include them again i have seen evidence where that has not happened where they have not done what they are supposed to have done in terms of maintenance and repair sometimes councils have an obligation to ensure that they do it but in some cases it is simply not working do you think we should revisit it", " in welcoming the bill i am concerned about how far it will go towards improving the fight against flooding and towards flood prevention i am concerned that it does not address a big issue to me as a representative of tewkesbury house building in floodrisk areasi have raised the question about pps25 many times it does not outlaw building in floodrisk areas in tewkesbury houses that were in the process of being built were flooded but it is not only the new houses flooding that is a problem the water displacement is also a problem as i speak now there are flooded fields in tewkesbury they flood several times every year if they were to be built on the flooding situation would be so much worse and that issue is not addressed in the billwhen we were trying to get repairs done to all sorts of waterways one of the great difficulties was finding out who was responsible for what is the minister satisfied that this bill identifies\u2014or enables identification to be made\u2014who is responsible for which waterwaysi am also concerned that we start to maintain waterways and not just involve ourselves in crisis management when there is a huge flood we have to go out and make repairs there was one area in my constituency where a culvert was broken and remained broken for a number of years there are also two culverts that should have been joined up but no one bothered to check them when the floods came many houses were flooded so we must ensure that maintenance is carried out is the minister satisfied that the bill will bring that abouta number of people in gloucestershire lost their mains water supply for up to three weeks i want to ensure that that does not happen again and that if we have a problem an alternative supply can be used the \u00a0situation i mentioned almost became much worse it was not just that some people lost their electricity supplies but the entire county came very close to losing its electricity supply during that time i want to see the bill address that particular issuefinally i understand that there will be separate flood risk management schemes for wales and england given tewkesbury\u2019s position and its rivers it suffers from water that starts off in wales and comes down to it i am not in any way blaming the welsh for that but given that there are separate flood risk management strategies who acts as the referee when there is a conflict or when england suffers from something that is decided in walesi welcome the bill because it at least gives us a chance to discuss such issues but there is a need to strengthen it if we are to achieve what mr horwood says about the buck stopping here who is responsible not only for clearing up the mess when flooding happens but for doing everything that can be done to prevent it from happening in the first place", " to take up that point a lot of our flooding did not come from rivers some did but a lot came from drains that were not working properly it came from green fields being taken up by housing which \u00a0should not have been built there one point the minister did not manage to touch on was the building of houses in the wrong places he got through many issues which i congratulate him on but he did not reach that one but mr horwood makes a very good point we had rivers running down roads and not just in one area and not only in july 2007 we have had it at other times as well it is a very real problem", "to ask the minister of state department for business innovation and skills what the role of the uk trade and investment defence and security organisation is in promoting arms sales and if he will make a statement", "what percentage of cases brought to court were not pursued for administrative reasons in the latest period for which figures are available", "in expressing my sadness at the death of mr david taylor i draw the attention of the house to the excellent work that he did on flood prevention which is a subject very dear to my hearti thank the minister for that response but does she agree that the figures that she gives are alarming the 18 per cent of cases which are dropped for whatever reason must represent a huge cost to the court clog up the courts system and prevent the most serious cases from being considered in a timely manner", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department when he expects to issue a visa to mr hapinderjit singh ref 2616562 what the reason is for the time taken to issue the visa and if he will make a statement", "given that this is the last northern ireland questions before the end of the arms amnesty on 9 february can the secretary of state give reasons for his reported belief that the uda will decommission some weapons over christmas when it is also reported that the uda is seeking assurances on the future of powersharing before it does so does the secretary of state agree that laying down such conditions is unacceptable because there is no reason or excuse for illegal arms to exist in any part of the united kingdom", "it is an honour to follow the hon member for sherwood paddy tippingi should like to start by thanking the secretary of statei suppose belatedly although i am sure that i said the same thing at the timefor all the help he gave to and interest he took in tewkesbury at the time of the floods he was extremely helpful he readily came over to visit and was always available on the phone that help was much appreciated by my constituents and again i thank him for iti am not taking it personally that i am the first speaker on the conservative benches to have his time curtailed i think that it is probably because i spoke in the queens speech debate on this issue however i make no apology for returning to it today because it is so very importanti want to run through a few aspects that are lacking from the bill or that i would like strengthened of course as has been said from the front bench conservative members support the bill we welcome its early introduction after the queens speech in the hope that we can get it through before parliament is dissolved for a general election however if we are to take advantage of its introduction there are changes that should be made i am sure that those decisions will be made in committeewe have heard a little about house building i entirely agree with the hon member for somerton and frome mr heath who said that we should not build houses in the wrong places he also mentioned the way in which houses are built the famous and iconic picture of tewkesbury abbey surrounded by water was seen everywhere people remember it in countries that i have been to all over the world it is important to point out that although the abbey was surrounded by water it did not flood the normans started to build the abbey at the end of the 11th century people knew where to build and how to build in those days it seems that we have forgotten about those skills we must try to build houses that are not only flood resistant but do not displace water and cause problems for other houses i am not sure whether it is entirely possible to do that although i know that new drainage systems are being discussed sumps have been mentioned tonight we must also start to build houses to take account of the power that they will require in the light of climate change i know that that is a different subject but we have talked a lot about it so it is relevantabove all we have to ask ourselves why my tewkesbury constituency suffered so badly the regional spatial strategy proposes to build 14500 extra houses in what is clearly a flood risk area those figures are based on what the southwest regional assembly is suggesting and on the governments projection that we need 3 million more houses by 2026 but there is no scientific basis for making those estimates when this government came to power they said correctly that they were going to end the predict and provide approach to housing but they have not only reinforced that approach but regionalised it thereby taking the decisions away from local people that is much to be regretted the hon member for cheltenham martin horwood who kindly mentioned several places in my constituency including warden hill leckhampton and wheatpieces was absolutely right to suggest that those new build figures should be revisited i believe that they should be scrapped and we should think again about where we are going to build houses in that respect i am not satisfied with the bill because i do not think it will stop the building of houses on flood risk areasanother important issue became evident during the fight to save the areai do not think that it is too dramatic to describe it as such given that some people lost up to three weeks water supply we almost lost the countys entire electricity supply and tragically we lost three lives it became obvious to me that it was extremely difficult to pinpoint which organisation was responsible for maintaining a waterway or water feature whether it be a culvert a stream a brook or whatever we want to call it as a result there was a delay in clearing or repairing that waterway which created great difficulty one of the reasons why people did not want to accept responsibility for a given waterway was that they would then have the responsibility for fixing it which costs money i am glad that several hon members have made that point when we set out to give responsibility to different organisations as we should we must ensure that we identify who is responsible for which waterway and that they are sufficiently funded to carry out the work that we require them to do i am not sure that the bill goes far enough to satisfy me in that respectas has been noted it is not enough to act only in emergencies welcome as that aid is at the time it is too late by then we need to ensure that all the waterways are maintained throughout the year as i said in the queens speech debate if we drive cars we should if we are sensible have them serviced regularly and not let them break down before we do anything with them it is the same with waterways we must ensure that they are cleared and maintained we must also ensurethis was not happening before the floodingthat riparian owners of certain waterways carry out their maintenance as far as i can see local authorities have not been doing thatas i said we lost the water supply and almost lost the electricity supply some people lost electricity for a while we need to provide alternative sources of utilities people in my constituency and i am sure in other constituencies had an extremely difficult time in going without water for so long the heroic efforts of the armed forces the emergency services and ordinary volunteers including children to get water supplies to houses warmed the heart nevertheless we do not want to have to go through that again i hope that alternative supplies of water and electricity can be set up at least we should ensure that places such as mythe waterworks and walham electricity substation are properly protectedthere are many other issues that i could raise but alas i am running out of time and cannot do so in any great detail on insurance of course as i said in an earlier intervention we must appreciate that insurance companies are businesses that must make profits we require them to exist so they have to be financially solvent however in some cases they have been unduly harsh on many of their customers by increasing excesses to as much as \u00a310000 or \u00a315000even \u00a320000 in a case that i have heard ofat the same time as increasing premiums if somebody has an excess of \u00a310000 or \u00a315000 for water damage they are effectively not insured against that so why do they have to pay an increased premium that is most unfair although it is welcome that flood defences are undertaken in so many placesseveral schemes have been completed in my own areathat can sometimes make things worse as regards getting insurance one or two companies may say oh that is a flood risk area those people are in dangerwe wont insure them or were going to put the excesses up that is very unfair i know that the government have expressed concern about that practice and i hope that they will carry on talking to insurance companies about it", "does the hon gentleman also agree that insurance companies should not be increasing the premium to the extent that they are doing and increasing the excess as he rightly points out if the excess is as much as \u00a310000 or \u00a315000 people are in effect not insured they are going to pay for the damage in any case so why does the premium have to go up too", "my hon friend is right to say that the operation in 2007 was the largest in peacetime but will he speculate on how much worse the situation would have been if the flooding had gone that little bit further and the entire county of gloucestershire had lost its electricity which it almost did that is a measure of how serious the situation was", "the secretary of state is right that what happens in one area can affect another but under the bill there will be separate flood management strategies for

nobody had touched on the issues that are his responsibility but when he sees me in the chamber he is well aware that i will talk about flooding which is very much his issuethe debate is wide ranging one can talk about energy as many hon members have and about climate change farming and many other issues i would have an interest in speaking on all those things but because of the shortness of time and the number of other hon members who want to speak i shall contain my remarks to floodingi represent tewkesbury which i am proud to do and obviously two and half years ago we had the most horrendous floods as did other parts of the country and because of that and because the problem is obviously very difficult i deeply sympathise with the people of cumbria i spoke to the hon member for workington tony cunningham for just a few minutes yesterday and he is obviously working extremely hard he soundedi say this in the nicest possible wayabsolutely exhausted by his efforts however he is unstinting and is carrying on doing the work that he needs to do i pay tribute to him and to all the other people who are working so hard i also send my deepest sympathies to the friends and families of those who have lost their lives we lost three people in tewkesbury because of the floods and it has a devastating effecti say this respectfully but anybody who has not been involved in any way or who has not been to visit people who have been flooded can fully understand the devastation that it causes in tewkesbury people were living in caravans for more than a year because of the floods that was remarkable in itself but what was in some ways even more remarkable was the spirit and resilience of those people everybody whom i went to see just before christmas of that year said oh dont worry about us were okay were not as badly off as some people they were living in caravansyoung people old people children and people who were seriously illand the flooding had a devastating effect but their spirit and resilience were not broken i am sure that that will be the case in cumbrialet me speak briefly about flooding and flood prevention i agree with my hon friend that legislation often does not put things right it is important to recognise that it is not the end but the beginning of the process i think that that was the point that she was striving to make when she spoke so excellently a few minutes ago that said i want the government to introduce the flood and water management bill early in this session it has been trailed for a long time and i hope that it is introduced fairly quickly because of course a general election is coming up in not too many months even if we run to the latest time that does not give us an awful lot of time to carry out the legislative programme that the government want to introduce i hope that the bill comes forward quickly one slightly good thing to come out of the tragic events in cumbria might be that the bill will be given parliamentary time very soonit is also important that the bill is given sufficient time to be considered far too often we rush legislation through when we really do not need to an awful lot of time is wasted in this house and we should give more time to considering the legislation in detail particularly in committee and on report", "i am grateful to the hon lady for that intervention to be honest introducing the bill in recognition of what is taking place in cumbria is the least that we can do for the people who are suffering thereanother reason i want to introduce the bill early is that i fear that it is somewhat lacking i am afraid that i am not as enthusiastic about it as the hon lady is it seems very strong on requiring people to produce reports assessments and all these other buzz words i am not sure that there is the detailed requirement for action that we needone of the actions that we need was briefly mentioned by my hon friend when we had the floods in tewkesbury and gloucestershire one of the great difficulties that we had in trying to help people and to get things fixed was determining who was responsible for which waterway it was very difficult if not impossible to determine who was responsible there were two reasons for that partly those involved genuinely did not know and once they had accepted responsibility they had to pay to put it right and they claimed to be short of money for those two reasons defining responsibility was very difficult however it was crucial and we must address that i am not sure that the bill does so fully i hope that it does and perhaps if there is sufficient time in committee we can explore that and the bill can be strengthened at that stage for that reasonit is also important to ensure that whoever is responsible for which waterway does not just repair things when something has gone wrong it is important to maintain the waterways on an ongoing basis each and every year that simply is not happening i was not flooded in tewkesbury but my house was full of people who were they lived further up the hill than i do so they should not have been flooded however a drain was broken the problem did not show up when there was ordinary rainfall but it did when there was heavy rainfall the drain had not been maintained and we then went into the process of working out who was responsible for it the county council denied responsibility but it was then proved that it was its responsibility and it had to fix it but it was too latethe family had already been floodedwe must have maintenance as well as repair work of course repair work is involved in maintenance nobody would have a car that they never serviced and expect it to run for ever until it got to the point where it absolutely broke down the job is far more expensive then than if services are carried out every 15000 miles or so we would not do that and we should not do it in this respect eitheranother issue that i want to mention is one that i have brought up many times which is building houses in floodrisk areas whenever we raise the issue locally or nationally we hear the old theories such as whether it is a floodrisk area or whether it has flooded in the past 100 years on the one hand we are told that we are experiencing climate change and i am not denying that but if we are experiencing climate change we cannot use the old figures of once in 100 years once in 500 years and once in 1000 years we cannot have it both ways we do not know when the rain will fall in the way that it did in 2007 or the way that it did in the past few weeks", "i am grateful to my hon friend for that intervention he is absolutely right we can all draw maps and i have seen maps that are manifestly wrong we have given photos of flooded areas to the people who produced the maps that say that those areas do not flood and planning permission has been granted on appeal for that very land but the floods in that area will be even worse in the future we cannot work from some of the maps that have been drawn", "the hon gentleman is absolutely right and i know the estate that he is talking about it flooded as it was being built and then an application was put in to build 100 more houses on that very site the second bit of the building application has not gone through but the first didi am not willing at this stage to lay too much blame at the door of the local authorities they know what happens the hon member for bassetlaw john mann is smiling but i remind him that no party has overall control of the tewkesbury authorityi think that that is what he is getting atplanning policy statement 25 is insufficient it says that authorities should not build in floodrisk areas unless this or that is the case but it is far too weak a document to provide the protection that we need", "my hon friend makes a good point however i thinki will have to look it upthat local authorities have been given that power only very recently", "i certainly would not describe tewkesbury local authority as colourless it might have no overall control but it is certainly not colourless however the hon gentleman makes a point that although slightly different from mine is important what he describes is a consideration albeit a very shortterm one", "as i said i think that pps25 is inadequate because it does not provide the protection that we need the hon gentleman is therefore absolutely right", "my hon friend is absolutely right and she very conveniently takes me on to the next point which concerns the pressure placed on local authorities by the regional spatial strategywhen this government came to power they said that they wanted to end the predict and provide approach to housing like me many hon members will remember that statement i thought there we go im not going to be able to disagree with everything that this government say however they have not only reinforced that approach but regionalised it they have reinforced it by making it a requirement to build 3 million extra houses over the next 20 years or so but how did they know that we would need that many houses in that period why has the power to decide how many houses are needed and where they should go been handed to the regions the decisions are almost sitespecific but i do not know who is making them it is not local councillors because if it were we could go to them and say we disagree with you and were going to boot you out next time because we dont like what youre doing we cannot do that with the rssin my constituency the proposal in the rss is to build more than 14000 houses how on earth can we find space for all those houses when the area concerned is a flood risk i do not care whether we are just on one side or the other of a line on a map because that is not what is important as the hon member for northwest leicestershire david taylor mentioned the planning process does not take account of the theory of water displacementit is not only a matter of whether the new houses flood when the hon gentleman visited tewkesbury the new houses flooded as they were being built but the other problem is that they also displace water and send it somewhere else the water in tewkesbury is as we speak resting on green fields it does that quite frequently as certain parts of the fields in the town flood several times a year that is not a problem but concreting over those green fields causes that water to go somewhere elsei was never big on science at school but the theory is pretty obviousthe water is going to go somewhere else it is profoundly wrong and dangerous for the rss to propose that 14000 houses be built in my area the people who put the strategy together do not live there and obviously have not studied it because they do not know what they are talking aboutit is not just in my area that there have been objections to the rss the secretary of state will know that in the southwest region there have been 35000 representations about that document for very many different reasons the document is fairly technical and is not necessarily something that people wake up with in the morning people do not normally get involved in responding to the rss but 35000 have", "i am not sure that my party has said that as i understand the policy it is to scrap the regional assemblies and the rss process i agree with the hon gentleman that that will not necessarily be absolutely perfect or a utopia and i am sure that i will still have disputes and arguments with my frontbench team or local councils but at least i will know who i am arguing with and what the process is to me that is far more honest than the system that we have nowthe people of the northeast were asked whether they wanted elected regional assemblies and they said no what have the government done they have carried on devolving powers to regional assemblies that are unelected that cannot be the right way to gobecause of all the interventions which i have been very glad to take i have spoken for far longer than i intended i shall end with two very quick points the first of which has been mentioned since the floods in my area some people have not been able to get insurance and others have had to pay vastly increased premiums as the hon member for cheltenham martin horwood said some have had to cover extraordinarily high excess payments i had a telephone call today about someone with an excess of \u00a320000 on his house in effect that means that that person is not insured against flooding because it would probably not cost more than that to fix the damagethe insurance industry of course is a business that has to fund itself and make itself pay but i wish insurance companies could be a bit more flexible and understanding i do not know whether the government can help in that regard or whether they have had discussions with the industry i presume that they have but a bit more flexibility and understanding would not go amissmy final point has to do with water supplies i do not know what the situation is in cumbria but we in tewkesbury lost our water supplies as a result of the floods some people were without water for up to three weeks and the entire county came very close losing its electricity supply i understand that the problems in gloucestershire amounted to the largest peacetime emergency that this country has ever had but can the house imagine how much worse it would have been if we had lost our entire electricity supply if it is possible to provide alternative water and power supplies such systems certainly should be in place as well as the protective barriers that can be built around those utilitiesi send my deepest sympathies to the people of workington i can put my hand on my heart and say that i know what people there are going through i sincerely hope that they come through the experience with the same spirit and resilience as my constituents did", "my hon friend talks about the weakness of the energy bill but he will recall that the government passed the energy act 2004 i had the honour of leading for the opposition on that bill and while it did a few useful things it entirely disregarded the problem that we are facing", "to ask the secretary of state for communities and local government what assessment he has made of the effectiveness in notifying the public of planning applications of

uk freight industry of changes in the taxation of aviation", "a constituent of mine is a breeder of alpacas have the government looked into the spreading of bovine tb to alpacas is there an appropriate test to ascertain whether that is happening and if so is there an appropriate compensation scheme", "i too congratulate the right hon member for belfast east mr robinson on introducing the debate i agree with the minister that he spoke in a reasonable and measured way which is appropriate given the sensitivities in northern ireland in general and particularly on this subjecti agreed with much of what the minister said and i thank him for being available to discuss these issues and for having an opendoor policy when it comes to matters involving northern ireland whether it be in the chamber or when we discuss statutory instruments as we often do i believe that we will be back together next week to discuss one or two more and i look forward to thatthe right hon member for belfast east was absolutely right to draw attention to the fact that everyone has the right to assemble to march and to protest peacefully the minister reinforced that point freedom of speech and expression is a timehonoured tradition and we should never dispense with it or endanger it additionally we have to understand that in northern ireland expression through marches has cultural and historic importancean important matter to which the motion draws attentionas the right hon gentleman saidthe figures are worth repeatingin 200708 the parades commission received notification of 3849 parades of which only 250 were contentious of those only 147 had conditions applied to them as he said less than 4 per cent of the parades were of real concern that said 147 parades being seen as contentious or difficult and having to have conditions attached to them is a large number even if a small percentageit is important for sensitivity to accompany both the debate and any march or protest and to be demonstrated on both sides as everybody knows northern ireland has two very different cultures with different views but we have to move forward together and recognise that we are trying to build a shared future sensitivity and respect on both sides is therefore important we have made the most enormous progress in northern ireland and we should pay tribute to all the political parties that have taken part in the democratic debates and to the people of northern ireland the fact that the people had had enough of the troubles was one of the most telling factors that enabled the province to move forwardwe still feel however that there is a need for a body to take decisions on parades even if that body is not the parades commission as such we are aware that the commission may not command respect throughout northern ireland but the minister was right to draw attention to the fact that it has done a great deal of good work importantly it took the responsibility for deciding on parades away from the police leaving them to look after the parades without having to make the rules about them however it does not enjoy complete support it has some but we want to engage with the people of northern ireland in deciding what should replace it and how we should move oni spoke to the minister earlier and as i understand ithe may wish to confirm thisit is for this house in westminster to decide what will replace the parades commission if we are so minded it is also for this house to devolve decision making on parades to northern ireland as i understand it that does not happen automatically with the devolution of policing and justice i would be grateful if at some point in the debate the minister could confirm that i am right", "i am grateful to the minister for that responseeven if we are taking those decisions here which the minister has confirmed it is extremely important that we talk to the political parties in northern ireland and other people there who are involved i recently had a meeting with the orange order whose members expressed their concerns to me about the process i listened to what they said and i am happy to meet anyone in northern ireland to discuss those issues those people must have a large input into the processwe believe that the interim ashdown report provides the ideas on which we can build it would be unwise to take too many decisions until we have the final report which we look forward to afterwards however we intend to consult widely with people in northern ireland to see what they think is the way forwardat this stage of the interim report however we have a concern with great respect to the first minister who introduced this debate we are not convinced that it would be right for him and the deputy first minister to decide on parades given how things are set up at the moment there is in effect a fourparty coalition in the assembly and we perhaps believe that those decisions should be taken more neutrallyi shall draw my remarks to a conclusion because a number of people want to speak in this very short debate i want to finish by agreeing with the right hon member for belfast east and the minister parading should not be used as a political football or to score points off each other we are talking about a very sensitive issue and about peoples lives being affected the right hon gentleman has already mentioned the quote with which i shall finish as lord ashdown said the vision must be fora situation where over time parades and assemblies in ni can be regulated in the same way as they would be in any other european democracywe want those decisions taken locally but we also want to continue the process of moving northern ireland towards the normal politics that we enjoy in the rest of the

then make one or two personal comments having discussed the matter with my partyor certainly a number of people in itwe take the view that this is a matter for the devolved assembly as has been pointed out the devolved assembly cannot take that decision at the moment because policing and criminal justice remains a reserved matter as the hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry recognised there were good reasons for reserving such matters to westminster it was to do not with keeping control over abortion but with the terrorist situation that had existed in northern ireland for very many years none the less there are moves to devolve policing and criminal justicethe target date as set out in the st andrews agreement was may 2008 that date was not set in legislation but that was the target of course we have gone somewhat beyond that because there was not sufficient confidence in the community to devolve such issues but the matter is back on the agenda i have had meetings with representatives of all the political parties in northern ireland some very recently and they say that the decisions on devolving policing and justice are imminent and will probably go through if such a decision goes through the conservative party does not intend to oppose the devolution of policing and justice we will accept that they have decided to devolve those issues when it gets to that stage the northern ireland assembly can decide on abortionthey cannot at the moment because it is a matter of criminal justice and not health we take the view that that is the right way to proceedi have every respect for the minister but i hope that he will allow me a little criticism for the way in which the government dealt with some issues in northern ireland before the assembly was restored decisions were taken in committee in this house on matters such as local government reform and education reform in advance of the assembly being restored that was wrong those decisions should not have been taken here in advance of the assembly being restored they should have been left to the assembly i take the same view on the issue under debate i am very happy to discuss it but decisions should not be taken in advance of the devolution of policing and criminal justice especially as all the main parties in northern ireland are united on this one issue and no other i have been doing this job for fourandahalf years and can remember no other issue on which all the parties were united for us to take legislative steps that not only undermined the role of the assembly but went against everything that all the political parties in northern ireland are saying would be wrong and somewhat antidemocraticthe hon member for reading west martin salter said that he had campaigned for the belfast agreement he went down the falls road and other such places for which i commend him i had some reservations about the agreement and expressed them at the time but he supported it and he supported devolution let us complete the devolution and let the people of northern ireland decide", "there is a case for reviewing the upper limits of abortion i voted to reduce the limits my hon friend prompts me to express my personal views i agree with the sentiments expressed by members of the democratic unionist and the social and democratic labour parties in the debate seventeen years ago i worked in connection with a special care baby unit even at that time babies were surviving after 24 weeks gestation they are now aborted and actually survive outside the womb only to die in the most cruel circumstances i simply cannot accept that that is righti am quite assured that there is now abortion on demandquite illegallyin great britain i take the view put forward by the hon member for upper bann david simpson who said that if anything we should be tightening the abortion law across great britain and moving away from the current situation last year alone there were 216000 abortions in great britain i simply cannot accept that many abortions are not carried out for social reasons we all know of social excuses for abortions and we all know that we are not simply talking about teenage children who cannot cope", "i always look forward to hearing the minister so i will bring my speech to an end my hon friend makes another powerful pointconservative front

neighbour in gloucestershire the hon member for cheltenham martin horwood also wishes to speak i would not dream of taking too long i congratulate the hon member for southport dr pugh on securing this debate it is a slight variation on the one that i secured before the easter recess which was about the future of pubs more generally i requested that debate because of the figure of 39 pubs that are closing a week\u2014i think that the hon gentleman said 40 but we shall not argue about that whichever number it is it is very alarming in that debate i tried to explore some of the reasons for the pub closuresi will return to the pubco situation in a moment but i do not think that we should let the government off the hook as lightly as we seem willing to do they have been well aware of the number of pubs that are closing they increased the cost of alcohol last year and have done it again in the budget when they put vat back up to 175 per cent\u2014as they surely will\u2014the cost will go up yet again they do not seem to be aware of what they are doing and it is important to remember that then we have the supermarkets i have nothing against supermarkets that sell alcohol as a loss leader they sell it very cheaply and it is consumed very responsibly by some and less responsibly by others that is what the pubs must face a number of other measures have caused the pubs to close on the back of that and now that the minister has returned i will say again that we should not let the government off the hook they are helping to close pubs and should not continue to do so through the taxation policy that they follow they take almost \u00a315 billion a year in taxation from the drinks industry and they should not squeeze it any more than they already havenormally when i stand up to speak in this place i have a particular point to make i am not quite sure where i stand on pubcos so one might ask why bother speaking in the first place well in the couple of minutes that i have left i want to say that we need to balance the debate a little more than it has been balanced today i really come down on the side of my right hon friend the member for northwest hampshire sir george young who says that we should probably look at this issue a little more cautiously i want to see the conclusions that the select committee reaches when it publishes the results of its inquiry at the moment i would not rush into abolishing the tiei am a regular patron of pubs and i have listened to many pub landlords who say we have got to get rid of the pubcos however they all seem to rush towards the pubcos when they want to take the pubs on and i wonder whether a strengthening of their position through their own actions might be a better way forward i understand what my right hon friend says which is that the government can intervene in free markets and he gave many examples where that has been the case i understand that point none the less we really ought to be very careful on this issue we all want to achieve the same thing but i remember that the beer orders\u2014i think that i am right in saying that they were introduced in 1989\u2014did not achieve what they were meant to achieve the last thing that i want to do is introduce further legislation\u2014wellintended legislation as most legislation is\u2014and not solve the problem but actually make things worse it is possible that we could do thatwe must look at all the considerations for example would it be better if companies simply rented out the premises and did not have an arrangement with regards to beer or would that lead to rent being a lot higher than it is now we have to consider all these elements before we rush to judgment on this issuei do not want to take up any more time i know that the hon member for cheltenham wishes to speak however i just want to urge a little caution about this issue yes let us look at it extremely carefully i am well aware of the complaints that are made against pubcos and i do not seek to represent pubcos at all nevertheless i think that we should engage with pubcos to discuss the way forwardi am a member of the allparty save the pub group and the allparty beer group we have discussed these issues with licensees but we should also discuss them with pubcos and see if there is not a better way forward before we rush towards introducing what could be inappropriate

there are on the police to render computers secure following such searches and if she will make a statement", "i thank mr speaker for awarding me this debate and the minister for staying behind to reply to it i say affectionately to the minister that the pub industry and certain products in which it deals are close to his heart as they are to mine we share a number of interests including horse racing and the odd social half hour in the bar downstairs i am delighted that this minister is replying to the debate i am also grateful to the british beer and pub association and the allparty beer group my hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans a member of the group is here today to take part in the debate i should also thank my local landlord mr david baker of the village inn in twyning for advice facts and figuresobviously pubs are historic institutions and go back many centuries the royal hop pole in my constituency was mentioned by charles dickens in the pickwick papers pubs represent a big industry there are more than 62000 in great britain today and 84 per cent of them are familyrun businesses which adds a certain importance to them i notice that the hon member for selby mr grogan chairman of the allparty beer group is here i paid tribute to it a moment agopubs are extremely valuable to communities they act as meeting places and many friendships are formed in them many groups are set up through pubs\u2014pub football teams and golf societies for example fairly recently i managed to win the tournament put on by my local golf society i was very proud of that", "i can tell my hon friend that yes others did enterpubs play host to skittles matches card games dominos darts and pool as well as many other activities they are headquarters for various societies and\u2014even more so these days\u2014provide meals for families and individuals in fact almost 40 per cent of pubs turnover comes from food sales people watch sports in pubs and pubs provide supervised drinking an important point to which i will return in a minute some provide wonderful examples of fine architecture and many raise money for charities furthermore they are particularly although not exclusively important in rural areas they have been described as a uniquely british institutionpubs also make an important economic contribution particularly through tax according to the house of commons library the drinks industry alone contributes \u00a31479 billion a year each pub contributes an average of about \u00a390000 in taxes which is an awful lot of money when we next go to our local pub we should think about the \u00a390000 contributed just by that pub we will then realise pubs economic value to the country as well as to the community at a time when people who enjoy a social drink are under pressure because of the misuse of alcohol by the few we should remember how much money people who enjoy a drink contribute to the exchequersome 350000 people are directly employed by pubs but a large number are also indirectly employed by them on average each pub contributes about \u00a33000 to charities in their areas i pay tribute to all the landlords and landladies who have run such fine institutions over the years and provided such a great contribution to their communitiesalas however there are problems and that is the main reason for my wanting to hold this debate i am thinking particularly of pub closures pubs are closing at a rate of 39 every single week that is bad enough but an even bigger problem is that the rate is accelerating since the last budget more than 2000 pubs have closed costing the government \u00a3180 million in lost revenue with the loss of 20000 jobs\u2014that is a lot of jobs to lose in my own constituency 11 pubs have closed since june 2005 including one very recently that i really would not have expected to close of course in some areas where the market might be saturated a few pub closures are to be expected now and again but this trend represents more than that and it is very worrying i would suggest that there are other reasons for it apart from the economic downturn which obviously is not helping any business i will name just a few high tax competition with supermarkets pubcos which are the organisations that own the pubs the weak pound to some extent and the smoking ban all those problems have contributed i should like to take each of them in turnthere are two worries as regards tax it is sometimes difficult to get exact figures for tax on beer but it seems that it accounts for 28 per cent of the price of a pint in the pub over the years the sale of beer has declined dramatically now there is the question of what the chancellor of the exchequer will do in a few weeks time in his budget it is feared that the escalator that was imposed which meant that beer duty would increase by the retail prices index plus 2 per cent will create further problems for the pub industry a while ago vat was reduced for almost all goods and services across the country but that did not apply to drinks\u2014beer in particular\u2014because the duty was put up to ensure that the price of alcohol did not fall the beer industry did not get any boost from that reduction in vat\u2014although i doubt that any industry did as it was a futile measure\u2014because it together with smoking was singled out as an area that should not benefit that is bad enough but when vat is restored to 175 per cent it will face an even bigger increase because the duty was adjusted when the rate was reducedi do not have anything against supermarkets but there are two problems first their provision of very cheap alcohol usually through using it as a lossleader to get people into them in the first place and secondly their power of purchase also used against farmers which enables them to refuse to accept increases that breweries might feel the need to pass on to them even when the tax paid by the brewery has gone up all the people who buy from supermarkets then drink unsupervised pubs provide a supervised forum for drinking supermarkets do not underage people are often\u2014not always by any means\u2014able to get alcohol from supermarkets very cheaply and cause trouble in communities as a result in pubs tax forms about 28 per cent of a pint of beer in supermarkets and in the off trade generally it forms 50 per cent that reflects the different prices that are charged i am informed that in the 1990s the onoff ratio\u2014the price in a pub compared with the price outside the pub\u2014was 21 now it is 71 the very cheap alcohol that is available in supermarkets has a big effect in terms of social behaviour as well as on pubsthere is also the question of pubcos punch taverns enterprise inns and many other companies own pubs that were once owned by breweries bass for example which was a brewer but also a pub owner had 7190 pubs in 1989 in 2007 punch taverns had 9095 pubs the ownership of pubs is very different now why is that important all four or five of us in the chamber today realise that a monopolistic situation exists\u2014vertical integration might be a better way to describe it the select committee on business and enterprise finished a report on that recently but unfortunately it has not been published\u2014we look forward to it i am not against pubcos but the fact that they act as a middleman buying beer and then charging extra for providing it to pubs which could get it directly from the breweries if they were not tied to the pubco makes beer a lot more expensive for those who go into pubs and we can see that the situation is worse for pubs when we compare their prices to those of supermarkets i referred to my own pub and punch taverns recently ordered a 10p a pint increase there because of the pressure it is subject to from breweries due to extra tax pressure but it could add a bit more if it so wished that said only 14 per cent of closures are of pubs owned by any of the top six pubcos i am not saying that they do not do a good job in some cases but i am highlighting a difficultyi mentioned the weak pound i do not want to say too much about that but if we buy alcohol from abroad it will be dearer i now come to the smoking ban i realise that this will be the most contentious part of my speech but that has never worried me before i spoke against the ban on smoking in public places not because i do not respect the right of people to enjoy themselves in smokefree environments but because i felt that it was up to the local landlord to know his potential customers and decide what was best for them there can be no doubt that beer sales have fallen there may be a few extra people who come into pubs because they are smokefree\u2014i do not think that there are many\u2014but we could have had highquality extractor units and separate areas in pubs and things could have been so much better i do not mean this discourteously but if people are fairweather patrons of pubs they do not spend much money they are entitled to sit in the corner with an orange juice all night\u2014that is their privilege and i defend their right to do so\u2014but that does not keep the pubs going it is the more regular patrons such as myself and many others who provide more of the moneyanother aspect of that problem relates to the supermarkets selling alcohol very cheaply people might be persuaded to stay at home drinking cheap and probably stronger alcohol in greater measures while smoking in front of children previously they would have smoked in a pub in front of adults who had a choice of whether to be there or not the ban has not helped in any respectrate relief and rural rate relief are helpful but are seen as rather inadequate because qualifying levels are far too low they are also discretionary and perhaps they should be mandatory business rates will increase by 5 per cent in a few days time across the board including for pubs even though that increase is based on septembers retail prices index i do not think there is an rpi at the moment\u2014i think that it is nil\u2014but there will still be an increase which seems unfair", "i agree with the hon gentleman that would help although it would not entirely rescue the situation we must consider the position of small businesses they have to pay money out before they have earned any that payment is not based on their activity and they really are in a difficult situation i hope that the government will do something about that", "my hon friend is absolutely right i have seen examples of that situation which has a bad effect my sister has a bar in spain and when there is a world cup tournament on or cricket football or whatever it is the takings rise greatly if that facility cannot be made available by pubs in this country for the reasons that my hon friend gives it is a setbacki suggest that there should be no increase in alcohol tax in the budget i know that the government are looking to get back the billions of pounds that the prime minister has spent on rescuing failing banks and now on effectively printing money but i think that an increase would be counterproductive oxford economics estimates that an increase would cost a further 75000 jobs over the next two years which is a lot of jobs those people would then be unemployed and the situation would get worse the tax should be frozen actually i would like it to be reduced particularly on beer i do not suppose that the government will do that but the situation is certainly becoming urgent when 39 pubs a week are closing if people continue to turn away from pubs it will be counterproductive from a health point of view because supermarkets will fill the void in a dangerous wayi was pleased to hear the prime minister say recently when there was a suggestion of a minimum price per unit of alcohol that other methods should be chosen to counter the problems that are related perhaps to alcohol but more particularly to peoples bad behaviour that is what we should put them down to yes the low price of alcohol is fuelling the problems in certain places but we should not lose sight of the fact that it is peoples bad behaviour that is causing themwe would like to see as all small businesses would an end to the dripdrip regulation that affects all businesses but small ones disproportionately we need to allow diversification\u2014perhaps post offices could be put in pubs\u2014and we need a simplified planning system for smaller planning applications i have said that mandatory rate relief should be considered and there should not be any increase in business rates this year as i said the inflation figure is now nil anywayi stand to be corrected but i understand that the government have not yet responded to the excellent report on the community pub inquiry produced by my hon friend and his team perhaps they could respond to the excellent suggestions in it i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say and i thank him again for attending pubs are well worth saving for the reasons that i have given\u2014their economic value and their value to the community to pinch a quotation from my hon friends excellent report the writer and onetime mp hilaire belloc saidwhen you have lost your inns drown your empty selves for you will have lost the last of englandi think he had it about right", "if he will take steps to increase the number of nhs dentists in gloucestershire and if he will make a statement", "it is difficult to calculate how many people are registered with an nhs dentist since the new contract was established perhaps the minister could give us some idea of how many people are registered in gloucestershire and nationally registration is patchy in my tewkesbury constituency a relatively small number of people are registered with nhs dentists even when compared to other constituencies in gloucestershire and especially when the national figure is taken into account what can the minister do to help the local pct to increase that number", "to ask the minister of state department for business enterprise and regulatory reform what recent discussions he has had with business organisations on the availability of finance for businesses and if he will make a statement", "what recent estimate he has made of the proportion of firsttime offenders found guilty of burglary offences who are given custodial sentences and if he will make a statement", "i am grateful to the minister for that reply although i think that burglary has increased more recently when i raised the matter on 3 february the justice secretary said that the lord chief justice had issuedvery strong guidance to sentencers on burglary\u2014 official report 3 february 2009 vol 487 c 697he also said that there would be a toughening up of sentencing policy however the key points in that sentencing document include the followingprevious convictions and the record of an offender are of more significance than in the case of some other crimeswhat exactly does that mean it seems like a weakening rather than a strengthening of sentencing policy", "to ask the secretary of state for health what steps he is taking to increase  a medical practitioners and  b public awareness of premature ovarian failure and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department what estimate she has made of the number of failed asylum seekers living in the uk and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for health how much nhs funding was

much revenue has accrued to the exchequer from the tax on the sale of  a beer and  b other alcoholic drinks sold in public houses in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available", "on a point of order sir alan my hon friend the member for huntingdon mr djanogly is not a member of the northern ireland frontbench team", "the fact that there was a review several years ago does not bind us today that said we try to deal with these matters on a crossparty basis given the advice of the secretary of state the minister the first minister and the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee\u2014and given the misunderstanding no doubt our fault that led to my hon friend the member for huntingdon not being able to contribute\u2014we would like to reserve the right to return to the issue in another place i will not press the amendment to a division", "as previously indicated and for the reasons that i gave we will not press the amendment to a vote we reserve the right to consider it further over the next few days but we will not press it to a vote tonight debate interrupted order this day the chairman put forthwith the question already proposed from the chair order this day that the amendment be made question negatived the chairman then put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be concluded at that time order this day clause 3 ordered to stand part of the bill clauses 4 and 5 ordered to stand part of the bill", "i beg to move amendment 10 in clause 3 page 2 line 17 at end add\u20144 section 22 of the justice northern ireland act 2002 is amended as follows\u2014a for subsection 2 substitute\u20142 the attorney general for northern ireland shall be appointed by the lord chief justice and the provisions of section 5 as amended shall have effect for the procedure governing such appointment5 in the justice northern ireland act 2002 omit section 41", "we have reached the amendments rather earlier than i had anticipated but i am not complaining about that nevertheless i want to tell the government that we are still short of timewe have talked a lot about strengthening the independence of the judiciary one of our proposals is that the attorneygeneral for northern ireland should be appointed by the lord chief justice on the advice of the judicial appointments commission and not by politicians i know that when the right hon member for belfast east mr robinson intervened at an earlier stage i said that i would return to that point i have since had a brief word with him to clarify his concern we have talked about the matter and we feel that our amendment is probably the best way forward i cannot go into all the details now as i do not have time but if we get time later we can return to that point we have discussed the matter with our shadow attorneygeneral we have had extensive discussions about the amendment and we feel that it would improve the bill we believe that the amendment would have the added advantage of strengthening the principle of devolution as the independent nature of the appointments system free from political interference would stabilise a very sensitive processwe are also concerned about how under the proposed model the director of public prosecutions after devolution would be left without supervision or protection by a person accountable to the assembly we agree that his role should be made independent and free from politicians but the government propose creating a hybrid that in effect would leave him entirely unaccountable and unprotectedthe dpp has far reaching powers his is a very powerful role\u2014for example he can enter a nolle prosequi application or decide to prosecute or to stop criminal proceedings\u2014yet he is answerable to no one he may carry out his functions how he wishes and he would be removed only in extreme circumstances such as if he were totally failing to carry out his role we do not believe that that should be the case the dpp like other members of public bodies and the judiciary should be capable of being held accountable we propose that he should enjoy the supervision of the attorneygeneral for northern ireland on devolved matters and of the advocategeneral on reserved mattersour amendment would have the added advantage of providing the dpp with a colleague who could speak for his department in the assembly in great britain the attorneygeneral is a member of the government and can speak in parliament on behalf of the crown prosecution service so we feel that the dpp should have the same protection in northern ireland we feel more strongly about this part of the bill than about most others", "we have not had a huge amount of time but we have studied the matter to the extent that we were able we are still persuaded that we are putting forward a better argument", "well\u2014", "certainly", " rose\u2014", "i can respond very simply to my hon friend the member for huntingdon mr djanogly we have of course discussed the matter and i agree entirely with him", "our great difficulty with the bill as it stands is that we believe that the dpp will be accountable to no one and we cannot accept that we also see that he will be completely unprotected by anyone able to report to the assembly that is the basis for our argumentmy hon friend the member for huntingdon has momentarily left his seat but i know that he will be seeking to catch your eye sir alan perhaps he and the secretary of state will be able to attack each other without me having to act as referee but i have set out the basis for our objection to the bill as it stands", "i am grateful for the way in which the secretary of state is attempting to persuade me not to press the amendment to a division but we have discussed the issue as far as parliamentary time would allow he tried very gently to persuade me not to push the case so i will respond as gently as i can we have all been put in a difficult position not only by todays unnecessarily tight timetable but by the timetable under which the bill was laid before parliament i know that the secretary of state delayed its introduction for one week but we still had very little time to discuss it nevertheless we have certainly consulted the document to which he refers and we are concerned about the fact that the dpp would be in a difficult position if our amendment were not carried", "i understand my hon friends concerns on the matter we have carried out a great deal of consultation on the subject the advice that we were given which may contradict the advice in the document to which the secretary of state refers was that we really should revisit a situation in which the dpp is unsupervised and unprotected", "i understand that we have 17 minutes left and i know that one or two other hon members wish to contribute to this debate of course we will listen to what they have to say but i think that i have made the case for what we are proposing and i shall leave the matter there", "the secretary of state has dealt with one of our amendments\u2014that relating to the independence of the judiciary and the police\u2014but he has not really spoken to amendments 5 and 6 regarding the time limit for appointment both now and after an assembly election may i invite him to do so", "i wish briefly to place on record our opinion that this part of the bill is actually the most agreeable largely for the reasons given by the hon member for belfast north mr dodds and especially given the difficult negotiations that have taken place up to this point it is my understanding that the question of who appoints the judiciary has been one of the sticking points and it is therefore important that politicians are taken out of the process of selection or dismissal of the judiciary the principle of separation of powers comes to mind but given the sensitive situation in northern ireland this is the best way forward i am therefore afraid that we cannot support the hon member for belfast south dr mcdonnell if he presses this issue", "i want to speak fairly briefly because we are short of time and i raised one or two issues on second reading as i said we welcome this model it appears to us to be the best of the eight models but we are concerned about one or two things the hon member for thurrock andrew mackinlay has reinforced the arguments about the openended nature of the situation if policing and justice were devolved later this year\u2014i hope that that will happen if the circumstances are right\u2014how long would it take for a minister to be in position the hon gentleman is right that any department needs a head whether we call them a leader a director a minister or something else otherwise how can it function if it can function perfectly well without that head why should we have any ministers at all that is the logical conclusion of the argumentwe believe that there has to be a head of department we also believe that because of the special and difficult circumstances in northern ireland and because this move is ground breaking it is inconceivable that there should not be a minister to oversee the department after an assembly election there are seven days in which all the other ministers can be appointed yet there is no time limit for this particular appointment of course given the difficulties and sensitivities it could take more than the normal seven days to fill the position we also recognise that discussions have been going on about who would be suitable\u2014perhaps i should say acceptable\u2014in the role it could be that that person did not win their seat back after an election so we would have to start all over again it could take a bit longer than seven daysthe time limit that we are suggesting is six months according to the discussions that we have had that is probably a long time too it probably is too long but i wanted to put down some time limit and it is very difficult to come up with one given the record of deadlines being broken in northern ireland\u2014the right hon member for neath mr hain who is not in his place but has contributed to the debate famously broke two absolutely unbreakable deadlines the year before last\u2014we know that it is difficult to impose deadlines however we already have a deadline for the appointment of the other ministers and i suggest that we ought to have a deadline for the appointment of this minister as the hon member for thurrock said that would concentrate minds on what is absolutely necessary if nothing elsewe are concerned about the immediate appointment if devolution takes place before the next assembly elections we are also concerned about the appointment after the next assembly elections so we tabled amendments 5 6 and 8 which address those points amendment 8 refers to the time limits that can be taken to fill the office once the devolution order has been made while amendment 5 requires the office to be filled within six months of the assemblys first meeting after an assembly electionin amendment 6 we propose a default position this is a difficult matter as we want policing and justice to be devolved as i have said repeatedly it would therefore be deeply unsatisfactory to return the powers to the secretary of state but given the nature of the problem in northern ireland that would probably be the least bad of all the options the hon member for thurrock has made his own suggestions about a fallback position i listened to him extremely carefully and do not have violent disagreements with what he said but i think that i prefer our amendmentsamendment 9 refers to what would happen after 1 may 2012 if the justice department were dissolved again i would consider it rather unsatisfactory if that happened i would very much prefer it if the assembly voted to extend the present model beyond 2012 or if it chose another one but once again we need to consider what a fallback position might be in amendment 9 i have proposed the same one that would apply if the ministers were not appointed either now or after the assembly election\u2014that is that control of policing and justice would come back to this place again i think that that would be highly unsatisfactory although i do not believe that it will happen the delicate negotiations that have allowed us to get as far as we have lead me to believe that we are starting to build on ground that is rather more substantial than sand i hope that we do not get to the position where the proposed fallback would applylike the hon member for thurrock i do not know exactly what would be dissolved if the department were dissolved who would give direction and carry out the administration i listened very carefully as the minister of state who has momentarily left the chamber explained what would happen he said that the assembly would be charged with coming up with another model or reaching some further agreement however if no agreement has been reached by 1 may 2012 which is almost three years off will the parties involved be able to come to another agreement so very quickly after that date alternatively will the whole structure be in chaoswith respect to the people who work in departments with responsibility for matters such as tourism and so on i point out that we are dealing with matters that are substantially more difficult and dangerous for the people of northern ireland and given what has happened in years gone by possibly for people in great britain as well having listened to what the minister of state said i am not entirely satisfied that we can leave the bill as it stands and i think that i would prefer a fallback position to be put in placei do not intend to speak at any length to amendment 7 which is a probing amendment to ensure the independence of the psni and the judiciary in northern ireland it addresses the concerns that have existed in northern ireland for a number of years and which have prevented the devolution of policing and justice i would very much welcome the ministers observations on that amendment as well", "our concern is this if there is no model in place what happens then", "let me start by saying that the bill is extremely complicated it may be short and quite technical but it is extremely complicated in that it amends a number of previous acts as hon members have already said and that those acts have been amended previously i thank the clerks and the northern ireland office for being so helpful but at times even they had to do quite a bit of research to explain some of the things proposed by the bill i suggest that in future we try to find a slightly better way of dealing with legislation that amends so many previous acts that have already been amendedmore time was needed for the bill let me reiterate that conservative front benchers took the view that the time would have been better spent on second reading rather than on debating the programme motion that said when the vote came we whipped our hon friends to support the amendment standing in the name of my hon friend the member for wellingborough mr bone we on the front bench greatly regret the fact that this debate has been truncated when there is very little business taking place in the house tomorrow we could have gone over into tomorrow and had a proper debate but now we will have only two hours for the committee stage and there are a number of amendments to discusswe support the concept of devolution over the past four years i have probably sat on more statutory instrument committees than any hon member in this parliament we have decided some very important matters in statutory instrument committee especially before the assembly was reconvened almost two years ago i am clearly on record as saying how wrong it is to decide major issues that affect more than 15 million people in committees upstairs that were as ever stuffed with people who would go along with the party line which was certainly true of government members that was wrong those issues should have been decided by the people of northern ireland and i have clearly stated that on the recordas my hon friend the member for north shropshire mr paterson has said we are very much in favour of devolving policing and justice of course that has to happen when the time is right and it has to be done in the right format in our judgment this model for the devolution of policing and justice is the one with the most merit it could however be improved in a number of ways we are concerned that there is no time limit for the appointment of a minister to oversee these matters when policing and justice are devolved devolution could take place without a minister being in place as the hon member for foyle mark durkan has pointed out after an assembly election all the other ministers have to be appointed within seven days but no time limit is specified for the appointment of this new minister given the rather difficult security situation in northern ireland we consider it unacceptable that responsibility should be devolved without a minister being in place to oversee it we have tabled amendments which i hope that we shall discuss to address that situationwe hear what the secretary of state has said about the supervision of the dpp but we consider it unacceptable for someone in such a serious office not to be required to report to anyone or to obtain the protection of another law officer again we have tabled amendments to try to address that situation in regard to the comments made by the right hon member for belfast east mr robinson about extracting the appointment of judicial positions from politicians we also think that it would be better if the attorneygeneral for northern ireland were appointed by the lord chief justice for northern ireland as that would strengthen devolution we want to return to that matter in committee", "if the right hon gentleman will allow me we want to return to that matter in greater detail in committee we have tabled amendments on the subject and we would like to discuss it at greater length at that time we consider our proposal to be a better optioni have only a short amount of time left but may i just say that our final concern relates to the fallback position what would happen for example if the department were dissolved on 1 may 2012 there should be something in the bill to tell us what would happen in those circumstances again we are trying to ensure that devolution will work we are trying to cement it rather than undermine it i would be grateful if the minister could address some of these points now in case we do not reach them all during the very short committee stage i hope that hon members will forgive me for not referring to all the speeches that were made during our second reading debate i have made notes on them all but i do not have time to go through them some very important points were raised howeveras has been said the bill does not introduce devolution but it might encourage it when the time is right as far as we are concerned that is a matter for the assembly to decide at this stage we wish the bill well but we will attempt to improve it somewhat during the very short committee stage that follows", "the hon gentleman will have observed that our amendments address not only what will happen after an assembly election but what would happen if policing and justice were devolved later this year we feel that in that event a minister should be in place almost immediately or at least as soon as possible", "as has been mentioned there has been an increase in dissident activity that has included a brutal murder the use of pipe bombs and a petrol bomb dissident weapons have also been discovered including sawnoff shotguns and pistols and in particular there have also been attacks on the police i welcome the secretary of states announcement that the police response will be proportionate but what protection can he give to the police like the communities they too are the targets", "to ask the secretary of state for transport what estimate he has made of the amount of salt

"may i congratulate the right hon member for sheffield central mr caborn on securing this most timely and important debate racing is certainly at a crossroads particularly with regard to funding i agree with his points on europe and will return to that issue in a few minutesi should point out that i have the honour of representing the cheltenham race course although i also value the contributions made by smaller race courses my involvement in racing is at the lowest level at the pointtopoint and hunter chase level but i want to point out that the tote is extremely important to the cheltenham race course and the surrounding area in my constituency the festival each march brings millions of pounds into the area much of it from ireland an important point is that the tote cheltenham gold cup\u2014now called the totesport cheltenham gold cup\u2014has been running for many years and is one of the worlds leading steeplechases if not the greatestthe tote also provides a great deal of prize money and sponsorship for many other races not only at cheltenham but throughout the country the totes contribution to racing excluding its levy payments was \u00a3113 million last year if we include the levy payments its contribution was \u00a320 million last year the most uptodate figures are being laid before parliament today i do not know what they are but my guess is that they will show a considerable improvement on what is already a good record for the totes contribution to racingthe tote is the largest commercial sponsor of racing by a considerable margin it sponsored 442 races last year and delivered 42 per cent of the total prize money on offer through the sport while we often hear that racing is the sport of kings it is important to point out that the reality is different although royalty are involved in racing and make a welcome contribution on many occasions the money for a race is as little as \u00a32000 given the cost of looking after horses particularly with the current cost of feeding and transportation prize money is important the tote also provides many other services there are many betting shops services on race courses and special lowcost bets that are attractive the tote is a national institution so if it were lost not only would racing lose out financially but the racegoers would sufferas has been said the tote was set up 80 years ago to benefit racing as has also been pointed out no government have ever put any money into racing so the taxpayer is not due any money from a sale or transfer of the tote when the then home secretary the present secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor originally announced his intention to transfer or sell the tote a figure of \u00a350 million was mentioned some people myself included said that that was too much and that the taxpayer was due no return at all for the tote because no taxpayer ever put any money into itthe original decision to transfer or sell the tote was welcomed but no one could have envisaged that it would take so long to get from there to where we are now wherever that might be during a debate on 21 november 2007 after europe stepped into the debate\u2014i shall return to that point later\u2014i called for the government to allow an extra two or three months at least for the tote to come to terms with the european judgment and look at its future options those two or three months were granted by the government but that is a short delay for coming to terms with the situation it is a rather different situation from the 10year delay that we have experienced", "i was outside this place at the time but i certainly supported turning british steels \u00a315 million a day loss into profit i continue to support that kind of thing but the tote is a different situation altogether it was set up for racing the right hon member for sheffield central made the case that it is not so much a business as part of a sport and i shall advance that argument in a momentas i was saying we have had a 10year delay in a previous debate initiated by mr richard page then the member for southwest hertfordshire i urged that the process be completed the then minister who is now the minister for pensions reform rebuked me by sayingalthough the hon member for tewkesbury thinks that the process has taken a long time it has not taken longer than we planned\u2014official report westminster hall 19 january 2000 vol 342 c 219whthose words were spoken on 19 january 2000 eight and a half years ago we were being rebuked for trying to press the matter on as we have heard the result of the delay is that the staff at wigan whose jobs i believe should be protected are unsettled senior members of the tote have been lost and it is very difficult for the tote to recruit people that has had a destabilising effect on it and can hardly be helping its finances importantly it cannot be helping to enhance its value if it is to be sold commerciallyat the risk of embarrassing the right hon member for sheffield central who has admitted his culpability in the process to a degree i add that when the horserace betting and olympic lottery bill was introduced in 2004 it was extraordinary that its very purpose the sale or transfer of the tote was not mentioned in it the only thing that was included in the bill was the nationalisation of the tote as a number of us pointed out at the time it was stated outside the house that the purpose was to transfer the tote to the new trust which was set up under the chairmanship of lord lipsey but that was not stated in the billthe late robin cook who took an active role in racing said in the debate on the 2004 actfor the avoidance of doubt will my right hon friend\u2014the right hon member for sheffield central who was then the minister\u2014confirm that it is the governments clear intention to sell the tote to the racing trust and that there is no reason at the moment why that should not happenthe right hon gentleman repliedi can give my right hon friend that confirmation i see no reason why the sale of the tote to the racing trust should not go aheadrather ominously he continuedbut it would be wrong if the government did not make provision for other eventualitiesthat concerned me deeply and i said thatthe bill does not guarantee that the tote will be sold to the racing trust the minister says that he cannot foresee any circumstances in which that would not happen but one factor that might prevent such a sale would be if the government asked for too much money\u2014official report 8 january 2004 vol 416 c44243later in the debate i askedwhat guarantee do we have that it will not just be sold to the highest bidder what guarantee do we have that the governments finances at that time which are deteriorating will not dictate that the tote is sold to the highest bidder\u2014official report 8 january 2004 vol 416 c482i claim no particular insider foresight because i got it spot on but the tote is now to be sold to the highest bidder which concerns me for a number of reasons", "i agree with the right hon gentleman and i shall return to europe in a moment but i am aware that time is pressing oni am concerned about the openmarket sale first because that was not what we agreed to when we passed the 2004 act secondly as i asked the right hon gentleman in an intervention if there is a openmarket sale how can we ensure that racing continues to get the same amount of money from the tote after the process is finishedwe have heard a great deal about the 5050 split with 50 per cent going back into racing but that poses questions first what is racing secondly would it get through europe the right hon gentleman says that it should\u2014not that it would\u2014but the previous proposal should have too important though the money from the sale would be it would be much less than if the sale had taken place last year because of the market conditions also it would be a oneoff payment the important thing is the totes yearonyear contribution to racing if i highlight any point that i am making it is thatwe find ourselves in a difficult situation we all know that europe intervened as we have discussed and it is my submission that the european judgment was wrong that is the view of the allparty group on the racing and bloodstock industries which is very active for example the eu referred to the tote as a public company but it is a public company only because the government nationalised it it stated that a transfer below market value would constitute aid but who exactly would it aid the company is already up and running and has been for 80 years the proposal was not to transfer the tote to another company which probably would have constituted state aid but a simple administrative change whereby the tote could for example have appointed its own chairman that is not state aidthe eu went on to state that such a transfer or sale would distort the betting market i am not sure how many bureaucrats in europe actually go into betting shops or place bets but that is simply nonsense the organisation has been taking bets for 80 years if the tote instead of the minister appointed its chairman how would that distort the betting market it is palpable nonsense so the government should challenge that rulingi am romantic in that i want the tote to be transferred to the racing trust and believe that that can be achieved i do not agree entirely with the right hon gentlemans analysis of how it should be done but i agree in principle that that should be achieved we are at a crossroads in the financing of racing and it would be a huge boost to racing if it could run a successful business that continued to put money back into racing however i fear that the minister whom i greatly admire and consider a friend is not quite powerful enough to overcome the treasurys demands i do not know whether racing or the treasury will benefit from those demandsa couple of fridays ago we had about 145 people at a charity dinner in the house for the injured jockeys fund in one night we raised more than \u00a350000 it was a fantastic night and brought together the warring factions of racing for once there is an appetite for moving forward together and i hope that the treasury does not prevent us from doing that", "the shops are the more profitable part of the tote if they are sold to someone not connected with racing how can we guarantee an ongoing income from them the money from the government will be a oneoff the tote cannot live off that the right hon gentleman may suggest that a further tote business could be set up but i cannot see that idea getting past europe", "just a few moments ago i had a meeting with some young people from a

have a serious discussion with the secretary of state about the points i have made that is all i expect of him tonight", "i am pleased to have secured this debate i am very grateful to the minister for staying behind to reply particularly as we did not know what time it would be when we got to this stagethe subject of this debate\u2014the implications for tewkesbury of the south west regional spatial strategy\u2014is especially important not only do we have green belt green fields and beautiful areas in my constituency that we wish to protect but as the world knows we have a problem with flooding i say as the world knows because it is true on recent trips to three countries in the far east and four countries in the caribbean my constituency of tewkesbury was known about for the wrong reason\u2014the terrible floods of july 2007 it is worth remembering that as a result of those floods three people lost their lives and thousands had their homes and businesses flooded hundreds of thousands lost mains water supplies\u2014some for up to three weeks\u2014and power supplies were affected the effects of the july 2007 floods remain with us even now almost 10 months on approximately 385 households in my constituency are still displaced from their homes and some are probably still months from returning to them business in certain parts of my constituency remains depressedi have held two adjournment debates on flooding and on each occasion\u2014and on many other occasions\u2014i have said the following people in my constituency accept that living at the confluence of two rivers means that the area will flood every so often fields in the area flood a number of times each year although we all accept that the rainfall of 20 july 2007 was exceptional we believe that certain factors made the flooding worse than it needed to be one factor was the poor maintenance of the culverts sewers drains ditches and waterways but the other factor was that too many houses have been built in flood risk areas people accept that the area will flood but the one overriding message that people give to me which they want me to pass on to the minister is that we should not be making the situation any worse than it needs to be we should mitigate rather than escalate the problem imagine then the disappointment and anger at the contents of the regional spatial strategy which proposes the building of thousands of houses in my constituency in areas that have to be classed as at risk of floodingbefore i go any further let me state what should be the obvious this is not just a matter of whether the new houses flood houses built in the wrong place take up field space that would otherwise have soaked up water thereby preventing that water from resting on those fields water will be sent into other areas causing terrible flooding in other words the runoff of water from one development causes other developments to flood that fact should be obvious but certain people just focus on whether the new houses flood that is missing the point either deliberately or otherwise those people also state that houses built in those areas should be floodresilient again that is missing the point because the presence of these houses causes other houses to flood it is my submission therefore that to build thousands of houses in or around my constituency would be madness what further evidence other than three deaths people still being out of their homes and business still being flat 10 months on do those taking the decisions need to persuade them to build houses elsewherein the rss the required number of houses for the whole housing market area is about 56400 with 23 per cent of these\u2014a total of 13100\u2014proposed for the tewkesbury district if we want to talk about constituency boundaries 277 per cent\u201415600 houses\u2014would be within my constituency much of which is a flood risk area if we analyse those figures we see that the rss proposes the building of many houses at longford and innsworth close to the walham power station which as everyone knows almost went under during the 2007 floods if the water had risen much higher at that power station hundreds of thousands of people would have lost their mains power supply and that was almost the case if that area is not at risk of flooding what is how can it make sense to propose to build houses in such an areahouses also flooded in bishops cleeve but the rss proposes the building of thousands of houses close to that village uckington floods and flood alleviation schemes are being built to contain the river chelt in that area yet again thousands of houses are being proposed for that area and 2900 houses are proposed for the rest of the tewkesbury district from conversations that i have held with planners it appears that those houses might have to be built close to tewkesbury town which was badly affected only last year and remains so no one can forget the television images of the town surrounded by waterthe evidence of the problems of excessive building is already there for all to see for example in bredon road in tewkesbury houses in the process of being built flooded and houses that were built in noverton lane worsened the flooding in the village of prestbury where in june\u2014never mind july\u2014houses flooded for the first time in peoples 40year memories they flooded again in july of course and the streets became like rivers who can say that those extra houses did not worsen mattersthe government often say that they have strengthened the case against building in flood risk areas through planning policy statement 25 however a glance at that document which was published in december 2006\u2014months before the terrible floods in 2007\u2014shows that the guidance on building outside flood risk areas is qualified by wider sustainability objectives the exceptional test allows building in flood risk areasso what is the principle that underpins pps25 is it avoiding inappropriate development in flood risk areas or ensuring that housing targets are met in other words the exceptional test undermines the principle of the whole document and disregards the dangers and major disruptions experienced by people who live in flood risk areasas sir michael pitt says in his interim reportsome respondents felt that the introduction of this test could be interpreted as a getout clause for local authorities\u2014or in this case the rss crucially he continuesa decision to permit development should not be taken lightly by the planning authority not least because a prospective purchaser will generally assume that the granting of planning permission signals that the local authority does not perceive there to be a problem with flood riskthat is a good point who will buy those houses if they are perceived to be likely to flood and if there are problems with insuring them earlier today the association of british insurers told mewe want to ensure that wherever possible new homes are not built in high flood risk areas if they are then insurers cannot guarantee to offer coverplanning policy statement 25 calls for flood risk assessments to be made at all levels of the planning process however what flood risk assessments were made during the compilation of the rss a document that was largely drawn up before the floods of july 2007 does not that in itself make it incumbent on the secretary of state to require the authors to go back to the drawing board on their housing proposalswhat constitutes a flood risk area if the definition is based on annual likelihood of flooding how can that be assessed if we accept that climate change is taking place in other words a place with a one in a 100 chance of flooding in the past can no longer be assumed to be in that category if the climate is changing as the government tell us it iswe are of course supposed to be protected from inappropriate development by the environment agency however an appeal to build 600 houses near longford in my constituency close to walham substation is currently being considered by the secretary of state i have submitted photographs of at least part of that site when flooded yet the environment agency did not even submit an objection to the application even worse the environment agency said that the area did not have a monitoring station on the site but it does that station indicated flooding so i hope that the secretary of state will take that error into account when assessing the appeali suggest that the fact that the environment agency has not objected to the proposed building at longford is evidence that as currently constituted it is simply not up to the job and its role should be reviewed how can the environment agency when it has seen the effects of the flooding in my area fail to object to the proposals to build thousands more houses there it defies belief of course some might describe my objection to those houses as an example of nimbyism\u2014but if it is so be it i am paid to represent the people of my constituency and i do not believe it to be in their best interests to have those houseslet us consider the situation somewhat more widely village post offices are closing including a further six in my constituency pubs are closing at the rate of an estimated 27 a week and village shops are struggling so why not top up the housing stock in villages throughout the country many villages are calling for such development partly so that their own people can continue to live in the villages where they were bornwhy is the concentration on principal urban areas why are so many houses needed in the first place what is the science used to calculate the need for such housing stock it cannot be that the divorce rate and the life expectancy figures are still accelerating to such a degree however i accept that the net immigration figures are a worry with a total of 162 million more people coming to this country than leaving it over the past 10 years which puts pressure on housing that perhaps needs tackling as a separate problem the method of calculation immigration the dispersal of houses and the planning process are all underlying issues that the government should tackle rather than allowing unelected regional bureaucrats to make crude calculations about the number of houses that we are supposed to need in each constituencythe government have made two promises that are relevant to this debate one which they made before being elected to office was to end the predictandprovide approach to housing that has not happened in fact that approach has been entrenched and on a regional basis which is why we are in the current predicament the second promise made after last weeks election results was that the prime minister would listen to peoples concernsthe prime minister paid a welcome visit to my constituency during the flooding i now call on him the secretary of state and the minister to listen to what the people of tewkesbury are saying that building extra housing to the level proposed by the rss would make the risk of flooding in the area significantly worse with the risk to life property business and possessions being greatly heightenedwhen he visited tewkesbury the prime minister saw for himself the water the bowsers the problems at walham and the mythe and the enormous efforts that people were making to help each other i know that he would not want us to go through that again so through his secretary of state and the minister who is here tonight the prime minister needs to reject the proposals in the rss to which i have referred in order to reduce that likelihood to refuse to do so will be to fail to respond to the situation in which we found ourselves last year and will also represent a failure to listen as only the changes that the minister makes to the rss will be open to further public consultation this is our last chance to affect the outcome of

testify is not a secure position that is why the finns decided to build a third nuclear reactor as i said in an intervention contrary to what we have heard in the chamber this afternoon they also have a repository to deal with the intermediatelevel waste i have been underground inside it which is proof that it exists at the time the finns were also starting to build a repository for highlevel waste it can be dealt with the fact that it has not been dealt with in the united kingdom is not due to any geological problems or to the fact that it cannot be done it is due to a lack of political will we should not confuse that with the issue itselfif we do not build a new nuclear base and if we increase renewables up to 20 per cent by 2020 and we lose our entire nuclear industry we will have made no progress at all on carbon it is unbelievable that hon members are shaking their heads i am not sure about their maths but my calculation is that if nuclear provides about 18 per cent of the united kingdoms electricity now and if we lose that and go up to 18 or 20 per cent from renewables roughly the same amount of carbon would be emitted so we would have gone nowherei am not pretending that there are not issues in the nuclear industry and my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alan duncan spoke about finance", "i am a firm believer in renewables if we have renewables and a nuclear industry we will be going places with regard to carbon on a very cold very still day we would get no electricity at all from wind power let us not forget that on the coldest days in the united kingdom which are very still there would be no wind and therefore no electricity so we should not depend on that source to a greater extenton the financing of the industry my hon friend the member for rutland and melton is right however if it is not attractive for companies to bid to build nuclear power plants they will not do it so i do not see that there is a great fuss to be made about that aspect the government have invited bids which they could have done 10 years ago but they have not said that there will be a new generation of nuclear power plants they can improve and speed up the planning process and perhaps encourage the processes to go ahead in areas that already have nuclear power plants such as sizewell and sellafield that would be sensible i am glad that the government have said what they have although they have not actually said we are going to build a new generation of nuclear power plantsthe hon member for northavon steve webb who spoke for the liberal democrats is no longer in his place and i do not wish to be unkind but in what i considered a rather politically naive speech he made a good point when he asked what would happen if no one came forward to bid the same would be true if no one came forward to bid for the severn barrage as an mp whose constituency is bordered by the river severn i have looked into the matter closely i have also visited the barrage at la rance in brittany which was built 40 years ago it is probably a tenth of the size of the potential of the severn barrage but it was well worth visiting to see how it works\u2014and it does work when it was built there was tremendous disruption to fish life and to bird life and it has taken quite a long time for that to recover i was told by people there when i visited that if they built it now with new technology they might do it differently and it might not cause the same disruptionthe appraisal which is at least 10 years late is welcome i want to ensure that it takes an independent look at the prospects of a severn barrage with all that that means it is probably fairly easy to calculate the amount of electricity that would be generated from it that has to be good\u2014it is secure and it is green i want the wider aspects of the environment to be considered when the appraisal goes aheadmy constituency was badly hit six months ago by the terrible floods as were a number of other places the past couple of weeks have been extremely worrying for people there who are not even back in their homes after six months and are some months from being so they are extremely anxious about further flooding the appraisal must also consider what impact a severn barrage would have on flooding in the area i do not have the technical knowledge to say whether it would be good or bad for flooding i want the appraisal to take an independent look at thati have some enthusiasm for the project which deserves very serious consideration for the reasons that i have given we have to find a way forward in respect of secure and green energy supplies however i hope that the appraisal will be objective and neutral i am a little concerned that the people running it are by and large linked to or from the government i understand that they will take evidence from outsiders but i would have liked the running of the appraisal to have been better and more balanced nevertheless we are where we are and i hope that those involved will take into account the points that i have raisedit is important that we move forward with projects such as the severn barrage because of the importance of security of supply and green issues however we also have to move forward with the balanced energy policy that i mentioned at the beginning unlike the hon member for northavon i do not accept that nuclear energy would take our eye off the ball only a smallminded person would allow that to happen we must have nuclear and renewables and we will have to continue with coal and gas for some time yet having one source of electricity does not mean that we cannot have another one we must have a balanced approach to energy putting all our eggs in one basket would be dangerous and i hope that we do not go down that road", "the hon member for morley and rothwell colin challen mentioned finland and said that the waste had not been dealt with but about four years ago i went to finland and stood in the repository intermediatelevel waste had certainly been dealt with i stood underground next to it at the time a highlevel waste underground repository was being built we should not confuse the lack of possibility with the lack of political will", "it is important that the minister answers the point raised by my hon friend the member for christchurch mr chope will we be able to comment on the entire report during the consultation or only the changes proposed to it", "i shall be brief as at least two more hon members wish to speak i hope that i can secure a separate debate to discuss the impact on gloucestershire of the regional spatial strategy because i have many detailed points that are not appropriate now that i should like to make in another debate while the minister considers the reporti congratulate my hon friend the member for christchurch mr chope on securing a debate on this important subject he tackled the issue as i would have hoped to myself covering the nonsense of the governments policy of being elected on the ending of the predict and provide approach to housing we all applauded that at the time because it was a necessary policy i am sorry that it has been ditched he could have gone on to say that when the regional government concept was rejected in the northeast it would have been sensible to reject it throughout the country instead we have regional government by stealth and there is no worse example than this issue to show what an inappropriate way that is of carrying on government when things are done regionally there is no feel for the position locally so inappropriate recommendations are inevitably made\u2014no more so than in gloucestershirei take us back to last july my hon friend said that he would not discuss flooding but with your permission mr olner i shall my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar mr pickles was kind enough to visit tewkesbury at that time when he saw some of the devastation that the floods caused indeed the prime minister the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs and several other ministers from defra and the department for communities and local government have been kind and generous with their time in the past six months they have visited the area several times and are giving some money we could do with a lot more but does not everyone say thatall that time energy and interest will be wasted if we ignore the central problem in my area which includes not only tewkesbury but a wider part of gloucestershire we understand that we live in a flood risk area\u2014two rivers converge at tewkesbury so there are bound to be problems\u2014but there are still hundreds of people living in caravans in my constituency it is six months since the main event and those people are months away from being settled back into their homes the question that bothers them more than anything else is whether lessons will be learned from the flooding the defra inquiry is going on and sir michael pitt is carrying out an inquiry\u2014i am meeting him tomorrow morning\u2014and the main thing that my constituents would want me to say is for goodness sake we know that we live in a flood risk area but lets not make things worse than they need to beit will rain heavily again in the future indeed the rain has been quite heavy in the past few weeks people in other areas of the country have probably suffered a little more than we have this time we know that it will rain again and that the water table is high in my area we also know that the building of thousands of houses in the past few years has made the matter worse but the rss which was unbelievably submitted to the minister at a time when we were frightened that flooding would recur in gloucestershire proposes thousands more houses in my constituency some of which will be on fields that have flooded the rss is not sitespecific but those of us with local knowledge can guess where the houses are going to go some will be close to areas that flood and some will take up green fields that would otherwise soak up water preventing it from going elsewhere and causing flooding it is important that the people who frame such documents understand that if houses are built on fields that previously soaked up flood water there is a question not only of whether those houses will be flooded although that is obviously important but whether they will cause other houses in the area to flood that concept seems to pass conveniently by people who want to find places to put thousands of housesi have a home as does everyone present i expect everyone is entitled to a home but do we really want to build houses and homes for which the owners are unlikely to get insurance certainly against flooding or are likely to have large excesses on their insurance policies if they do get them it is not unusual nowadays to have a \u00a320000 excess which effectively means that those people are not insured against flooding should houses be in areas where they might flood or cause other homes to flood or should we take a more sensible approach as my hon friend the member for christchurch suggested in his opening remarksfinally the report starts by stating that its central guiding feature is sustainability i am not quite sure what that word means and i am not sure that the reports authors know what it means i should like them to give an example of what is not sustainable is a house flooding sustainable is failing to get insurance sustainable is a lack of infrastructure sustainable the report talks about ashchurch railway station which has twice recently had train services cut it talks about the possible parkway station and says that it should be built between cheltenham and gloucester but the government recently turned down funding for it however i do not think that they were wrong to do that at this point as there needs to be an awful lot more thought on it we do not have the necessary infrastructure or land that is safe from flooding so will the minister give us her idea of what is sustainable the proposals in the rss to build in large parts of gloucestershire certainly would not be sustainable on any understanding that i have of the word", "chapter 4323 of the panel reports states thatthe panel does not therefore accept the argument advanced by gloucestershire county council

draft regional spatial strategy to the government suggesting that thousands of extra houses should be built in my constituency people need houses but do they want them where they cannot get insurance where they will flood or where they will cause other peoples property to flood the regional spatial strategy document needs to be thrown straight back at the assembly and rejected outright", "to ask

me mr speaker and i thank the minister for remaining behind to reply to it i know that he has been extremely active on the issue of flooding i am also glad to see other hon members here including my hon friend the member for forest of dean mr harpera number of people have asked me if you held a debate on this issue in october why are you holding another one today the reason is quite simple to keep the issue on the agenda two inquiries are under way one by the department for environment food and rural affairs and one by the government however it is important to keep reminding people that there are many in tewkesbury\u2014i shall talk about tewkesbury but i know that other areas have been affected too\u2014who continue to suffer from the effects of the flooding which happened some months ago although the emergency passed long ago the problems remainone of the biggest remaining problems is the fact that many people\u2014567 according to an estimate by tewkesbury borough council\u2014are still displaced from their homes many are living in caravans and throughout christmas many had to live in cold cramped conditions on the drives of their homes some have been able to use the upper floors of their houses but it has been a very uncomfortable time for them while the rest of us may have enjoyed some comforts over christmas they have been sufferingmany people whose homes were devastated are back in them now it seems to depend on the speed at which loss adjusters and builders have worked i do not mean to suggest that some builders have been working slowly but families who know live near or are related to builders have tended to get the work done much more quickly than those who made arrangements through insurance companies i make no criticism of the companies concerned\u2014it is just a very slow system\u2014but when they have allocated builders the process has taken some time it has been a very uncomfortable period for many of my constituents and it may be months before those displaced from their homes can return to themi pay tribute to those people i visited as many as i could before christmas and their spirit was incredible virtually all those who were living in caravans and would be in them over christmas took the time to wish me a happy christmas although their own season had been so disrupted old people young people people who were ill people who were healthy children\u2014a very mixed bag\u2014were concerned enough to wish me a happy christmas that says something about the people of tewkesbury", "my hon friend is right the main thing that most of my constituents want is for lessons to be learnt they accept that we live on a floodplain and that we often see water on the fields but they do not accept that things need be quite as bad as they were we must learn those lessonsas people work towards returning to their homes their great fear is that the floods could come again in his report to which i shall return in a moment sir michael pitt described the fear that existed at the time of the floods now there is a different fear what if it happens again i do not think we can assume that this was a onein150years flood we do not know whether it was or not heaven forbid it could happen again next week or next year in the house we often discuss the problems caused by climate change but i think we should take account of the fact that the same amount of rain could fall again at any time we hope that it will not but we really do not knowpeople are living in fear and although i have tried to establish contact with as many of them as possible\u2014i have placed advertisements in newspapers and written to people\u2014it is difficult to reach everyone despite all the activity going on around them people feel alone one thing that worries them is insurance for the future many face increased premiums some cannot obtain insurance cover at all and some are being told by insurance companies if you want flood cover there will be a very large excess on your policy one lady told me\u2014and i think this is fairly typical\u2014that the insurance company had said there would be a \u00a310000 excess on her buildings insurance and a further \u00a310000 excess on insurance for furniture and other items effectively that person has no insurance if it floods again it will cost her at least \u00a320000 out of her own pocket we may be in a position perhaps to criticise people who were not insured last time but what about now people cannot get insurance the association of british insurers saidwe continue to decline a request for new cover for a property which has recently flooded unless the property has already been reinstated and where we are supplied with details of the flooding what caused the flood what the cost of the damage was and\u2014crucially\u2014what action has been taken to avoid any future eventsurely that is beyond the control of the householder it is not the ministers fault either but i would like to ask him if he has any idea of what can be done in this respectanother problem is that business is down particularly in the town of tewkesbury it has been a bit depressed for a while\u2014more than it ought to be\u2014but businesses are struggling to come to terms with what has happened there was a tremendous loss of trade at the time but it has not picked up as we hoped it would i would welcome any suggestions that the minister may have but i want to say publicly that tewkesbury is open for business it is working and still open as i have said it did not end up like new orleans sadly ended up i hope that people will continue to come to tewkesburyone of the problems is identifying who is responsible for which ditch which drain and which culvert is it the environment agency the highways agency british waterways the county council the borough councils or the riparian owner it is very difficult once an organisation accepts responsibility it then must put the job right which of course costs moneyi wrote to the minister on 15 november specifying projects that needed completion i shall return to those in a moment but on the issues of drains ditches sewers and culverts we have had heavy rain in some parts of the country which has brought the problems to light i wonder what state the ditches and drains are in throughout the country we simply do not know i am pleased that sir michael pitts report has highlighted that as an important issuewe have a problem at prestbury where houses where people have lived without flooding for 40 years flooded in june the culverts were not joined up and a tree fell on another culvert the tree was listed and the owner did not want it to be felled so the problems go on the problem now is that some months on the environment agency is saying that it wants the whole cost to be reassessed there will be a further delay in fixing the culverts in an area where 500 homes remain at riskthere is a problem with the bridge at bredon road which was cut off during the floods causing the town of tewkesbury to be isolated the bridge has been repaired but at low cost i do not think that it would withstand future flooding planning permission has been sought for a further 105 homes further up the road close to the bridge those houses would connect to the main sewers which might not have the capacity to cope what are the planning requirements with regard to drains who is responsible for the ongoing maintenance again sir michael pitts report asks those questionsin uckington gardens collapsed into the river chelt and one person at least is still awaiting answers from the environment agency about what can be done to rectify matters", "the hon gentleman is right and i would go further as i have before on a number of issues the environment agency as it is formulated is not up to the job it either needs more responsibilities and powers and perhaps more money or it deserves to be scrapped i really do not think that it serves a useful purpose as it stands i again appeal to the minister that something be done about itwe have also had a problem with maps the flood risk maps did not correspond to the floods we actually had\u2014and sir michael pitt referred to the fact that flood risk maps for surface water did not exist at all this raises a question if the maps do not correspond to the actual flooding we are having should they be used to determine where houses can be built i want to return to that although i realise that i do not have as much time in this debate as i had last year so i shall have to hurry up a biti want services to be protected it is good that mythe water treatment works and walham substation are now protected by hesco bastions but they are semipermanent and permanent measures are definitely needed alternative networked supplies are also neededon money if tewkesbury borough council wanted for example to spend a little more on flood relief would it be allowed to go over the capping limit i do not know the answer to that and i wonder whether the minister might be able to help i am pleased that the government have secured about \u00a3100 million from the solidarity fund but i would like to know how that money will be distributed and usedturning to sir michael pitts interim report i am meeting him on 23 january and i will raise some of the following issues with him but it will be useful to run through them briefly now the report raises a number of good points particularly with regard to drains ditches sewers surface water and agencies responsibilities for example he says thatthe automatic right to connect surface water drainage of new developments to the sewerage system should be removedthat is a useful suggestionsir michael acknowledges however that it is an interim report he says that more information is needed and in a bid to help in that process i wish to make a couple of comments some of the interim suggestions are a little general there is a lot of talk about strategies assessments and guidances and i hope that they can be worked up into more direct proposals for action i also think that there is too much emphasis on homeowners doing work to protect against floods which has caused a little offence in tewkesbury sir michael suggests that instead of being set against the floor plugs should be mounted higher up on walls that is fine but one cannot move cookers right to the ceiling there are obviously certain limitations on what can be donethe department for environment food and rural affairs suggests that it would cost between \u00a33000 and \u00a310000 to protect each home people do not have that sort of money to spend on that point i understand that the environment agency has just taken away the \u00a320000 donation it makes to the national flood forum which is unfortunate that group is a charity it advises people on flooding\u2014and it suggests steps that sir michaels report also suggeststhere has been a little too much emphasis on what individuals can do that is not the main point there is not enough emphasis at present on what the governments role should be in preventing house building on or near floodplains sir michael saysno new building should be allowed in flood risk areas that is not flood resilientto say that such houses must be resilient rather misses the point there used to be green fields that soaked up water if they are built on that water goes elsewhere and causes a problem sir michael was quoted\u2014i do not know how accurately\u2014in the  gloucestershire echo as saying that there is no point in recommending no building in these areas as the government would not listen that weakens the recommendation that is far too weak and it does not appear to be too impartial or too independent the point about where houses are built is the one that people make most frequently people strongly feel that we should not have more houses on floodplains or even in areas close to floodplainsto summarise my recommendations are clear and they are the same as those i made a few months ago there should be no building on or near floodplains we need to clear out the ditches and the drains we need to repair sewers and culverts we need to create one body that is powerful and that is responsible for all this work and for flood prevention and defences we need to identify vulnerable people and buildings and to create a list of them so that they can be helped first should such a situation arise again we need to protect the water and electricity works and to network the supplies and we of course need to improve the defences as far as possibleas i said sir michaels report is an interim one and i hope that we can move it on to become an even stronger report i hope too that the government will take account of the recommendations in it and of the recommendations that those of us who have to live in these areas\u2014who have the pleasure of living in these areas but who have suffered recently\u2014will make", "to ask the secretary of state for business enterprise and regulatory reform what his policy is on underwriting the sakhalin ii oil and gas development when he

davies says but the money for the pitches never went to the race courses in the first place it went up and down families or they bought from friends or associates the national joint pitch council is more responsible than the race courses is it not", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for east devon mr swire on securing this debate i have initiated a number of debates on horse racing and i know that there is tremendous interest in the sport and thus in the debates i therefore congratulate my hon friend on securing a 90minute debate which allows a few more hon members to make a contributionmy hon friend mentioned that holding the debate today is appropriate but also slightly difficult given that the funeral of sir tristram ricketts is taking place this afternoon i pay a brief but personal tribute to sir tristram who was well known throughout the sport he always had time for everyone he always had a smile a joke a word of wisdom for people he will be sadly missed not only by the sport but by his many friends i hope to set off for the funeral immediately after the debate i suspect that i will have to stand outside as so many people will be there nevertheless it is important to be there in that respect it is a sad daymy hon friend was right to say how important horse racing is to the country and to rural communities he was right also to say that it is a magnificent spectacle there can be no doubt that it is the envy of the world it is my great privilege to represent what i consider to be the greatest race course in the world cheltenham race course at prestbury park falls within my tewkesbury constituency of course racing is equally important to those who represent tracks such as those at hereford and worcester\u2014and mr atkinson the smaller tracks such as hexham\u2014as that is where horses start their racing careers they do not start at cheltenham although those that are lucky may end up therea great process has to be gone through in order to reach the top all race courses are important whatever happens and whatever decisions are taken i hope that we retain 59 race courses\u2014and possibly one or two more", "and aintree of course", "i agree with a lot of things that the right hon gentleman says but i cannot quite agree with that comment however i may return to the point later it says something about me that i know members more by the race course that they represent than by their constituencyracing is a fantastic sport and it is the envy of the world much of it is right and going in the right direction the quality of the racing at cheltenham this weekend was tremendous however there are problems to highlight those problems is not an attempt to run the sport down it is a refusal to be complacent about the future of the sport which is probably what motivated my hon friend to hold this debate it certainly motivated me to speak today my comments are meant not to be negative but to act as something of a wakeup call to the industrys problemsone problem was mentioned by my hon friend there are so many different parts to racing\u2014the horses the owners the jockeys the trainers the stable staff the race courses the bookies and the bodies that control racing in a sense that is its weakness because all those elements are indispensable if one removed jockeys there would obviously be no racing and if one removed trainers there would be no racing either each element is extremely important yet the industry seems unable to come together and progress in the right directionthere are a number of current disputes one of which relates to the emergence of turf tv i do not say that turf tv is a bad thing in itself but the emergence of a second provider of pictures to betting shops is causing difficulties and a dispute on that is the last thing that racing needs i do not want duplication of costs because it will have a knockon effect my hon friend the member for east devon was absolutely right to say that technically and legally the dispute is nothing to do with the levy but in the real world money has to be considered and the fact is that there is only one pot so something will have to give if only half of race courses are featured in bookies in future less money will be bet on racing in those shops which means that less money will pass through the levy system that brings us back to the same point less money for race courses and difficulties for themwe need to look at things in the round we cannot say that the levy is irrelevant even if that is legally and technically correct when bookmakers come to the minister and tell him that they want to pay \u00a335 million instead of \u00a390 million he will have to take everything into account i hope that he will not reduce the levy payments because that would have a negative effect on race courses but the trend for the levy is downwardi am emphatically not asking the minister to scrap the levy i am saying to racing that it should look beyond the levy because the levy has had its day we have to reach commercial agreements and find commercially realistic ways of funding racing", "the hon lady is right the minister will have to decide this years levy and i hope that he will do so shortly and without there being too much acrimony over the decision i am not saying that the levy should be scrapped next year or even the year after that i am not saying anything at all to the minister on that point my comments are directed instead at the racing industry because it must not be complacent and assume that the levy will remain for ever or that it will always remain at its present level as i have said the recent trend has been downward so industry representatives should not come to us saying the levy is not enough long live the levy because that argument will not be sustainable for too much longeri know that lord donoughue produced an important and impressive report whose interim conclusion was that there might be difficulties in finding commercial solutions and appropriate further arrangements nevertheless those solutions must be found i am not aware that football cricket tennis or any other sport in this country is financed by a tax which is what the levy is nor am i aware that the minister has power to intervene in football transfers or in wimbledon prize money that is not his role and nor is it the role of any member of the government i want racing to change so that it grows in confidence and can create more income of its own and there are ways in which it can do thatone of the problems has been the european union\u2014that wonderful organisation that does british business so much good", "indeed the eu stepped in and stopped the sale of pictures and data en bloc but the same eu laws exist for other sports so i do not think that racing can say there you are europe would not let us do it we must look beyond that and one possibility is singular selling which replaces sale as a whole with individual saleswe have all been at race courses in the rain and found ourselves unable to get a decent cup of tea or a decent meal in proper facilities that is not true of all race courses it is not true of cheltenham for instance but it happens at an awful lot of other race courses and they could gain much more income if they marketed themselves better and provided better facilities i have heard the complaint that some young people will not go to a certain race course on a wet monday afternoon why should they they will go to race courses where there are proper facilities and providing such facilities would give other race courses the opportunity to raise more money themselves", "my hon friend makes a good point we have all been at race courses where the racing has been held up because a second ambulance was not available i am not saying that a second ambulance is unnecessary but that is a small example of the health and safety difficulties the extent of other regulations is a difficulty too as are addon costs nevertheless some race courses could do more for themselves and i think that they will have towhile the levy has been in place there has always been an excuse not to look beyond it and to avoid selfhelp i agree that the levy should be continued for the foreseeable future but the industry should try to generate more income for itself and possibly become less reliant on the bookmakers the share of bookmakers takings in betting offices is falling i think that it is now about 50 per cent but for greyhound racing it probably used to be 100 per cent when betting shops were first licensed the levy removes the incentive on bookmakers to promote racing because they pay a levy on racing whereas they do not pay any levy on football bets i say to the minister that he should carry on with the levy but consider how racing can look beyond the levy and help itself in 1998 i introduced a tenminute bill to try to deregulate race courses so that they could do more on nonrace days and that idea should be revisited because race courses constitute a huge asset that is rarely used outside of racing daysi turn to the situation on the tote i make no criticism of the current minister who was not in his job at the time of the recent legislation his predecessor the right hon member for sheffield central mr caborn has unfortunately left his seat but i make no criticism of him either when the gambling bill was being passed an unusual aspect of it was that it did not include any stated purpose on the tote one purpose of the bill was to transfer the tote to a racing trust and a shadow trust was set up which was chaired by lord lipsey so the intention to transfer existed amazingly however that purpose was not stated in the bill notwithstanding that the bill mentioned nationalisation because the government did not own the tote so before they could transfer it they had to deal with the ownership position however the bill did not deal with transfer to the trust a number of us pointed out at the time that that was potentially difficult and that has proved correctmy hon friend the member for east devon is right that the figure for the transfer discussed at the time was \u00a350 million i argued that that was too much because the government did not own the tote and no government had put any money into it the taxpayer was not owed anything so i did not see why the government should take any money out of the tote\u2014or rather not out of the tote but out of racing as there was nowhere else for it to come from we now find that the transfer figure is something like \u00a3400 million if \u00a350 million was unjust \u00a3400 million is obscene my speech is not party political but the government need to provide some answers on thatat the time of the bills passage our friends in europe got involved yet again the same old european union said no you cannot transfer it for that amount of money\u2014whatever figure applied at the time\u2014because that would be state aid i really cannot see why that should be the case how many civil servants did the government employ did none of them see that coming when the 2005 act was being drafted i shall be kind and not blame the government but i think that parliament has failed the totei believe also however that the increasing strength of the treasury over the last 10 years has played its part in this yes we can blame europe\u2014if there is an opportunity to blame europe i shall be there\u2014but the man who was chancellor for 10 years was so strong and powerful that he became prime minister as we all know and now \u00a3400 million is being quoted no government would willingly throw that away", "yes i hope that the minister will confirm that however i am still concerned about the \u00a3400 million although the hon gentleman makes a very good point my speech is more concerned with what will happen to the tote however he is right and makes a very important pointas i understand it the consortium being put together is not coming up with the money that the government\u2014either because the treasury needs it or because the european union would object if it was any less\u2014require if that is the case will the minister give the tote time for reflection i am well aware that it has been years since the then home secretary now secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor came to the tote annual general meeting and pledged that it would be handed over to the racing trust i am not asking the minister to delay it for a few more years\u2014far from it however if we have gone so long and so far down the road can the tote not be given perhaps just two or three months in which to reflect on the situation and perhaps consider other options i say that for this reason the tote was set up in 1927 in order to benefit racing i fear that if it is put on sale on the open market it might cease to exist that is unthinkable would the cheltenham gold cup still exist would the totes financial contribution to racing still exist that goes for many other things toowe have talked about the financing of racing and we recognise the pressures the last thing that we need is for the amount that the tote puts into racing to disappear simply because parliament has botched the sale if an agreement cannot be reached during the current negotiations will the minister please allow a period of reflection so that we can look at what is going on have discussions and decide on the way forward given that it has taken years to get to this point i do not think that another three months or so is asking too muchthe hon member for livingston mr devine talked at length about the pitch dispute i do not want to get into that too much other than to say that racing does not need yet another dispute and i hope that it can be resolved however i must say that it cannot be a case of dead mans shoes\u2014we must move on from that i have every sympathy for the bookmakers who felt that they had bought the right to a pitch but legally i do not think that they had we must move forward commercially i hope however that that can be done sensitively and with some recognition that people felt that they had bought a right to a living however the jobs for life the dead mans shoes and the seniority that existed in the past are from a bygone age and we must move oni thank you for your time mr atkinson i apologise for having gone on for perhaps a little too long but i think that there are some very important points to be discussed however i shall finish by echoing the words of my hon friend the member for east devon racing is a fantastic sport and an absolutely wonderful spectacle and long may it continue to be so", "what estimate he has made of the average time taken for a medical reexamination in connection with a disability living allowance application to be carried out in the most recent period for which figures are available", "i am sure that the minister will appreciate that in some cases the process takes quite a bit longer a constituent of mine who struggles to walk cannot lift heavy things and cannot even raise her arms above her chest was receiving the disability living allowance on further examination however it was removed four weeks ago she reapplied for a medical assessment but she does not even have a date for it yet if i supply the minister with the details perhaps she will kindly look into the matter in general is the picture not rather a poor one", "is the minister aware that benefit claims for gloucestershire are now dealt with in st austell and that claims in cornwall are dealt with in gloucester is that not rather an odd situation and are there any proposals in the document published this morning to correct it since jobcentres were instructed not to give advice or to deal with claims the whole process has become inefficient", "given that the recent independent monitoring commission report identified a number of paramilitary organisations that have changed the emphasis of their activities from paramilitary to drug dealing\u2014oglaigh na heireann the continuity irish republican army the irish national liberation army the ulster defence association the loyalist volunteer force and the ulster volunteer force\u2014and given that the street value of seized drugs in northern ireland in 200607

gloucestershire members of parliament individually if necessary the minister will be aware of the difficulties of getting six members of parliament together when it also suits sir michaels diary he is visiting gloucestershire next week when a number of us will not be available to meet him and it is important that we have a chance to talk to him about the situation", "i note that we have a little longer for this debate than might have been expected but i assure the minister that i do not intend to drag it out just for the sake of it however there are of course important issues to address and i am pleased to have secured the debate for that reason i thank mr speaker for awarding it to me and the minister for attending todaymy hon friends and colleagues from other seats in gloucestershire\u2014forest of dean cheltenham gloucester stroud and cotswold\u2014have all taken an interest in what i am discussing although unfortunately they are not able to be here because of other pressures they too have suffered in recent months and i pay tribute to their work in fighting against the difficulties that we have experiencedi want to approach this debate in three parts i want to consider what happened on 20 july and since what is happening now and what should happen in the future in june of this year i remember visiting a number of people in my constituency and by invitation slightly beyond to look at the difficulties they had experienced following floods in that month i visited people who told me that they had lived in their properties for 40 years and never been flooded there was some kind of warning there i suppose the storms were similar although obviously those in july were a lot worse there was a warning in june that there was a problem because places flooded that had never flooded before and it was depressing to me to have to visit those people again in july when they had been flooded for a second timei suppose that 20 july started like any other day but the rain came down very heavily perhaps it should not have but it seemed to take us by surprise the rain continued for a lot of the day probably all of it and peoples journeys home became extremely difficult a journey that should have taken me one hour took me four the mobile phone network went down completely and it was impossible to phone home or make any arrangements i was one of the lucky ones many people did not get home at all my house is not that far from the m5 motorway and i know that people slept in their cars on the motorway including police officers who had no way of getting away from the situation people slept in borough council offices and some slept in public houses which was probably the preferable option but not one they would necessarily have chosen it seemed to get worseon the saturday there seemed to be a little respite but water continued to come from the hills and down the rivers and on sunday things got very much worse as things progressed the town of tewkesbury got cut off and became an island as probably the whole world knows\u2014tewkesbury is now world famous for the wrong reasons i have to stress that other parts of my constituency were also very badly flooded part of the hospital at tewkesbury had to be evacuated the doctors surgery was flooded and had to be evacuated meaning that the doctors were displaced and many businesses were closed of course many people had to leave their homes some of them had to be rescued from their top floor it was a desperate situation when we lost the water supply we had to live off water supplied by bowsers\u2014a word i had never come across before 20 july\u2014and the filling of bowsers and the delivery of bottled water became a major issue   interruption  i am glad to welcome the hon member for stroud mr drew who has managed to make it to the debatetragically and worst of all during the next few days three people lost their lives as a direct result of the flooding bramwell and christopher lane and mitchell taylor were all killed that was extremely tragic but it could have been so much worse we lost our mains water supply\u2014some people lost it for up to three weeks\u2014and as many as 350000 properties were affected in this way we very nearly lost our electricity supplies it was estimated that up to 600000 households could have lost electricityat this point i would like to congratulate the emergency services particularly gold command under the direction of dr tim brain the chief constable of gloucestershire i would like to congratulate the armed forces tewkesbury borough council parish councils and many others\u2014particularly those individuals who helped rescue people and deliver bottled water it really brought out the very best in 99 per cent of people there were no divisions and no party politics everybody made a tremendous effort i personally knew many people who worked hard but there were many others whom i did not know and whom i will probably not meet againperhaps unusually for a politician i would like to congratulate the media on their role especially radio gloucestershire a local radio station which broadcast accurate and uptodate information every minute that was extremely helpful perhaps unusually again for a politician i would like to thank and congratulate the supermarkets and those who supplied the bottled watermost hon members realise the importance of their staff i want especially to congratulate my constituency assistant mark calway who worked night and day to try to help people with their problems far be it from me as a conservative member of parliament to try to brighten up the prime ministers week but i must thank him for what he did he showed a great deal of interest and i am not prepared to play party politics about the matter his many interventions were welcome i also thank and congratulate the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs and everybody at every level including those in cobra and gold command who tried to help to alleviate the disaster i am told that it was the biggest operation in peacetime britain and that is significant", "i am grateful for that intervention the hon gentleman is absolutely right and has made one of the most important points i shall deal with that a little later but i emphasise that he is rightthe second part of my speech is about the current position tewkesbury and the surrounding areas have recovered well but many people are still living in caravans on their own drives and will do so for many months in a discussion with the chief constable this morning i was reminded that they will have to eat their christmas dinner in caravans unless they are fortunate enough to be invited elsewhere many people remain displaced from their homes businesses especially shops pubs and restaurants lost much business when we lost the water supply restaurants could not prepare food properly and consequently lost an awful lot of business however i want to convey the message that although some people believe that tewkesbury was like new orleans it was not that bad tewkesbury was not affected in quite the same way and it is open for business i hope that i am allowed to make that plugof course people have still got to get their houses back together and make insurance claims the process of claiming appears to have gone fairly smoothly\u2014i have not heard many complaints about it\u2014although it took time for assessors and others to come out given the scale of the problem that was understandable but matters are progressingconcern has been expressed about future insurance premiums and the future availability of insurance i want to spend some time considering that because yesterday the association of british insurers made the worrying statement that it could not guarantee insuring people against flooding in future because of the chancellors statement the other day and the lack of money as the association put it from him for the alleviation of floods i hope that the chancellor will provide enough money to guard against future problems and i want to discuss shortly some of the things that i hope will be donei am also a little concerned about the abis position although i do not want to be too much against it i asked the abi what specific schemes it felt would not be able to go ahead because of the governments position that it felt should go ahead again i am not defending the government at all but i was a bit concerned this morning to receive an email from the abi that in answer\u2014or nonanswer\u2014to my question saidwe do not have details of specific schemes that will now not go aheadi am not defending the government\u2014i will say quite a few things that i want the government to do\u2014but i do not want the abi to use the governments position as a copout that is not the abis role insurers take the premiums and they have to pay out it will be difficult for people if they cannot get insurance there might be some justifiable criticism of people or businesses who did not take out insurance but if insurance is not available to them that is a different proposition i should like the minister to address that concerni come to part three of my speech what do i think should happen in the future we live on the confluence of two rivers in tewkesbury it is a beautiful place we have the abbey and we have a lot going for us the rivers brought a lot of trade in the past but of course we recognise that tewkesbury is on a floodplain and that the rivers flood frequently the fields around tewkesbury flood probably two three or four times a year that is not a problem what is a problem is the kind of situation that we face currentlyalthough we accept that we live on a floodplain and that sometimes we will be flooded peoples primary concern now is that we should learn lessons from what happened it is far too easy for the headlines to disappear for people to forget about the situation and for nothing to happen i hope that we will learn the lessons i make no apology for returning to the fact that three people died in my constituency because of the flooding or that people beyond have suffered we must learn the lessons what do i think those lessons are the biggest one is that we should not build houses or other buildings on or near floodplains if we do that the water obviously has nowhere to go or not as many places to go whereas if the floodplain is a green field the water can rest on it and eventually disappear if there are buildings on that field that cannot happenone area of building in my constituency in a place called bredon road was part built and flooded that was not a good calculation in a written answer to my question number 146213 the minister for housing quoted planning policy statement 25 with regard to strategic flood risk assessments that is welcome as far as it goes but i do not think that it goes far enough i know that the role of the environment agency has to some extent been strengthened on that point\u2014i shall return to that\u2014but the provision does not go anywhere near far enoughi am also concerned about how we determine what constitutes a floodplain when the environment secretary came to tewkesbury he told me that the flooding that had occurred was far worse than the definitive map which suggested where the flooding might take place if the 1947 floods were repeated the flooding this time was worse i had a meeting with somebody from the environment agency who suggested that if water lay beneath the surface of land it was okay to build on that is profoundly wrong and dangerousthere is currently an application which will be with the secretary of state any day now at a village called longford in my constituency which is very close to walham electric works which almost flooded and which we almost lost the appeal to the secretary of state is by hitchins and is to build some 600 houses on an area that floods and to which the access roads also flood surely that application must be turned down when it reaches the secretary of states office otherwise we will have heard just empty words", "i thank the hon gentleman for making that pointthere are areas of tewkesbury such as the wheatpieces estate and the stonehills estate of which people said well there you are they didnt flood it wasnt a problem that misses the point entirely the next estate priors park estate was very badly flooded we are also losing gardens houses are being built on gardens which are defined as brownfield sites and that land loses the ability to soak up waterthat raises the question of why so many houses are needed i do not want to go through all the issues we know about ageing populations about couples separating about people wanting more than one house and about immigration\u2014we have had net immigration of well over a million in the past 10 years all those factors put pressure on the housing situation and we have to think about this very sensiblyunbelievably there are proposals from the regional spatial strategy in my constituency to build thousands of houses north of gloucester and north of cheltenham that is asking for trouble and the proposal must be rejected we must find a better way forward and better places to put the houses we cannot build thousands of houses in the areas that have suffered so badly over the past few weekswhen we have to build houses the builders should have a greater responsibility to ensure that the drainage system is adequate in answer to my parliamentary question number 146214 the minister helpfully replied but his answer was not strong enough things need tightening up we also need to ensure that ditches and drains are cleared regularly and that they are repaired when necessary i had some displaced people living with me for a while they were delightful they lived much higher up than me but their house unlike mine had flooded because their drains did not work in fact they had worked in reverse and thrown the water out into the property i accept that that was an exceptional time but in many cases the drains were simply inadequate and the ditches were not cleanedwe need to draw up a list of priority people and priority buildings so that we can help more quickly in times of difficulty i went for a walkabout on the sunday and i came across some sheltered accommodation nobody had been there and water was surrounding the buildings it was coming up through the floors of the flats and we had to push people out in their wheelchairs to avoid what could have been a terrible situation we then had to wait for ambulances and police cars to arrive this place was called lanes court in priors park the estate that i mentioned earlier nobody had been round to check up on it it had not registered on anyones radar screen there was no emergency relief for those peoplei tabled a parliamentary question on that subject\u2014question number 152885\u2014to which the minister respondedunder central guidance on the requirements of the civil contingencies act 2004 it is the responsibility of all the statutorily designated category 1 responders including local authorities emergency services primary care trusts and the environment agency to identify and make plans to assist vulnerable people in any emergency\u2014 official report 26 july 2007 vol 463 c 1523wwell in spite of what i am sure were the best efforts of all involved that did not happen it certainly did happen to some extent but many people such as those whom i have just mentioned did not get rescued until they happened to be stumbled across many old and disabled people had bottled water brought to their houses but that did not happen across the board there were still many vulnerable peoplethe fire and rescue service made an absolutely tremendous effort but i do not think that it was quite prepared for a disaster of this scale in terms of the number of its officers who have been trained to carry out rescue operations in water some are trained to do that and did an excellent job others also did an excellent job but we need to reflect more on whether there are enough fire rescue officers trained in that particular line of servicei spoke to the chief constable of gloucestershire this morning about the triservice centre it is a pity that the hon member for stroud is no longer in his place as i hoped that he would agree with me about it on 20 july the emergency services people were able to talk to each other immediately at the operational level nothing needed to be set up they managed the emergency very well indeed and it would not have been as effective if it had had to be managed regionally the local emergency people all knew the local council people people from the utilities mps and so forth it is interesting to note that when the merger of police forces was first discussed relevant documents observed that a force as small as gloucestershires would not be able to handle an emergency on this scale in fact the force handled it very well indeed i thus make a plea for the triservice centre to be retained it is working well and should be allowed to continue to do soas to securing water and electricity supplies which the hon member for stroud mentioned we have to ensure that the mythe water works located close to my home is protected we cannot allow hundreds of thousands of people to lose their drinking water again in respect of the walham electricity works\u2014one substation apparently serves 600000\u2014it cannot be right to put people into such a vulnerable position i understand that hesco bastions which are protective borders have been put around the mythe works on a temporary basis with the possibility of them becoming permanent but i have to say that this is not rocket science it should be simple to provide those protections which must become permanent at mythe walham and elsewherewe also need to secure a network of alternative supplies it is strange that so many people who could lose their water supplies are dependent on just one service or one water treatment plant when the prime minister went there during the crisis his first remarks were something like this is rather an old building or an old service station isnt it well he had a good point the plant usually works very well and the people employed there work hard but so many peoples water should not be dependent on one particular water treatment plant and the same applies to electricityi want to touch on the role of severn trent it is perhaps understandable that it was totally overwhelmed by what happened however it operates\u2014i suppose inevitably\u2014as a monopoly so it is in a different position people cannot choose to go elsewhere for their water a great deal of anger was directed at severn trent some of it may not have been justified but i can certainly understand quite a lot of it i suggest that severn trent should be more a part of the community and should update its emergency planning there was a tremendous effort in tewkesbury to get bowsers and bottles of water to everybody i believe that we ended up with most of the available bowsers in the country so what would have happened if there had been a similar emergency somewhere else in the country all the water companies need to be aware of what can happen and ensure that they can respond to these situations more strongly if they occur againi come on to the environment agency some years ago the environment agency was monitoring a chemical treatment plant operated by cleansing service group and based in sandhurst in my constituency it was watching it so closely that the whole thing blew up one day and it simply did not carry out its job properly i have many criticisms of the environment agency and i shall run through a few issues that are linked to it if they are not currently its responsibility perhaps they should bei have already mentioned drainage but i want to touch on the responsibility for brooks rivers waterways and drains in answer to my parliamentary question 148307 the minister saiddrainage is a complex issue and responsibility rests with water and sewerage companies the environment agency local authorities and private owners\u2014 official report 16 july 2007 vol 463 c 9wit is too complicated\u2014too many issues fall between two stools the responsibility needs to be clearly definedthe environment agency has become a statutory consultee in planning applications that is not strong enough it needs to have a much greater say in whether certain planning applications are granted it needs a better and faster warning system the environment agency claims to have warned many thousands of people but many people were not warned about what was coming farmers were particularly affected and while i pay tribute to the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the national farmers union for their excellent work in getting water to many livestock there was a big problem with the warning system which needs to be examinedspending on specific national flood defence projects is necessary but individual flood defences also need to be up to scratch the environment agency needs more responsibility more powers adequate funding and more confidence to sort out problems or else it needs scrapping as it stands it serves no useful purpose we cannot leave it as it iswe heard a lot about the weather that led to such problems being unprecedented i shall steal a phrase from the chief constable of gloucestershire\u2014i warned him that i would\u2014who was the head of gold command he said that if such weather happens again it will not be unprecedented we will have gone through it before in july this year i am glad to welcome to the chamber the hon member for forest of dean mr harper who also suffered and worked hard during these difficulties i thank him for offering to help me out when it was difficult for me to be in three or four places at oncethe weather might have been unprecedented this time but if it happens again it will not be unprecedented it might have been a oncein150years event we are told that the effects of climate change will be severe so we cannot take the view that it will not happen for another 150 years heaven forbid it could happen tomorrow next week next month or next year\u2014perhaps it will not happen for another 150 years but we simply cannot take the chanceas we know tewkesbury is an area that will flood but let us not make it worse than it needs to be let us do everything that we can to lessen and mitigate the damage of any future heavy rainfall more than anything people who have suffered and are still

the criminal justice system we recognised however that there was some way to go regarding dissident republicans and loyalist paramilitaries so we supported the retention of an ability to hold a trial without jury we welcomed the change of emphasis however and the change to a presumption that trials would be held with a jury unless otherwise stated by the director of public prosecutions\u2014although we disputed who should actually make the decisioni have one further question for the minister if these aspects were to be devolved in due course what would happen there is

take up all the allocated time in committee", "i begin by thanking my team who worked in committee in particular i thank my hon friend the member for wellingborough mr bone who as the minister said earlier hardly missed a minute and made a number of valuable contributions i also thank the ministers and their officials for the way in which they have always been prepared to discuss outside the chamber aspects of the bill that has been very useful and i hope that it has led to a more informed debate than might otherwise have been the casei want to echo what the minister has just said i hope that the executive can be formed we have spent many hours discussing northern ireland issues upstairs as a function of statutory instruments which are not amendable and which we must take or leave that is not the best way to run northern ireland and i hope that the process comes to an end i represent an english seat and visit northern ireland as much as i can but i cannot possibly have the same knowledge or feel for the issues as people in northern ireland so i hope that progress can be madealthough we welcome the recent statement by sinn fein the bill reminds us that not all things are as they should be in northern ireland as the minister has recognised the fact that trials without juries are still going ahead albeit on a decreasing level is testament to that as we said in committee and again today we are concerned about how the decision on the mode of a trial is arrived at i would still prefer the lord chief justice to make that decision instead of the dpp i hope that the minister might reconsider thatin committee i expressed concern about the stopandsearch powers given to the police and the army while i recognise that they are needed the police should be given time that is judged reasonable rather than time that they feel is necessary that is a small point but it could be important given that the province is improving to such an extent the fact that those powers still exist is a sad reminder that everything is not quite rightin committee we questioned the governments extension of the powers of the human rights commission we do not particularly approve of that but it will not cause us to vote against the bill which we support and wish wellthere is another matter that would more properly be dealt with through a new clause but it was not possible to do so the police in northern ireland would like to have some of the powers contained in the police and criminal evidence act 1984 with regard to setting bail conditions pace does not apply in northern ireland which is subject to the police and criminal evidence northern ireland order 1989 as amended having taken advice it became clear to us that it would be enormously difficult to design a new clause to achieve that\u2014indeed a whole new section of the bill would have been required\u2014so we were unable to table one i do not know whether it would be possible to do so in another place\u2014probably not for the same reasons however perhaps the government could reconsider the matterin conclusion it has been a pleasure to take part in the debates on the bill and i wish it well", "i am grateful to the minister for returning with an amendment which we are happy to support returning to the point made by the hon member for foyle mark durkan if the certificate does not contain information how might somebody who wants to appeal against a decision on the grounds listed in the amendment bring that about the odds would be stacked against them", "given that we are talking about trials going ahead without juries which is unusual that is a political decision it is not one for the judiciary to decide it is for politicians to decide if we are saying that in certain circumstances trials should go ahead without juries surely it is for us to say who should make that decision it is not right that the person responsible for bringing the prosecution should decide whether there is a judge or whether there is a jury it is not his role to do that", "in the amendments that i tabled which were not selected i called for the lord chief justice of northern ireland to make that decision i entirely agree with the point that the hon gentleman is making", "i shall speak briefly in support of the amendment moved by the hon member for argyll and bute mr reid about who decides on the mode of trial we discussed the matter at great length in committee so i shall not detain the house for too longi am not certain which amendment if any the hon gentleman intends to press to a vote but we share his concern about the dpp deciding the mode of trial as the dpp is responsible for the prosecution it does not seem fair or right that he should decide how the trial is conducted especially as there are only limited means to challenge the decisioni do not support the hon gentleman in his attempt to remove clause 7 as the government have made a genuine attempt to address the concerns raised in committee and i am grateful to the minister for that however i am still uncomfortable about the fact that the dpp who is responsible for prosecuting can take a decision about how the court should be run", "this measure does not only address the possibility of the assembly getting stuck over choosing a model it allows the secretary of state to set up the department in the first place that is the problem the measure is not only about the model it gives the secretary of state the power to set up the department if the assembly does not pass the act to set it up", "we have had a very long debate on the new clause\u2014and deservedly so as it is extremely important i go back to the ministers words when he first proposed the legislation some time ago he mentioned the historic decision of the ard fheis of sinn fein to support policing but it is only right\u2014for the reasons provided by the hon member for belfast east mr robinson\u2014not to agree to devolve policing and justice just yet we want to see what sinn fein means by support for the police the speech of mr adams was littered with the words suggesting that this was the way to the the united ireland that he desired perhaps we should see whether the murderers of mr mccartney or the perpetrators of the northern bank robbery are handed over it remains the polices view that that robbery was carried out by the ira so the ira has a long way to go to prove that it means what it says but we have to accept that it is a step forwardi am rather concerned about new clause 5 i spoke briefly to the minister about it earlier and i am grateful to him for his time having looked into it in rather more detail i remain concerned i very rarely disagree with the hon member for belfast east on these issues he will remember that in 1998 i was one of the very few members to join him in the lobby and he knows exactly where i am coming from on this however i really think that that new clause weakens the triple lock although it does not remove it completelysubsection 5cprovides for the department to be in the charge of a northern ireland minister elected by the assembly and for that minister to be supported by a deputy minister elected by the assembly\u2014and those elections will require crosscommunity support i accept that the new department cannot be up and running but it seems very clear indeed that the department can be set up if according to the new clauseit appears to the secretary of state that there is no reasonable prospect that the assembly will pass an act of the kind described in subsection 1a and bin that case the secretary of statemay lay before parliament the draft of an order in councilsubsections 1a and b are effectively action to set up the department it is very clear to me that the secretary of state can assume the power to override nonaction by the assembly and then to set up the departmenti am sorry that i cannot agree with the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik on this but i remain very concerned the minister said earlier that he would come back to me on what i accept is a very complicated matter he is always very willing to discuss these matters so i take it that he will be happy to meet me for a discussion before the bill reaches the other place as i say it is a matter of great concern to me", "i do not know whether the triple lock is in place with regard to the first and deputy first minister it is in place with regard to the election of the justice minister and the deputy minister but the triple lock is not otherwise in place we have talked about triple locks and quadruple locks but it seems that we have now come down to a single lock that might be sufficient but this is getting a bit complicatedi do not want to take up any more of the houses time on this issue which we have aired at length we cannot come to an agreement on it but i am grateful to the minister for his offer to discuss the matter later he is always accessible and willing to meet to discuss any issues and i will be happy to take him up on that offer because i am not satisfied indeed the debate has changed as it has gone along it has been a long debate and what we are saying now is not quite what we were saying at the beginning so i will seek to have that meeting with him before the bill makes any progress in another placenew clause 4 tabled by the hon member for foyle mark durkan relates to intelligence gathering we are happy to support the government on the transfer of responsibility for intelligence gathering to mi5 having said that i remain a little concerned about the accountability of the security services as i said to the hon member for foyle in committee i have also told him that i remain concerned about the events leading up to omagh a matter that i have looked into i share his concern about that but i do not think that his new clause is the right way to go although it raises some important issues we remain convinced that we should transfer responsibility for intelligence gathering to mi5 i shall not seek to divide the house on new clause 5 but i reserve the right to reconsider the matter later", "the hon gentleman is right the point is covered by proposed new subsection 7ac which states that the assembly must still elect the minister and the deputy minister new clause 5 gives the secretary of state the power to override the assembly in setting up the department the hon gentleman may be happy with that but i am not", "surely that will depend on what the secretary of state puts in the order which as the hon gentleman knows is not amendable such an order would go through because the government have a majority proposed new subsection 7abprovides that the purpose of the department is to exercise functions consisting wholly or mainly of devolved policing and justice functionsuncharacteristically the hon gentleman is prepared to extend a little bit more trust to the government than me", "before the minister finishes will he return to the issue raised by the hon member for north down lady hermon i find it a little confusing new clause 55 includes the provisionif it appears to the secretary of state that there is no reasonable prospect that the assembly will pass an act of the kind described in subsection 1a and b he may lay before parliament the draft of an orderwhich will establisha new northern ireland departmentit is confusing because subsection 1a and b replace subsections 1 and 2 of the northern ireland miscellaneous provisions act 2006 is not the secretary of state given the power to introduce the department even though the assembly has not agreed to do so i am a little confused about the wording", "i raised this issue with the minister earlier and he has kindly agreed to come back to us on it later i want to draw the attention of my hon friends in the democratic unionist party to subsection 5 of the new clause which provides that the secretary of state may establish a new department ifthere is no reasonable prospect that the assembly will pass an act of the kind describedin subsection 2 of the new clause subsection 2 overrides subsections 1 and 2 of the northern ireland miscellaneous provisions act 2006 i do not have the benefit of the technical support that the minister has but as far as i can see this means that the only act that will now be applicable is the one referred to in subsection 2 of the new clause", "yes subsection 21a and b my reading of the new clause is that proposed new subsection 7a will override that but i might be wrong this is worth exploring i entirely agree with the concerns that have been expressed by my hon friends in the dup", "is the minister therefore saying that if the secretary of state perhaps as a last resort were to impose the model that model would then go back to the assembly in which case it could well be that that the assembly would still be unable to decide exactly who should take up the positions is that a possible scenario", "perhaps i could have another try the house understands that the government are taking the power to impose the model\u2014we can draw a thick black line under that we are trying to draw out from the minister whether he will under any circumstances have the right\u2014the power\u2014to impose a stated person to be a minister or shadow minister will he have that power or not it is a fairly simple question", "to ask the minister of state department for constitutional affairs who the members of the ministerial steering group on compensation culture are", "to ask the minister of

letter that the commission sent to all members of parliament it said that the commission recognised that some farmers are experiencing difficultiesbut there are fewer of these than we had expectedwill the secretary of state tell the commission that in fact a lot of farmers especially milk producers are really struggling far be it from me to advocate a return to production subsidies\u2014i certainly do not\u2014but one problem is that since the ending of that system the supermarkets have got away with pressing down the price of milk at the farm gate which has caused milk producers considerable hardship will the secretary of state have a word with the commission about that", "to ask the secretary of state for transport at what stage the application for government funding to build a parkway

committee and for the competent and occasionally humorous way in which you did iti thank my hon friends who have been with me most of the time as the minister said my hon friend the member for northeast milton keynes who unfortunately is not with us today and my hon friends the members for peterborough and for wellingborough made several telling interventionsi thank the minister for his approach to the bill he said at the outset that he would listen and think about the issues he has quite a bit of work to do before the bill becomes law as he kindly said that he would reconsider several matterson a wider basis i thank the northern ireland office for its approach to legislation it offers briefings to opposition members and facilities when we travel to the province that is very much appreciated such actions help to avoid unnecessary party political squabbles and enhance the quality of the debates i thank the minister\u2019s officials the clerk and hansard for their help as welli wish the bill well we highlighted several issues and concerns they may sometimes appear to be small but they can have a disproportionately bad effect so we have been right to raise them i have very much enjoyed the committee and i look forward to the next stage of consideration", " where is that", " perhaps i should have raised this as a point of order as it is not really the minister\u2019s responsibility but i hope you will allow me to make the point sir nicholas the bill is entitled the justice and security northern ireland bill and it is important to ensure that the public bill committee accurately reflects the possible relevance of the bill to in this case scottish members", " the hon gentleman is touching on a very important subject i looked and continue to look very closely at the omagh situation does he not feel that something as important as what one might describe as the overseeing of the security services should be done on a national basis\u2014a united kingdom basis he may well have a point that it is necessary because it is possible for people to get away with anything on the basis of \u201coh it\u2019s national security\u201d i am uncomfortable with that as well \u00a0because almost anything can be excused but does he not think that the matter should be tackled more on a uk basis", " i support the hon lady\u2019s remarks but i make the point that it is unsatisfactory to deal with issues under statutory instruments that apply only to northern ireland not least because such measures are not amendablewe have mentioned the fact that certain elements of the bill could be dealt with by statutory instrument will the minister confirm that a committee to consider northern ireland legislation could not consider matters extending to scotland for example", " is the hon gentleman saying that the provision could be extended for another 12 months but no longer than that", " but no further", " perhaps i did not explain myself properly would there be only one further period or could it be repeatedly extended", " i beg to move amendment no 23 in clause 34 page 23 line 8 at end insert\u2018 but all breaches of the code shall subject the police officer to disciplinary procedures\u2019i shall not disappoint you this time sir nicholas having examined the bill more closely i realised that it was not necessary to move the previous amendmentclause 341 refers to the effect of the code and states\u201ca failure by a police officer to comply with a provision of a code shall not of itself make him liable to criminal or civil proceedings\u201dmy amendment is designed to give us the facility to discuss why that subsection is in the bill and what the minister envisages would happen if a police officer did not comply with the code which has been compiled by the secretary of state and approved by both houses of parliament", " i am grateful to the minister forthat explanation i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " i was about to make the same point as the hon member for north down my reading of the clause suggests that members of her majesty\u2019s forces are not required to make a record i understand that\u2014", " is the minister intervening on my intervention", " secondly i understand that the army does not normally work on an authorisation basis but when a member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty reasonably believes that a person is unlawfully detained in such circumstances that his life is in danger\u2014there cannot be a more serious situation\u2014he will have to obtain authorisation under clause 24 unless i am reading it wrong i cannot understand that difference between clauses 22 and 24", " i had almost forgotten that it was my amendment we were discussing as the discussion has gone on for so long i said that it was a probing amendment and we can safely say that we have probed but i am not satisfied by the minister\u2019s response as to why the personnel we are discussing do not need permission to enter premises they are not going to just enter and stand there presumably they are going to do something when they get in under clause 24 however they need permission to enter even though that clause seems to relate to a more urgent circumstance\u2014someone\u2019s life being in dangeri cannot understand the reason for the difference between clauses 22 and 24 and i would be happy if the minister agreed to discuss that difference with his officials to see whether the provisions could be tightened up a little that said we have had a good discussion", " i thank the minister for that intervention and look forward to discussing the issue with him further perhaps but we have probed and he has been generous and accommodating so i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " briefly and on the same lines as i questioned the minister on why it is necessary to extend the powers of the police under clause 20\u2014i was desperately searching through the terrorism act 2000 but we reached clause 21 before i could find the relevant provision\u2014will he explain why it is necessary at this stage to introduce powers that i think he said do not exist for her majesty\u2019s forces given that we are supposed to be moving towards normalisationmy second question concerns subsection 1 which begins\u201cif a member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty reasonably suspects\u201dare we going to continue to use \u201csuspects\u201d or will it be \u201cbelieves\u201d in future i am struggling to understand what subsection 2 means perhaps the minister will clarify the situation", " but they do now", " on a slightly different point about subsection 2 the minister has said that members of the armed forces do not need to give a reason when making an arrest is he comfortable with that i accept his explanation that they are not trained to handle such situations but there must be a reason why the police have to give a reason for an arrest the person being arrested will presumably not have listened to this \u00a0debate and will not know why they have not been given the reasons for being arrested is the minister comfortable with that", " i beg to move amendment no 21 in clause 22 page 17 line 5 leave out from \u2018in\u2019 to end of line 6 and insert\u2018order to prevent paramilitary activity or to obtain evidence relating to suspected paramilitary activity\u2019sir nicholas you are probably aware that one or two other committee members have also been delayed by the weather for example the conservative whip the hon member for northeast milton keynes has been delayedi do not want to labour my point as we have hada long discussion about similar amendments the amendment deals with the provisions on entry inclause 22 which states\u201ca member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty or a constable may enter any premises if he considers it necessary\u201dmy amendment would insert the words\u201cin order to prevent paramilitary activity or to obtain evidence relating to suspected paramilitary activity\u201das the hon member for north down has pointed out the clause starts by referring to a member of her majesty\u2019s forces or a constable but from subsection 2 onwards it refers only to a constable if the rest of the clause referred to members of her majesty\u2019s forces as well i would not have tabled the amendment i say that because the constable has to obtain authorisation where it is reasonably practicable to do so from\u201can officer of the police service of northern ireland of at least the rank of superintendent\u201da member of her majesty\u2019s forces does not as far as i can read have to obtain any authorisation so i thought it wise to suggest that we might want to strengthen the reasons for making such an entry", " i take the hon gentleman\u2019s point but clause 241 states\u201ca member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty who reasonably believes that a person is unlawfully detained in such circumstances that his life is in danger may enter\u201dsubsection 2 states that a member of her majesty\u2019s forces\u201cmay enter a dwellingonly if he is authorised for the purpose by a commissioned officer of her majesty\u2019s forces\u201dthat contradicts clause 22 slightlyi understand the hon gentleman\u2019s point but i am a little surprised that there is a difference between a constable who must obtain authorisation where it is reasonably practicable and a member of her majesty\u2019s forces who need not i will not press the amendment which is just a probing amendment to draw out the minister\u2019s explanation", " i am following the hon lady\u2019s argument and the minister\u2019s explanation closely i am concerned about the extra punishment that she is seeking to introduce which is based on amendments that i tabled had i succeeded in getting those amendments through i would have been more comfortable with a stronger punishment but as i did not i am not as comfortable does she follow that argument and would she like to comment", " given that we are returning to a situation of normalisation to use the minister\u2019s words why is it necessary to give her majesty\u2019s forces or the police even more powers", " the minister has not quite answered my question the question is why now why were those powers not introduced in 1972 at the height of the troubles or more recently the dup is almost sitting down with sinn fein and the imc report says that the ira is not involved in paramilitary activity so why is it necessary to extend army and police powers", " the wording of amendment no 19 is lifted from elsewhere in the bill so the government accept that such a situation is the only time that individuals can be stopped for this particular kind of questioning subsection 2 says\u201ca member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty may stop a person for so long as is necessary to question himabout a recent explosion or another recent incident endangering lifewhat he knows about a person\u201dthat qualifies why individuals can be stopped under subsection 2 subsection 1 does not actually state why the member of her majesty\u2019s forces or the constable would want to stop that person they could just stop them for no reason at all for as long as they feel necessary i suggest that subsection 1 is at least badly worded and probably worse than that", " the minister used an interesting phrase when he said that the context was that wewere moving toward normalisation but the word \u201cnecessary\u201d is not normal in this context the word \u201creasonable\u201d is i am afraid that he has done the reverse of selling the case to meon the reasonable test of the man on the clapham omnibus i came in by bus this morning so i consider myself that reasonable man members in committee yesterday probably did not think so but that was a different matter i have watched a video of whiterock with the police and it was a terrible situation if a constable or member of her majesty\u2019s forces needed to detain someone hurling rocks at the police\u2014as some were\u2014in order to question them about their identity and movements and if that person did not comply i would think that the person questioning them would be entitled to detain them for a substantial amount of time i would consider that reasonable what i do not consider as moving toward normalisation is the insertion of the word \u201cnecessary\u201d it is openended and not generally accepted as a legal term whereas \u201creasonable\u201d most certainly is given that i am sorry to tell the minister that i am not happy with his explanation and that i will press the amendment to a division", " to coin a phrase", " the clause is written with reference to \u201cperson\u201d rather than \u201cperson or organisation\u201d which gives rise to the concern expressed by the hon member for north down i know that it is difficult to give a specific example without warning but could the minister give an example of the sort of cases that the powers will enable the commission to investigate", " it is duplication", " i beg to move amendment no 18 in clause 20 page 16 line 11 leave out \u2018necessary\u2019 and insert \u2018reasonable\u2019", " the amendments refer to the stop and question powers of a member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty or a constable the clause says\u201ca member of her majesty\u2019s forces on duty or a constable may stop a person for so long as is necessary to question him to ascertain his identity and movements\u201dwhy is \u201cnecessary\u201d used rather than \u201creasonable\u201d which is more frequently used in such cases another amendment in the group before us would qualify subsection 1 by adding\u201cif he suspects that he may be able to provide information about a recent explosion or another recent incident endangering life or the effects thereof\u201dmy amendments would offer a belt and braces approach one tries to change the wording to \u201creasonable\u201d rather than \u201cnecessary\u201d and another would add the provision that there must be a good reason to stop and question people why has the minister approached the issue as outlined in the clause ", " the minister knows that \u201creasonable\u201d is the most important word in the legal system because as we discussed in a previous sitting the man on the clapham omnibus uses it to determine what is reasonable we cannot discard the word it is in almost if not every bill that we pass why is \u201cnecessary\u201d used here if we consider the matter in terms of the person being stopped \u201cnecessary\u201d means potentially forever", " i shall not go over the arguments raised when i discussed my amendments nor indeed those arguments put forward by the hon members for north down and for east antrim i shall just reiterate my concernclause 14 says insert \u201c69a investigations evidence\u201d and\u201cfor the purpose of an investigationthe commission may by notice in writing require a person\u2014\u201dto provide information documents oral evidence and so forth as hon members have said there is no comeback for the person who is required to provide that evidence unless he has unlimited funds which few people have i remain concerned about the extent of the powers that commission has and indeed seeksin the documents that the commission sent presumably to all hon members on the committee it complains that clause 14 also severely limits the capacity of the commission to investigate anything connected with national security my goodness should a human rights commission be investigating matters of national security it should not but that is its drive the minister does not want it to happen but the commission certainly does", " indeed and i do not accuse the minister of wanting the commission to do so however that is its drive that is the way it is pushing and that is of great concernwith those few remarks i remain dissatisfied with clause 14 i look forward to the minister\u2019s response although we have probably heard most of it already we will see how we go", " it is possible", " when i met the human rights commission some months ago i asked what number of cases it deals with i cannot remember the exact number but it passes on to the relevant agencies something like 90 per cent of the cases that are referred to it if the relevant agency does not then carry out an investigation to the commission\u2019s satisfaction is the commission able to take it up again that seems a ridiculous duplication", " i am grateful for the minister\u2019s explanation of the way in which the clause is worded i remain concerned however for the reasons that i and other opposition members have given as i mentioned the commission often in practice passes a complaint on to a body that it presumably thinks might more appropriately at that point investigate the unlawful acts or the other issues in question the power then to pass judgment on whether the matter has been sufficiently investigated by the other body puts it in a very powerful position\u2014almost more powerful in some ways than the police for example will the commission have available to it all the facts that would be available to the police because it is to be able to judge whether the police for example have sufficiently investigated the unlawful act i am very uncomfortable with thatthat said and having listened to the minister\u2019s explanation perhaps my amendments do not fully address my concerns i do not know whether you are minded to allow a stand part debate on the clause mrs anderson", " we may have to consider voting against the clause i am not satisfied that the role of the commission is likely to be carried out properly given the extension of its powers", " i am grateful to the minister again i still have a lot of concerns about the general drift and about the way in which the commission is going when it was set up under the 1998 act it had considerable powers and it could be argued that they are quite sufficient i am uncomfortable about giving the commission further powers including the power to consider whether\u201cthe matter to which the notice relates has already been sufficiently investigated by another person\u201dbut we will see how the clause stand part debate goes for now however i do not think that the amendments are sufficient so i shall not press them i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " i welcome you to the chair mrs anderson i had not intended to speak to clause 13 because i have two amendments to clause 14 although those could have been tabled under this clause i am concerned about clause 132c which says that\u201cthe commission may act only if there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful act\u201dto save time in our discussions on the next clause i would like the minister to answer one brief question is an unlawful act not better investigated by other authorities that is the motivation behind my amendments to the next clause but it might be more convenient for him to answer that question now", " i beg to move amendment no 15 in clause 14 page 11 line 21 at end insert\u2018 andc establishes that it has not been investigated by another person because it has been determined that it most properly falls to the commission to carry out such an investigation\u2019", " as i said briefly during the short debate on the previous clause i have one or two concerns about the extension of the commission\u2019s powers to which the hon member for north down referred it already has considerable powers under section 698 of the northern ireland act 1998 which states\u201cfor the purpose of exercising its functions under this section the commission may conduct such investigations as it considers necessary or expedient\u201dthat is a wideranging power and the clause extends itmy concern is that under clause 132c\u201cthe commission may act only if there is or would be one or more victims of the unlawful act\u201dthe word \u201cunlawful\u201d prompted me to move the amendment because if there is an unlawful act why would it not be more properly investigated by other authoritiesamendment no 15 would require the commission to establish that there has been no investigation by another person because it has been determined that it most properly falls to the commission to carry out such an investigationunder amendment no 16\u201cthe commission shall give a reason for the issuing of the notice to the person to whom it is issued at the point of issuing it\u201di am asking the minister to explain why an unlawful act would be investigated by the commission surely other bodies might more properly investigate such an act", "to ask the secretary of state for international development what support his department is providing to governments of thirdworld countries to help them provide clean water to their people and if he will make a statement", " i return to the opportunity to appeal against the decision on the basis of dishonesty or bad faith i am not convinced that this would be available under the clause as it is written as my hon friend the member for wellingborough says clause 71 expressly rules it out therefore will the minister try to reword it so that it makes it clear that in certain circumstances\u2014he can specify them if he wishes\u2014it is possible to appeal i do not believe that the present wording of the clause allows that", " it is not very clear", " we are disputing the decision about the mode of the trial not the trial itself it is a fundamental right that if a legal decision has been reached through the wrong channel there is the option of a judicial review that is a fundamental basic right i do not know why clause 73 is in the bill at all when the whole bill is supposed to be compatible with the european convention on human rights if the bill was compatible there would be no need for clause 73", " will the minister tell us which court could consider an appeal on the grounds of dishonesty or bad faith paul goggins rose\u2014interruption", " i thank the minister for his patient explanation as the bill is written it does not give a guarantee that it is impossible to move from one offence to a different offence i assume that the minister is saying that the legislation that prevents that from happening covers northern ireland if it does i suppose that the question is why the subsection was put in the bill if what has been described can happen anyway i am happy to take an intervention", " i am grateful to the minister given that assurance i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " if the amendment that we debated earlier had been accepted\u2014that the lord chief justice for northern ireland should determine such certificates\u2014i probably would not have wanted to speak we have already heard that the bill states at the very front that\u201cmr secretary hain has made the following statement under section 191a of the human rights act 1998 in my view the provisions of the justice and security northern ireland bill are compatible with the convention rights\u201dthey are not if it were otherwise there would be no need for subsection 3 it is ridiculous and as the hon member for foyle said there can be no judicial review i am not a lawyer although i studied law for a while but i am not aware of any other area of law in which judicial review is impossible lawyers on the committee may be able to advise me better but it seems to me that judicial review should be available for any decisions that are not made in the correct manner how do we know that that will not be the case with the bill decisions could be made in an incorrect manner and a judicial review has to be available that is a human right and a basic legal right i have no intention of repeating the remarks made by other hon members but i am concerned", " i beg to move amendment no 11 in clause 5 page 4 line 33 leave out subsections 5 and 6 i raised this matter previously the amendment provides that where the court is not satisfied that a defendant is guilty of an offence that is being tried but is satisfied that he is guilty of another offence of which a jury could have found him guilty after trial the court may convict him of the other offence my concern is that somebody who is tried without jury for a specific offence can be found not guilty of that offence but convicted by that same court without a jury of a completely separate offence is that correct if the second offence is a similar one it could be argued that it would waste a lot of court time to start the trial all over again but if it is very different should it not be considered in a different way and separately i do not wish to drag this out i have raised the matter before and the government came up with all sorts of explanations but i should like to hear what the minister has to say about why they group two offences together", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation is he satisfied that as the bill is drafted the two offences\u2014murder and manslaughter in the example that he gave\u2014would be linked", " as you rightly say sir nicholas this clause is the meat of the bill and it has been discussed for the best part of two sittings as is right so i shall keep my remarks short i entirely understand where the hon member for foyle is coming from that said i support the clause because it at least moves in the right direction it shifts the emphasis and makes a presumption for a trial by jury the reasons why a trial should not be by jury have to be shown although i accept that they do not have to be shown to the defendant i retain my concern i listened to the minister carefully and i think that it should be a matter for the lord chief justice of northern ireland to decide i am still concerned that the person who will carry out the prosecution will decide on the mode of trial and i do not think that that is correct however that is not a strong enough objection to cause me to vote against the clausewe discussed subsection 10 fairly briefly and a number of interesting points came up i accept that it is difficult to determine what an associate is but with respect to the minister the debate showed that there are a number of holes in the attempt that has been made he generously offered to go away and consider it and i urge him to do so as there are a number of holes i cannot see why the words \u201cenduring family relationship\u201d are used it is difficult to define a friend i cannot see why a business partner should not qualify or why a spouse or parent should not qualify too however with those few comments i shall give the clause fairly guarded support but support nevertheless ", " why not", " in that case i admit to being confused as to what the government are trying to achieve to qualify under this provision surely means that there is some kind of relationship as the hon lady has said what difference does it make whether the relationship is an enduring family one or one in which the parties live together if they live together could they not qualify to some extent as friends that may not necessarily be the case but given that \u00a0 paragraphs d and e are so broad i should have thought that they would the minister has said that business partners would not qualify but surely business partners have pretty much an everyday relationship", " i am following the hon gentleman\u2019s argument does he not believe that there is a distinction between friends and relatives i understand his point about third and fourth cousins but whether someone is a relative can be determined fairly which is not necessarily the case with a friend", " i have listened carefully to the minister\u2019s reasons for deciding as he did however on the other side of the argument does he not see that there may be a risk\u2014in a philosophical sense by trying to satisfy people not only that justice has been done but that it can be seen to have been done\u2014that the person who conducts the prosecution will decide who is to make the decision on the outcome of that trial is that not a risk as well", " the minister said earlier that he had considered how best to deliver justice in that respect he said that to go down the route that the hon member for montgomeryshire proposed or the slightly different route that i proposed carried risks unfortunately the minister was intervened on and did not explain what those risks would be will he tell us what he perceives them as being either now or later in his speech", " i shall speak to amendment no 10 and consequential amendments nos 12 13 and 14 which although worded slightly differently are not entirely inconsistent with amendment no 1 which is why they are grouped togetherthe history of trial by jury has formed a central part of law in this country we are entitled to be judged by our peers we should not discard that without very careful thought it is said that there have been special circumstances in northern ireland and that it has been difficult to find 12 people to pass judgment indeed it is felt that many people have escaped justice because of the intimidation not only of jurors but of potential witnesses if we accept that then another way of looking at it is to say that to have nonjury trials in such circumstances will add to the resentment that is felt by many in northern ireland that would be very unfortunatetherefore i welcome this small step forward because there is now a presumption that there will be a jury trial whereas previously the presumption was that there would not be one in certain circumstances my concern is that the certificate is to be issued by the director of public prosecutions this is not a personal matter but it strikes me as a little incestuous if the \u00a0person responsible for carrying out the prosecution is also to determine the type of court that will try the case it seems far better to take the matter to a neutral person\u2014the lord chief justice of northern ireland as we suggesti have not heard the government\u2019s explanation for the measure but it is not very judicial that the person charged with bringing the prosecution can in effect make up his own rules that is why i propose that the lord chief justice should issue the certificate and i look forward to hearing the minister\u2019s explanation as to why he has not gone down that road", " i welcome you to the chair sir nicholas having served under your chairmanship before i know exactly what delights await usas the minister said four days should be ample time to consider the bill i certainly hope so although one can never be certain with northern ireland legislation although the opposition officially oppose such guillotine motions i believe that on this occasion we should have enough timelike the minister i hope that the assembly will be up and running shortly not because important issues have to be dealt with in bills such as the one before us but because as all hon members know much northern ireland legislation is enacted through the many statutory instruments that come before committee indeed one was debated last week one is being debated tomorrow and i believe that there are two next week it is a most unsatisfactory way to govern a part of the united kingdom i hope that the parties in northern ireland can find their way forward the minister says that the deadline of 26 march is not negotiable i remind him that that was said about 24 november but given the prime minister\u2019s \u00a0shortening tenure of office i think that 26 march will be a definite date on this occasioni look forward to debating the bill in general we do not have a problem with it although we shall want to explore one or two issues and to seek the minister\u2019s guidance on one or two matters in general however i am sure that our debates will be constructive i am heartened by the fact that the minister said that he will take on board what is said in committee it is typical of him to listen to the debate as do all northern ireland ministers and their officials are accommodating to the opposition that usually leads to a high standard of debate", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what discussions she has had with the government of the democratic

socalled loyalist side were completely disarmed and an end were put to all paramilitary activity but would it not also be good if there could be an end to all criminality on both sides of the divide in northern ireland as a recent report from the select committee on northern ireland affairs highlighted that remains a big problem in the province so should not that take place now", "i am grateful to the minister for giving way and i congratulate my hon friend the member for forest of dean mr harper on securing the debate in rural areas i understand that the target response time for police is

ireland bill it makes a change to be debating a northern ireland measure on the floor of the house rather than in committee long may that continue at least until the assembly is up and running as we hope that it will be very soon i will return to that prospect in a few momentslet me run through some of the comments made by hon members the right hon member for torfaen mr murphy again spoke in a northern ireland debate and gave us the benefit of his experience of being secretary of state for northern irelandthe hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik has also been representing the liberal democrats on the welsh grand committee today so he has done well to be in two places at once he made detailed comments about the problems that the dpp might face when deciding whether to issue a certificate for certain offences because of the vague guidelines he also objected as we do to the absence of any appeal mechanism i am sure that we will return in committee to the good points that he madei had the pleasure of listening to the hon member for foyle mark durkan for three quarters of an hour in a meeting yesterday he spoke for a similar length of time today but he is always well worth listening to he made an interesting comment about how although in one sense this is the end of the diplock courts the bill puts the system on the books without an end to it he also spoke interestingly about national security considerations with respect to the minister i do not think that he gave the hon member for foyle an adequate response although i am sure that he will be able to clarify his position further while it is important that we support the security services which have a tremendously difficult job to do i sometimes worry that when we leave things open and vague almost anything can be excused as a matter of national security we saw that happening when the government attempted to introduce 90day detention i would also like a little more clarification on the matter\u2014if not today perhaps in committeemy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee made several good points he asked why the bill could not have waited until next year so that we could have found out what had happened in northern ireland that view was echoed by several hon members especially those from the democratic unionist party i give my hon friend a promise that we will test that matter again in committeeowing to the slightly early start of the windups the hon member for blaydon mr anderson has not yet managed to return to the chamber although he mentioned the fact that we have moved on considerably he rightly referred to the difficulties that still exist in northern irelandthe right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley paid a warm tribute to the diplock judges and the work that they have carried out in difficult circumstances i think that the whole house would endorse what he said in that respect he said that he regretted the need to continue to hold some trials without juries but he stressed that there is a need to do so at the moment in both an intervention and his speech he questioned the role of the northern ireland human rights commission and the human rights commissioner he cited a detailed objection to the particular person in that position but his more general point was to ask whether there is actually a need for the commission and what work it carries out again i will return to that very matter and the extension of the powers of the commissioner in committeethe hon member for south down mr mcgrady was a little bit more supportive of the human rights commissioner whereas the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson spoke of the need as he saw it for the army powers and diplock courts but not for the nihrc the hon member for belfast south dr mcdonnell spoke in detail about his concerns on trials conducted without a jury the hon member for south antrim dr mccrea spoke in support of the search powers and he drew attention to concerns about the situation in south armagh which i visited not that long ago i think that he is right that people are concerned about security in that area and we have to be conscious of thatthe hon member for north down lady hermon gave quite a long speech i look forward to sitting in committee with her but i hope that her speeches will be slightly shorter than the one that she gave today although she raised some good points she expressed great concern about giving so much discretion to the dpp the hon member for upper bann david simpson raised a number of concerns particularly about the circumstances in which someone could be arrested in northern irelandas my hon friend the member for aylesbury mr lidington said at the outset of the debate we are in principle in broad support of the bill we have a number of concerns which i shall raise in committee and the main one is about the dpps role as regards trials it is an unsatisfactory situation but for reasons of which we are all aware there is trial without jury in northern ireland i question whether it is right for the person responsible for bringing prosecutions to decide the mode of trial i am not convinced that that is the right way forward but again we can consider that in committee it causes me concern that we should still be in the same situation i would be the first to accept that things have moved on but in talking about trial without jury we must acknowledge that there is still a serious problem in northern ireland one of the problems is one of the main political parties lack of support for not only the police but the whole justice system the fact that we are considering the bill and the fact that there continues to be trial without jury underlines the problem of that party not signing up fully to law and orderi was in the province yesterday and the day before that and i had a number of discussions with people including members of sinn fein they made the point that they did not feel that they could get their people fully to support the police unless they were given a date for the devolution of policing and justice all hon members know that under current legislation that cannot happen because the assembly would have to endorse that and until sinn fein gives support to the police a number of political parties particularly the dup will not be happy to sit down in government with sinn fein that is a vicious circle\u2014one party will not sit down with sinn fein until it endorses policing but sinn fein will not endorse policing until it has a date on which policing is to be devolved however that cannot be until the assembly sits as i said to the minister yesterday we need the government to break that circle they should suggest to sinn fein that it ought to support the police and the criminal justice system without any hesitation regardless of any other circumstances", "the hon gentleman makes a very good point support for the police must not be conditional anyone who lives in the united kingdom ought to support the police and the criminal justice system for their own good regardless of whether or not they are in government the government have a difficult task as they have to break that vicious circle the clock is ticking because they have set yet another deadline soon the house will rise for the christmas recess\u2014and i wish every hon member a happy christmas\u2014but the clock will continue to tick in that period as we approach the deadline the constitutional parties in northern ireland quite reasonably want not just words from members of sinn fein but action such as the handing over of evidence to the police when crimes are committed sinn fein should support the police and the criminal justice system in every wayi am concerned about the continuation of trials without jury which are against the principle of law but we have to hold them because of the unusual circumstances in northern ireland that still apply there is violent paramilitary activity and continued criminal activity as we heard the northern ireland affairs committee produced a report on the issue which we debated in great detail only last week we identified several areas where organised criminal activity has increased significantly while that activity continues the full return to normality that we all wish to see in northern ireland cannot take place i give a cautious welcome to the bill and we will not seek to divide the house i shall conclude my brief speech but i warn the minister that i will make longer contributions in committee to see whether we can improve the bill there are concerns about the measure but we accept that basically it takes us in the right direction", "to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland what the average house price is in northern ireland", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what discussions she has had with the government of nigeria on the arrangements which are in place to ensure that the  a forthcoming elections in that country and  b voter registration system to be used

of state for work and pensions what steps he is taking to encourage people to fit carbon monoxide detectors in their homes and if he will make a statement", "the minister used a phrase about changing the mindset of criminals in northern ireland and that is important however england has a similar problem which is partly brought about by the high rate of tax on tobacco alcohol and fuel that is not a criticism of the government because the rate would probably have been the same under a conservative government however the rate encourages people to deal illegally in those products the minister may say that they are bad products which should be taxed heavily however the rate is creating a problem one in four cigarettes in england are brought in illegally so there is a big problem generally the problem is bigger in northern ireland because the money is used to fund terrorism and other illegal activities however as a country must not we reconsider our tax regime on such products", "it is right to say that criminal activity must be stopped the point that my hon friends and i were trying to make however is that there are easy targets for the criminals because tax is so high and so different from the tax on the continent it is a couple of years since i was energy spokesman for my party but i think that petrol in this country starts off as the cheapest in the european union but ends up the dearest after tax that may be slightly out of date information but the position will not have changed much criminals should not be allowed to get away with it\u2014there are easy net gains for them in those areas", "i congratulate the committee on the work that it has done i think that it took six months to compile the report i have not been a member of a select committee for about five years but i well remember that serving on such a committee can be very hard work especially when one is dealing with an issue as sensitive as organised crime in northern ireland with all its security implications i therefore pay tribute to the committee members and in particular to my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack for chairing the committee and for the very competent way in which he made his presentation todaythere is obviously a different atmosphere in northern ireland these days there is hope things have moved on considerably however the report emphasises something that i have been very aware of since i became a spokesman on northern ireland we hear things over here we read reports in the newspapers and we see pictures on television of events in northern ireland that coverage tends to centre these days on the political movements and political discussions but whenever i go over to northern ireland and read the local newspapers i tend to see things that i do not read over here very often more things are going on than perhaps the headlines report in this country i know that we can access the newspapers in northern ireland through the internet but if we go over there read the newspapers and talk to people they tell us of many things going on in the province that perhaps we do not read about in england that unfortunate fact is highlighted in the report which emphasises the fact that there is a continuing big problem with organised crime in the province the fact that the committee had to take evidence in private from witnesses who cannot be named shows how serious the situation remainsalthough we can all be optimistic\u2014the hon member for ealing north stephen pound who is not in his place is an eternal optimist\u2014i sometimes think that we ought to take a more balanced approach to the way in which we address northern ireland issues as ever the hon gentleman spoke entertainingly and i wish that he were here to hear my comments i do not like to make them behind his back as it were but it is not my fault that he is not here i wonder about the wisdom of having on select committees people who although not exactly on the governments payroll are closely attached to them that might water down the independence of a committee i do not mean that in a nasty way towards the hon gentleman for whom i have a great deal of admiration if he comes back into the chamber i shall repeat that the government should consider whether the membership of select committees is as independent as it should bethe hon member for east londonderry mr campbell emphasised the great importance of supporting the police to which i shall return in a moment the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson spoke about the cost to business of the continuing organised crime in northern ireland and very sensibly about the way in which paramilitary groups feed off the chaos that they themselves create that is an old tactic we may look back\u2014the comparison is valid\u2014to the way in which the nazis seized power in germany they fed off chaos we should be aware of that happening in northern irelandmy hon friend the member for southwest norfolk mr fraser gave worrying figures about the level of crime and the difficulty that exists in persuading people to report it i wish to talk about the impact of organised crime on business and therefore on the economy of northern ireland i have the privilege of dealing with statutory instruments that come before the house and i therefore deal with many issues and become conscious of the problems of the northern irish economy yes there is a lot going on that should be welcomed for example around the docks area in belfast but there are an awful lot of problemsthe fiscal deficit\u2014something like \u00a35 billion\u2014is very large for an area of the united kingdom that has only about 17 million people there is overdependence on the public sector for employment which cannot be good although there are encouraging signs it is a big worry that the private sector is not coming on as strongly as it should be and that the level of economic inactivity in northern ireland is far too high i know that the government want to address such issues but the continued organised crime cannot be helping it could be said that for the best part of 40 years terrorism has led to the province being relatively poorer economically than the rest of the uk and we must address thatthe differential tax rates between the north and south are a big problem in connection not only with matters that we have heard about such as fuel and tobacco but with corporation tax it is not a matter that we want to get into too deeply today but it needs to be examined particularly in relation to fuel the report goes into great detail on the matter showing that the situation is getting worse not better there is great intelligence and the police are doing their best so it is worrying that the situation is getting not marginally but a lot worse one begins to wonder how that decline will be stopped and where it will end i am concerned about the ability of the government\u2014any government actually\u2014to improve northern irelands economic prospects and make it more selfsufficient when there is such a degree of organised crimethat is the situation from the economic point of view which is bad enough but i must also ask why all the organised crime is going on in the first place i have always seen the financial profitmaking side of the paramilitary organisations as one of the big problems to be solved organised crime and its proceeds must be financing political activities to some extent i have talked many times in the house about a meeting that i had with the former member of parliament seamus mallon in his constituency three or four years ago before the previous election he said that sinn fein had 200 paid employees working in his area supposedly volunteers that came not from the dup but from a nationalist politician i do not know about my hon friends but i am lucky if i can get 10 people on the streets we have a byelection in tewkesbury today and there will not be 200 people working on it there will be 10 i am sure that the situation is similar throughout the ukhow on earth are sinn feins people paid for i believe that we have the answer which is a worrying one my hon friend the member for southwest norfolk mentioned the northern bank robbery it caused a bit of a hiccup but not as big a hiccup as it should have caused the government said that the ira did it and that members of the ira and sinn fein were one and the same yet they are determined to propel them into government in northern ireland that worries me i want to see progress made as much as anybody and in every statutory instrument committee on which i sit i begin with the words it is a shame that we are all here i wish that the assembly were up and running and carrying out this legislation i stick by that but it worries me that the people who will sit in government are the very people who knew about the northern bank robbery and might even have been involved in committing iteven more worrying is where the money has gone not all of it has been accounted for and it could be used to fight the assembly elections in march it would be amazing if it were not used for that purpose i am sure that some of it will be used for personal gain but some will be put towards fighting the elections that is not only highly illegal and dangerous but very unfair to the political parties in northern ireland including the social democratic and labour party which must fight the election legitimately with small amounts of money we are all well aware of the difficulties of raising money to finance our campaigns and sinn fein might have something of an advantage that cannot be right and it makes it more difficult to solve the problem that there seems to be a dualtrack process there is a political track and a paramilitary financial one it cannot be right for people to be politicians by day and terrorists by night that is not sustainable and the government must somehow find a way to address the problem i am not suggesting that that will be easy but it must be recognised that such problems are going onthat is particularly true because of the prospect of policing and justice being devolved at some stage i know that the minister will talk about the triple lock mechanism but things move on i have spoken to sinn fein mps such as conor murphy who have told me that they are not prepared to sign up to the policing boards until they get that devolution i do not know whether they have changed their minds\u2014things move on and people take different approaches at different times\u2014but he looked me in the eye and said that they were not prepared to do that yet all this organised crime is going onthe report makes it absolutely clear that organised crime is being carried out by people on both sides of the divide the loyalist paramilitaries\u2014i regret the use of that phrase because it is a contradiction in terms but that is the name by which they are recognised\u2014and the republicans i have so far focused on the role of the republicans because they are politically represented and would be sitting in government but for the avoidance of doubt it is important to say that the conservative party totally and utterly condemns paramilitary activity from either sideto say that i welcome the report seems wrong because it contains an awful lot of bad news but it is valuable because it brings to the house the reality of life in northern ireland as i said earlier i am not sure whether everyone in england realises that everything there is not exactly right that includes members of the house who perhaps do not need to spend as much time on northern ireland matters as i do a lot of people say everything is fine there now isnt it to which i reply no its not fine its better but it is not fine there is still a long way to go one great value of the excellent report is that it brings these issues before the house and gives us the opportunity to debate themthe debate has been goodnatured unlike that on the water and sewerage statutory instrument the other day which was somewhat more lively both kinds of debate have a place here in the house i hope that the fact that todays debate has been a lot more civilised means that we can get more out of it i congratulate committee members on all their hard work in producing the report i note that it was unanimous which takes some doing with northern ireland business i congratulate them again on their work and i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry what assessment he has made of the effect of the consumer credit act 1974 on the level of charges made by banks credit card companies and

pupil should represent the beginning of another process not the end of that persons education what advice would he give to three schools in my area cleeve tewkesbury and winchcombe which are getting together to try to deal with all excluded pupils so that they do not miss out on education and do not cause further trouble in society what support particularly financial support is available for arrangements of that kind", "the secretary of state and his ministerial team have often and quite rightly said that decisions about the future of northern ireland should be taken by local politicians from the province indeed they asserted just as much yesterday given that the dup the uup and the sdlp voted against the draft rates amendment northern ireland order 2006 in committee on 25 october how can its introduction be justified against such local opposition", "before i begin i have been asked to pass on the apologies of my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack the chairman of the select committee who made a speech earlier he had to leave for other parliamentary business  interruption he is indeed a great mani have very little time and i do not know which of my various points i wish to make so i shall perhaps start with a very general one i do not know how many statutory instrument committees i have sat on this year it is usually one a week\u2014sometimes two\u2014and we have dealt with very important issues such as rating local government reorganisation and education indeed i understand that a statutory instrument on water will be considered on tuesday with the best will in the world although i travel often to northern ireland i do not represent a constituency there so this strikes me as a very unsatisfactory way of governing the province as i think ministers will agree it is therefore very important that we move towards devolution as quickly as possible but i agree with my friends in the democratic unionist party that it has to be the right devolution settlement if we look across the united kingdom we certainly do not see a uniform or an entirely satisfactory settlement in northern ireland the least that we should hope for is achieving the right settlementthere are concerns about the timetable i understand why things have to be moved on but like other members present i wonder when exactly sinn fein will act on its obligation it will have to be soon in order to give it time to prove to everyone else that it means it but i can see no immediate prospect of that that concerns me because support for the police is absolutely crucial the hon member for thurrock andrew mackinlay was perhaps slightly misinterpreted earlier but i think that he was saying that a british police force represents people whether they are scottish welsh english or from northern ireland", "it is their police force\u2014not ours imposing a judgment on them it is very important that those who seek to control that police force at least support it and recognise its legitimacyin the few seconds left to me i want to echo the desire that was expressed for a return to normal politics in northern ireland having studied the past situation in south africa and rwanda i know that it was important for those countries to move on\u2014to move away from sectarianism unfortunately in northern ireland we have institutionalised it so while there might be good reasons for power sharing at the moment i hope that we can move toward something more like the westminster model\u2014a government and an opposition\u2014rather than everybody being in government or everybody being in opposition the hon member for thurrock said that the playground has to be big enough for everybody to fit into it but in the long term that is not necessarily the best way of going about thingsit is not deadlines that will achieve lasting peace in northern ireland\u2014it is hearts and minds people have to want peace and to be genuine about it and i really hope that we have got to that position i fear that there is a little work left to do before we get there but in general terms i wish the bill well and i hope that we get the chance to explore it in a little

was having a disproportionate effect on the politics in northern ireland we did not seek to end it immediately we put in the fiveyear limit to allow parties to reestablish our concern was not entirely to do with the amount of money or the sources of the money from the republic we were also concerned about money coming from america because there is no doubt that in the past not only has the republic

accidents that no person could have prevented members will know that there are very few strict liability offences under english law\u2014when an instance occurs it is overwhelmingly so that people can mitigate the case against them by showing that they took all reasonable steps to avoid an incident taking placefurther in english criminal law a guilty action amounts to an offence only if the person involved has a guilty mind\u2014in legal speak mens rea\u2014meaning that the person must have had intent to cause the incident or must have been reckless as to its likely occurrence that i am sure is how the house would want the situation to be under both the civil and criminal law the alternative\u2014that one can be held liable for an event about which one knew nothing and indeed that one had taken all reasonable steps to prevent\u2014is a chilling scenario much more suited to the worst totalitarian states than to democracieson 12 april 2006 the court of appeal held that absolute offences which may subject a person to conviction and punishment in circumstances where he had done nothing wrong may well be an infringement of his human rights yet there are one or two provisions in english law that can lead to that very situation and it is one of those that my bill seeks to address today it exists in section 2 of the animals act 1971the wording of the act as might be expected is a little tortuous and unclear but it seems to suggest that the owner of an animal is always liable for damages if that animal is involved in an accident regardless of the steps taken to avoid such an accident happening although the act is somewhat ambiguous to a layman it was interpreted in the house of lords to mean precisely that\u2014that someone can be held liable in all such cases in the case of mirvahedy  v henley in march 2003 the house of lords held the defendants liable for damages for injuries caused to a motorist hossein mirvahedy in an accident after their horse had escaped from a fieldi do not for one moment make light of the serious injuries sustained by mr mirvahedy who was a blameless individual whose misfortune it was to be involved in the accident nor do i say that in all circumstances animal owners should be relieved of all responsibility for their animals\u2014not at all as there may well be cases where they are liable\u2014but i do question how any reasonable person could attach blame to mr and mrs henley when they had taken all reasonable steps to avoid such an incident occurringif that iniquity is not removed the knockon effect could be considerable for example given the new right to roam would farmers be responsible for any accident that resulted from one of their sheep escaping on to a road if a rambler had crossed the farmers field and left a gate open following the house of lords ruling presumably they would be held responsible yet that would be manifestly unfair what exactly is the farmer expected to do in those circumstanceslet us take the case of riding schools which are a source of much enjoyment to people of all ages especially children if a horse escapes from a secure field which horses do and causes an accident is the owner to be liable for damages even though there are no steps that he could reasonably have been expected to take to avoid such an occurrence if a horse bolts when startled by a loud and sudden noise close to it is the owner of the animal equally held liable for any damage again apparently yes the owner of the horse would following the house of lords ruling be liable we could then reach the situation where riding schools close down which benefits nobody unless they can afford the increasingly expensive insurance polices that would cover them against such damage\u2014policies that will surely become even more expensive following the ruling we could reach a situation whereby farmers who are struggling financially in any case decide that it simply is not worth it any more where would we be thensurely the best way to avoid those undesirable outcomes is to amend the animals act in that respect which is what i seek to do i should therefore like to insert a new clause into the act which statesit shall be a defence to any action brought under this act for the keeper of the animal to show that he took all reasonable care in the circumstances to avoid any accident or incident occurring or damage being caused to a third party or their propertyi am hopeful of making some progress because the government are sympathetic to what i am saying i tabled a parliamentary question in april and the response from the minister was as followsthe animals act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances this appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allow for a general defence of reasonable care the government have acknowledged that there may be a case for an amendment to the animals act and expects to launch a consultation shortly\u2014 official report 25 april 2006 vol 445 c971wi am not sure whether that consultation has yet been launched but the law certainly needs amending sooner rather than later and i am pleased that the government have acknowledged thatthe bill has support from members of four political parties and i am grateful to conservative labour liberal democrat and democratic unionist members for their enthusiastic support they realise that the present situation represents an anomaly in the law i am also grateful to the british horse society for its supporti repeat that i have the utmost sympathy for anyone involved in an accident caused by an animal and i accept that animal owners have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to avoid such accidents however the fact that someone has taken all reasonable steps to avoid such incidents should be a defence in law against litigation and it is that balance in the law that the bill seeks to strike i commend it to the house question put and agreed tobill ordered to be brought in by mr laurence robertson mr mark todd mr peter atkinson philip davies mr nigel evans mr richard benyon kate

congratulate the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson on securing this debate and on the typically passionate and eloquent way in which he spoke policing in northern ireland is obviously a subject close to his heart as it is close to my heart and those of many in northern ireland i do not intend to speak for long as i want to give the minister a chance to answer the many points that have been raised but i entirely endorse the points that the hon gentleman made about the requirement for sinn fein to support the policea few weeks ago i and the shadow secretary of state for northern ireland my hon friend the member for aylesbury mr lidington sat in front of mr adams and mr mcguiness and made that very point mr adams responded by saying that he was not sure that he could take his community along with him if that is the case i really do not know where we go from there how can we have someone sitting in government who not only does not support the police but does not recognise their legitimacy the reason those in sinn fein do not recognise the legitimacy of the police is that they do not recognise the legitimacy of the british government\u2014as they refer to them\u2014in northern ireland sinn fein does not even call northern ireland northern ireland it calls it the north of ireland and talks about the british government as if they were nothing to do with them at alli hope that we can get the assembly kickstarted again because this afternoon this place will have to deal with yet another statutory instrument which covers a number of issues we shall have to take all of it or leave all of it\u2014we cannot amend any of it\u2014yet most of us on the committee do not even live in northern irelandi hope that the assembly can get up and running again but is it fair to ask my hon friends in the democratic unionist party to sit alongside people who have committed dreadful crimes in the past people can repent and move on but moving on is the requirement and that means that people should accept the legitimacy of the government and the police and do everything that they can to support them as my hon friend the member for east antrim said that does not just mean joining police boards\u2014we can all go and join a club tomorrow\u2014but going with hearts and minds until the hearts and minds are right we will not get the assembly up and running and we will not make progressi mention my hon friends in the democratic unionist party but on monday and tuesday i was in belfast for meetings with all the political parties apart from sinn fein it is not that i do meet sinn fein\u2014i do\u2014but it was not possible on that occasion i spoke to the leader of the ulster unionist party who said that he very much hoped to get things up and running i asked well would you go into government with sinn fein with the situation as it today his response was i think id want to see some movement on policing first so it is not just my hon friends in the democratic unionist party who say that all legitimate parties recognise that there must be some movement\u2014the hon member for foyle mark durkan came at the issue from a different angle but he has also been concerned about the situation for a long timeon my previous visit to northern ireland i went to south armagh and spoke to the police there who are very concerned about the proposed reduction in the army numbers they told me that their police officers cannot even go into shops in the area and be served and that the mp for the area will not even speak to them never mind support them or encourage his people to go to them if they have witnessed a crime is he to sit in the government in my judgment it would be difficult for him to do sowhen i went past magenniss bar on monday i was reminded of the iras continued activity at the very time when it was negotiating to sit in government 18 or so months ago it was planning the northern bank robbery the money from which has not been fully recovered there was the dreadful murder in magenniss bar which the ira cleaned up to hide the evidence rather than taking it to the police and there was the dreadful gang rape of a young girl shortly after that was evidence taken to the police no an attempt was made to clean up the scene although i share the desire for the assembly to be up and running again for the reasons that i have given the more often i visit northern ireland the more i am convinced that sinn feinira have to support the police in their hearts and mindssomething odd about going over to northern ireland regularly is that one reads the local newspapers which one does not much see in this country they report much that is not reported over here which is significant it is easy for members to sit in this chamber and say oh they should join the assembly and sit in government\u2014they should give it a go but it is very different over there and much more difficult than we perceive to say such thingsi entirely endorse everything that my hon friend the member for east antrim and other hon members have said i congratulate the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik on making a robust speech as well as my hon

turned down that would have funded very important sports facilities in an area in which some 10000 people live and which lacks such facilities that extremely important project is a community

achieve a monthbymonth balance towards the end of this year or do they have to have a fullyear balance including the historic deficits if the secretary of state could answer that one question it would

they have to pay the money back it causes considerable hardship i recently wrote to her about a case in which the claimant had put her income down on the claim form but not in the specific box required she subsequently confirmed that that was her income but was then overpaid because the inland revenue was unable to take account of what she had reported to them she is now faced with a bill

by 15 per cent for example that should be done anyway we should not have to get to this crisis point people will not accept that these changes are being made for the right reasons because they read in the press that the nhs has severe financial problems and is cutting not planning the problem is that local health chiefs are not planning the current situation is a reaction to their being told by the strategic health authorities that this year they have to balance all the books or else the minister is right to say that we have to move services on\u2014i have no objection to that", " rose\u2014", "i think the hon member for stroud mr drew made the point that i intended to make but i will say this i am grateful to the minister for her sympathetic approach and i think we all accept that the organisations should be in monthly balance by the end of this financial year that is a sensible requirement to which we have never objected we should like to know however whether the requirement for everything to balance\u2014including historic deficits\u2014relates to this financial year could it be extended to for example three years that would make all the difference i realise that the subject is hugely complicated but perhaps the minister could focus on that when she returns to it", "the hon gentleman makes some powerful points does he agree that there is a further problem albeit a shortterm one given that the pcts are going to be changed this year there could be redundancy payments and extra pension payments i accept that that will be a oneoff cost but it will make balancing the books even more difficult is it not only reasonable that the trusts should be a given a little bit of time to balance the books", "i rather regret the need for this debate but having said that i am pleased to have secured it and thank the minister for attending i want to set out the picture regarding health services in gloucestershire and seek clarification from the minister on a number of issuesthere are three primary care trusts in gloucestershire and one hospital trust cheltenham and tewkesbury primary care trust which covers most but not all of my constituency is in surplus but other trusts have been in deficit the result is that across the county there are some \u00a340 millionworth of deficits all the trusts together are proposing cuts in health services amounting to some \u00a330 million as things standthere is of course great opposition in gloucestershire to this proposal i have a petition with more than 2200 names on it which i hope to present to the house in the next few days that constitutes a high percentage of the population affected indeed there have been rallies and marches across gloucestershire my hon friend the member for forest of dean mr harper who cannot be here tonight initiated a debate in the chamber on 25 may and he has been very active in opposing the cuts indeed there is united opposition to them throughout the house members from the conservative and liberal democrat parties and from the government party will seek to catch your eye to contribute to the debate mr deputy speaker and it might be helpful if i confirm that they have approached me to ask for permission to do soi should say at the outset that we of course have no disagreement with organisations balancing their books every organisation must do that also no one is going to accuse the government of having cut spending on the health service as that is not the case so i hope that the minister will not defend the government against charges that i am not going to makei turn first to my main particular and most immediate concern\u2014i shall come on to others shortly\u2014which is the proposal to close winchcombe hospital it was built in 1928 with a lot of the funding provided by local people and benefactors it provides a caring and comfortable convalescence for people especially older people recovering from operations or other treatment it also provides a very helpful minor injuries unit in a rural area where public transport is not particularly usefulthe white paper on community hospitals issued some while ago made it clear that community hospitals should not closein response to shortterm budgetary pressuressensibly it recognised the value of and need for such hospitals\u2014as indeed do i i was recently treated at tewkesbury community hospital within five minutes of having had a rather nasty car accident the staff were excellent and i pay tribute to them and place on the record my thanks to them the alternative to that treatment would have been a long car journey and delayed treatment thereby putting additional pressure on staff at say cheltenham or gloucester hospital so although the white paper opposes such closures that is exactly what is being proposed in gloucestershirepeople in winchcombe are united in total opposition to the proposed closure of their hospital they value it and they need its services if it closes they too will have to go to cheltenham or gloucester for immediate treatment and those who are currently being treated or operated on in one of those hospitals will presumably have to be sent home early if winchcombe hospital closesi acknowledge that there is a debate going on about how long people should stay in hospital and i accept that nowadays some people can go home earlier than they might have done in the past often home is the best place for people to recover but not always a while ago my daughter was sent home from hospital after a major operation the very next day even though she had no one to look after her and had two children to look after herself that is unacceptable these days but if we close hospitals and reduce bed numbers it will become common practice which i would greatly regrethave the people who make these decisions considered the knockon costs\u2014to social services for example have they calculated when people need help at home in the light of meetings that i and others have had with gloucestershire county council which would have to provide many such services it appears that those knockon services have not been costed according to the local primary care trust they have not been costed its director of finance said today when asked about the future alternative proposalswe have not calculated detailed costs yethow does it know that the books will balance even after the cuts have been made if those cuts have not been thoroughly thought through or properly costed what that director did confirm was that closing the hospital will save only an estimated \u00a3240000 a year how can that be right how can that make financial let alone clinical sensei am also concerned by the lack of joinedup thinking about the knockon costs and generally for example just recently the doctors surgery in winchcombe closed and it was proposed that another one be built outside the centre why was no consideration given to moving the surgery to the hospital and expanding the services available there instead of cutting them the surgery would have remained in the centre of the town where many old people live and there would have been no need to build another oneif the hospital is not needed why are local health chiefs considering buying in several beds for the very purpose of convalescence we already have 22 beds at winchcombe hospital so why lose them and buy in beds from elsewhere i totally oppose the proposal to close the hospital but other cuts across the county also worry mefor example delancey hospital which is just outside my constituency and in that of my hon friend the member for cotswold mr cliftonbrown is also proposed for closure but it provides a good service st pauls maternity wing in cheltenham general hospital was opened just 10 years ago at a cost of \u00a36 million and that is proposed for closure the overnight facilities at battledown childrens ward also in cheltenham hospital will be closed and other hospitals in neighbouring constituencies are closing mental health units are being proposed for closure and further cuts are being considered but are not confirmed yetall that represents shortterm thinking where will it end the proposed closure of those and other services is extremely worrying why are we having those cuts at all and whose fault are they people are taking a stand not only because of the present proposals but the further ones that they fear we are not a third world country\u2014we are supposed to be the fourth largest economy in the world\u2014so why do we face those cuts are we not entitled to expect enhanced more efficient health services not just services cobbled together to match the particular budgetary pressures at the timeon 6 april 2005 the prime minister said from the dispatch boxit is correct that we raised national insurance to pay for extra investment in the national health service\u2014 official report 6 april 2005 vol 432 c 1409my constituents have paid the extra tax but where is the money going all they are seeing is cuts yes they are getting vague promises from local health chiefs about better provision being on the way and that health care will be provided in a different way in future well we will believe it when we see it if there is a better way to treat patients why was not that way pursued before why does it take budgetary pressure to force decisionmakers to follow the correct clinical pathwho is to blame it is an interesting question no doubt the government have increased funding but have they increased their requirements from trusts to the extent that the extra money has been swallowed up in extra costs or have the local health chiefs mismanaged the extra expenditure i would like the minister to give me her view of gloucestershire because i do not necessarily blame the government i want to explore tonight exactly where the fault lies who is to blame for the deficits what is the ministers view how do we sort the deficits out it could be done by closing frontline services and making patients suffer but it could also be done more sensibly given a little more timethe question that i would most like the minister to answer\u2014it is a crucial question that has been raised before\u2014is about the balancing of the budget the local trusts claim that they have to balance their books for the whole of this financial year including making up historic deficits within this financial year i quote from their consultation document published just todaypcts have to achieve inyear balance and recover 20056 deficitsthey say that they have been told unequivocally that they have to do that they told hon members that that was the case just last friday however the secretary of state in a letter to my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire mr lansley said that trusts would be expected to make improvements this year and achieve monthbymonth balance by the end of the financial year that is quite a different thingin a statement last week the secretary of state said againwe are aiming for all organisations with deficits to reach monthly balance of income and expenditure by the beginning of april next yearshe went on to say that in some cases the worst ones will be allowed even more leniency who is right do the trusts have to achieve total balance for the year including historic deficits or do they have to achieve monthly balance by the end of this year because if the secretary of state is right the consultation paper in gloucestershire has been launched on a false even dishonest premise", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman and i know that he shares my concerns he makes the point well the strategic health authority is in touch with the primary care trust and providing instructions\u2014i nearly said guidance\u2014but we do not know whether they are correct if we go by what the secretary of state says\u2014and that is in writing\u2014the shas interpretation is wide of the mark i hope that the minister will clarify the situation i reiterate that the trusts should balance their books but how long have they been given to do it if it can be done over a slightly longer period the cuts might not be necessaryi wish to make a further point about topslicing the pct covering most of my area in cheltenham and tewkesbury was actually in surplus last year however it is cutting frontline services to help to balance the books of others that it seems is the penalty for achieving better financial management as if that were not bad enough the government are forcing the gloucestershire trusts to bail out the others under the same sha to tune of more than \u00a36 millionin her statement last week the secretary of state said thatthat money will not be lost to those communities it will be repaid normally in the threeyear allocations periodhowever she went on to sayi have stressed to the health authorities that the areas with the greatest health needs should be repaid first\u2014 official report 7 june 2006 vol 447 c 254so gloucestershire will actually lose that money and if the hospitals are closed anyway they are not likely to reopen within that threeyear period", "indeed this becomes more complicated because the three trusts are merging into one i am not making a point about one area against another and west gloucestershire makes up a large part of my constituency however it does appear that good financial management is being penalised by that topslicingin fact gloucestershire loses out in the first place when it comes to funding we receive only 88 per cent of national average funding that is supposed to be because we are healthier but\u2014as local health chiefs point out\u2014healthy people live longer and older people cost the nhs even more money so where is the joinedup thinking in that particular philosophy where is the joinedup thinking about the nhs generallyto follow up the point made by the hon member for cheltenham martin horwood i should explain that when i was elected in 1997 there was one gloucestershire health authority at present there are three pcts but there is a proposal to revert to one in other words we are to go back to exactly where we were nine years ago except that there is now another tier of bureaucracy\u2014the pointless strategic health authority which costs more than \u00a35 million a year to run even that is being tinkered with because it will cover a different area the situation is ridiculous a number of pcts and hospital trusts under a single sha are making farreaching decisions those pcts will not exist come october and the sha will not exist in its present form by the end of the summer yet massive cuts are being planned by people who probably will not be in post to carry them out\u2014or to carry the can for themi referred earlier to the consultation document published by the health chiefs today they wanted a consultation period of only five weeks but members and some members of gloucestershire county council managed to exert enough pressure to get the deadline extended to 12 weeks that is still not a long time but farcically it takes us to the point when the people making the proposals might all be seeking alternative employment at the end of the consultation period none of them might be in post such is the nonsense of the situationas well as containing dubious phrases such as the one i quoted earlier the document insults the intelligence of the people of gloucestershire among other motherhood and apple pie questions it asksdo you think that helping people to stay fit and well is an important principlefor goodness sake what kind of smokescreen what kind of sham is this public consultation exercise will the people be listened to or will their views be ignored as they normally arethere is an unhappy situation in gloucestershire we are paying more tax to fund the nhs yet we are losing our hospitals the government are piling billions of pounds into the nhs yet a quarter of the countrys pcts are in deficit local health chiefs say that they have to balance the books within the current financial year yet the government say that they have to achieve a monthly balance the government claim that they are reforming the nhs but in truth they are merely tinkering with its structures the net result is that the people of gloucestershire especially older people children poorer people the pregnant and the mentally ill\u2014in other words the vulnerable\u2014all lose outas i said at the beginning of the debate i do not seek to blame the government i am trying to bring home to the minister the strength of opposition in gloucestershire to the proposals being made across the county will she clarify exactly what she is asking trusts to achieve financially this

a statement on progress made on the eu constitution", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry whether there are plans to introduce eu legislation which would prevent the use of certain

introduced it and took it through committee it has been possible to explore it in great detail and he was always willing to take interventions it does credit to the house that we have analysed it in that way in particular on the floor of the house which has been useful in partwe have some concerns we were worried about abolishing the annual canvass and tried to put a time scale on that so that there would be canvasses in 2015 at the latest and every 10 years after that we were also a little concerned about the ability of the chief electoral officer working with the secretary of state to cancel those canvasses but we are where we are and we recognise the need to modernise the system the important thing is that we have a full register of electors in northern irelandwe were a bit concerned about the donations for political purposes although we did not touch on that greatly we would have liked a time limit on donations from the republic of ireland but the government turned that down i regret that we tabled an amendment to address that but sadly we did not reach it because of the lack of time however those donations remain a concern for obvious reasonsthe biggest issue covered by the bill is the devolution of policing and justice although we have no objection to that in principle we have discussed it at length and are worried that responsibility for it could fall into the wrong hands i recognise that we have the doubledouble lock the treble lock or the quadruple lock\u2014or whatever it is\u2014and that the assembly does not have to accept responsibility for policing and justice however whether or not policing and justice are devolved the points raised in connection with that are extremely importanti spoke about my experiences in south armagh but did not get a chance to expand on those because of the 6 oclock deadline when i visited it last week\u2014i was pleased that the northern ireland affairs committee also visited it last week and that the chairman confirmed that my experiences were his\u2014it was stressed that there had been a huge improvement in the area however it can by no means be considered normal when the police cannot go out on their own that is not acceptable in any part of the united kingdom whether certain people in that area like it or not it is part of the united kingdom one of the most alarming things was that the police told me that the mp for that area would not engage with them that is unacceptable especially when that person is a member of the assembly could become a minister and could become the minister with responsibility for the police however at this point that person will not engage with them moving on from that we wanted to try to make it a little more secure that people holding office in northern ireland actually supported the rule of lawthe hon member for east antrim sammy wilson mentioned that when he did a television programme and asked a sinn fein supporter whether they would report a crime he gave as an example the crime of rape if someone had such knowledge and did not report it they would not be upholding the rule of law it is not acceptable for such a person to sit in government it is unfortunate that the minister did not accept our amendments in that respect we pressed them to the vote and did not win but we made the point it was not a watertight measure but it would have moved the situation in the right directionagain we have not discussed the electricity market in great detail on the floor of the house although we discussed it upstairs my understanding\u2014this is not a criticism it has been a good start\u2014is that the bill does not create the wholesale electricity market as it is headlined in the bill according to the discussions i have had with the authorities in northern ireland it will provide the ability to coordinate the regulation of the market in northern ireland with the regulation of the market in the republic of ireland that may be a useful step but in order for consumers in northern ireland to get the full benefit of that they need to go further and to have a true market covering the whole of ireland and indeed possibly the whole of ireland and the united kingdom a bigger market especially if they can move towards a freer market will lead to lower electricity pricesi welcome the possibility of financial assistance for energy purposes which is in clause 23 especially renewable energy it is important that we develop renewable energy first because it is renewable and helps to reduce emissions of poisonous gases and secondly because it would provide security of supply we have seen throughout the world a rather unsettled market in primary sources of energy if we look at what is happening in certain areas of south america and at the behaviour of russia on one or two occasions it is clear that we need a more secure energy supply in this countryi pay tribute to the answer that the prime minister gave during prime ministers questions today he gave a balanced and positive view of energy policy i hope that he has the courage to pursue that policy against the opposition of certain members of his own party it is important that he does so i give a word of warning on clause 23 in great britain we have not developed renewable energy as well as we should it still provides a very small percentage of the electricity that we use if we are going to pursue that in northern ireland we need to do more not only on energy conservation but on the development of renewable energy it is not being developed in this country quickly enough i hope that we can use the bill to study why that has not been the case and to move on renewable energy a little more quickly in northern ireland than we have in great britaini have made just a few observations perhaps other hon members want to contribute by and large we welcome the bill there are not many of my colleagues here tonight but they have contributed a great deal in committee particularly the chairman of the select committee i thank them for their help and support during the passage of the bill", "the minister will be aware that the word most often used in law is reasonable it is not possible to define exactly what that means", "given the fact that we have to finish this debate in less than a minute i do not have time to go through the various arguments that have been made the new clause is not watertight but no legislation is however as the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson said it would be a significant move in the right direction if we were to adopt it i therefore have no option but to press the new clause to a vote", "i beg to move that the clause be read a second time", "i add my welcome to the minister i hope he finds his time in the northern ireland office fulfilling i know that he will find it challenging and interesting i look forward to working with himnew clauses 7 and 8 revisit topics that we discussed in a slightly different context during earlier stages of the bill they refer to the requirement that ministers in office uphold the rule of law and that before they are appointed to office they make a declaration before the assembly pledging to uphold the rule of law the new clauses add to sections 30 and 18 of the 1998 act and the pledge of officeon earlier amendments we debated support for the rule of law and for the police so i do not intend to speak for too long but as i did not take part in that debate i hope i shall be allowed a few minutes to express my opinions as has been said by various members we cannot allow a situation in northern ireland where ministers are in control of the police yet do not support the police we cannot accept that situation or move towards itlast week i visited south armagh the people there the army and the police were clear that the situation had improved immeasurably and i accept that it has however it may be useful to the house especially to members who may not visit northern ireland regularly if i describe the situation there the army still accompanies the police when they go around south armagh particularly in crossmaglen the police are often refused service in shops they are concerned about what will happen as the army pulls out of the area criminality is continuing and in the words of the people in the area there is a long long way to go before normality is reachedgiven that background it is reasonable that we should ask any minister who has the potential to be in control of the police and of the other offices of northern ireland as well to make a declaration before the assembly pledging to uphold the rule of law i do not see that there can be any objection to that requirement other than one there may be a party\u2014sinn fein\u2014that would object to that requirement if we allow that party to get in the way of writing the requirement into the bill what does that say about the entire processwe feel strongly about new clauses 7 and 8 yes there is a requirement in the bill to pursue nonviolent and democratic means but the bill like the 1998 act should require the additional declaration before the assembly pledging to uphold the rule of law if that were the requirement the constitutional and legitimate parties in northern ireland would find it much easier to move towards the full restoration of the northern ireland assembly", "i shall speak to amendments nos 17 to 20 aspects of which we discussed at earlier stagesaccuracy of the register is extremely important we expressed concerns about the abolition of the annual canvass in previous debates today we are discussing the same thing in a different way we were concerned about the secretary of states ability to override the chief electoral officer and indeed the legislation we are now looking at the matter slightly differently our amendments would ensure that a canvass took place in 2015 and every 10 years thereafter so that even if one canvass was delayed others would be carried out in those yearswe were a little concerned about the abolition of the annual canvass but having discussed it with the former ceo we understood some of the reasons he felt that it would be better if he could deploy his resources on encouraging people to register rather than carrying out an annual canvass i can appreciate both sides of the argument but i am concerned that the secretary of state could say that a canvass should never be carried out it is important to hold a canvass every so often as people move or slip through the neti commend our amendments they are innocuous and i am sure that the government will see them in that way i look forward to the ministers response", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills when she will make a decision on the application by churchdown school gloucester for permission to dispose of school playing fields and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills pursuant to the answer of 7 march 2006  official report columns 148384w to the hon member for peterborough on teachers pay what progress has been made in consideration of the issues arising from the consultation on enabling teachers to access taxbeneficial schemes", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what estimate he has made of the potential cost to the treasury of

in developing countries and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for health what plans she has to amend the arrangements for the regulation of osteopaths and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department what his policy is on granting asylum to refugees from darfur and if he will make a statement", "it would do conservative members no good to deny the significant progress in the imc report but it does the government no good to quote selectively which the minister has done again i shall give him the sentence immediately before his final quotewe also believe that in a separate incident pira itself may have been associated with the forced departure of somebody from the area where he livedthat is the second of two quotes in paragraph 215 about continued expulsions by the ira as the minister knows other parts of the imc report mention senior members of the ira who are involved in criminality it does not do either side any good to quote selectively", "i would like to contribute briefly to the debate on amendments nos 10 and 14 in particular i can see the benefit of having an enddate in place it does tend to concentrate the mind however as the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik said yesterday quite correctly we have seen so many deadlines come and go in northern ireland i suppose i have to question whether there can be any confidence in the idea that this is a real deadline i understand fully and take completely at face value the assurances that the secretary of state gave yesterday that it is a deadline but there are ways of setting further deadlines and still retaining this one things can be fudged in one way or anotheri also take the point made yesterday by my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack who has been present for virtually all the debate\u2014he has just left his place for a moment if we get to say 20 november and we are almost there but not quite is it right to let the whole thing fall that is a powerful point although i can see the point of a deadline i think that on balance the argument put forward by the hon member for belfast north mr dodds carries a lot of weight and we will therefore support the democratic unionist party if the matter is pressed to a voteamendment no 14 is difficult to disagree with the government have set so much store by what the imc is saying", "the hon gentleman was rather scathing about deadlines himself yesterday i have every respect for this parliament\u2014i am sure that hon members share that view i have come into the chamber\u2014in the case not only of this bill but the previous bill relating to northern ireland\u2014undecided on how to vote on a number of issues and i have listened to the arguments parliament is at its best when hon members do that and are not necessarily whipped into one line or another interruption the minister is laughing but i make no apology for listening to the debate which i am sure that he does regularly i am not entirely convinced that we are right to support the dup on amendment no 10 but having listened to the arguments made by the hon members for montgomeryshire and for belfast north mr dodds we will on balance do so", "the hon gentleman asks me to speculate about what we would do in government it is not that far off so we will have to face up to those questions but we are not quite there yet i want to move on from this point because there are other things to discuss but i will not dodge the hon gentlemans question if he is asking whether no deadline is better than a deadline that is all over the place i would suggest that it probably is", "i am persuaded by the hon gentlemans eloquence he made the important point earlier that if we were almost to reach the deadline surely it would be better to let the assembly to continue to run for a while\u2014at least we would have something\u2014than to get rid of everything that could lead to full devolution more quickly than would otherwise be the case so on balance we will support the dup if the amendment is pressed to a divisionthe government set a good deal of store by what the imc says and i understand why the secretary of state quoted from the report extensively yesterday i would be surprised if the government opposed amendment no 14 i accept that the imc cannot dictate what we do in the house because that is up to hon members however i also accept that there are worries among the unionist parties and probably the sdlp about going into government with people who have not fully given up violence it does no one on the unionist side including me any good to pretend that there was no good news in yesterdays report\u2014no one has suggested that\u2014but it does the government no good to pretend that the whole report represented a clean bill of health i quoted at length yesterday the parts of the report that said that senior members of the ira were still involved in criminality and cited specific expulsions that were still being carried out by the ira that was all in the report as well as the good news so if we are to accept the imc report we must accept the whole report i thus have a lot of sympathy with amendment no 14 too", "i will be brief because we have had a long debate on the amendments probably because they are wide ranging i do not especially want to join in the debate on what the name for the new assembly should be there is a little confusion about what the bill does and it has sometimes been difficult to explain that to people who have responded by saying oh so youre setting up a shadow assembly and i have replied that it is not quite like that although the situation is difficult i do not want to take up the committees time on that issueas other hon members said it is important that the assembly deals with real issues that will be an incentive to make it work so that the real assembly\u2014or the northern ireland assembly as i should call it\u2014can be set up and full devolution can be realised if it ends up as a talking shop which i very much hope it will not we will not have served the cause of devolution welli endorse everything that my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack said in particular it is important that we put on hold as many statutory instruments as possible until the assembly is up and running and fully able to consider those matters we recently considered water rates and local government and we are about to consider education those are big issues i do not want to get to the point in november or i hope before then when devolution is fully triggered to find that the assembly is landed with a load of legislation of which it does not approve that would not be a helpful starti appeal to the secretary of state to allow the assembly to have something left to do that is important however it is wrong for this house to decide such important matters for the 17 million people who live in northern ireland i do my best from the dispatch box and in committee but i do not have and do not pretend to have the knowledge that hon members from northern ireland have we all do our best but we cannot have the same expertise as they haveon privilege in the assembly again i am not a lawyer but i would find it odd if the word malice remains as a qualification in paragraph 6 of schedule 1 i realise that malice is an important factor in the law on murder for example but we are talking about a very different matter when it comes to defamation to prove that someone said something with malice would be very difficult i do not think that it should remain in the paragraphwe would have preferred the assembly to elect the presiding officer for the reason given by the hon member for belfast east mr robinson he or she would command greater authority and it would also be fairer for the assembly and the people who serve in that officeon the secretary of states powers to set the proceedings of the assembly it would have been useful for the bill to include after consultation with the presiding officer that might have been better but probably only if the presiding officer had been elected by the assembly rather than appointed by the secretary of state to avoid an incestuous relationshipwe have some concern about the fact that the secretary of state is taking on extra powers we seem to be considering so much legislation some of it is definitive but then we come to a clause that says the secretary of state can do this that and the other and think why bother sitting through all the deliberations if he can do that i am fearful of that because it is wrong to vest so much power in any one person i have no objection to this particular secretary of state but it would lead to more statutory instruments which we all want to avoid he should think about the powers that he is taking and whether they are going to lead to more statutory instruments i think we would agree that that would not be a good thing however it is a temporary measure and we do not intend to divide the committee on itwe wish the bill well and look forward to hearing what the secretary of state has to say in reply to a number of good points raised", "we have had an extremely interesting debate on yet another northern ireland bill which was yet again introduced in reasonable tones by the secretary of state who if i may be permitted to say so made a number of telling and important points my hon friend the member for aylesbury mr lidington set out clearly and movingly our views and difficulties but also our hopes for this bills capacity to achieve devolution and a peaceful future for northern ireland those are my views as well i have never made any secret of the fact that eight years ago i voted against a number of aspects of the belfast agreement but one of the things that i was enthusiastic about was devolution i remain hopeful that we can set up the assembly againwe have heard a number of contributions from right hon and hon members which i shall run through fairly quickly the right hon member for torfaen mr   murphy feels that it would be disastrous if the process did not succeed he said that he felt very uncomfortable as a direct rule minister when i work on the many statutory instruments\u2014as i do seemingly almost every day at the moment\u2014i too feel uncomfortable so i well understand what he feels and means i share his hopes for the assemblythe hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik who serves on most if not all of those committees with me wondered whether this years assembly would be able to change some of the decisions made by order of the secretary of state so perhaps the minister will respond to that point he also made the good point that the shifting of deadlines in the past is perhaps not helpful now and i am sure that the government will take that on board he also made an important point about what will happen if the assembly does not get up and running and full devolution is not restored\u2014i hope very much that it will be restored although i know that the government have taken steps to address the situation we cannot go on governing northern ireland as we are doing i hope that we can move forward through devolution and the assembly but if that is not possible we need to redouble our efforts to find a better way of governing the provincethe hon member for foyle mark durkan regrets that the bill does not go further and opposes giving the secretary of state the power to delay the elections from 2007 to 2008 as i indicated in an intervention on the hon member for north down lady hermon i am concerned about that measure and have tabled an amendment that will give us the opportunity to discuss it tomorrow i understand that the government are saying that if the assembly is not up and running until november we may not want to disrupt things so quickly that is a rather pessimistic view because the assembly may be up and running again by may\u2014we all hope that it will be\u2014in which case elections in 2007 would not come too quickly however we can explore that matter in a bit more detail tomorrowi welcome the enthusiasm for the bill of the right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley in his typically robust speech it is important to note that he paid tribute to the members of the legislative assembly and the work that they have done he correctly pointed out that it was not the democratic constitutional parties that needed to change but the irathe hon member for blaydon mr anderson said that he was probably the only person in the house other than those from northern ireland who had had a mandate from northern ireland he has recently served on many northern ireland committeesmy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee sensibly called for there to be no more unnecessary statutory instruments before the assembly is up and running he also expressed worry about setting deadlines and said that this particular deadline should perhaps be the end of the year the hon member for ogmore huw irrancadavies talked about trust and having a vision for the futurethe hon member for belfast east mr robinson made the important point that there should be no joint sovereignty if things fail by 24 november i know that the secretary of state has tried to play down several reports on the comments that he is supposed to have made but i was in america at the time and heard reports about those comments the secretary of state suggested in his statement to the house last week that even if the assembly is not up and running by 24 november there should be a strengthening of crossborder bodies i would be worried if we had the one without the otherthe hon member for hackney south and shoreditch meg hillier said how important it was for northern ireland to have an assembly and made a comparison with london and the london mayor i am not sure that i approve of the analogy but think that i know what was she was getting at the hon member for east londonderry mr campbell made the good and important point that sinn fein needs to change its mode of behaviour to enable any support for the police to be crediblei apologise that unfortunately i missed the speech by the hon member for south down mr mcgrady because i had to slip out of the chamber for a few moments i understand that he gave strong support to the good friday agreement and said that there was a need to preserve iti have already touched on the speech made by the hon member for north down she objected to the postponement of the scheduled elections and to the fact that the bill gives the secretary of state more power a consistent theme of several recent bills has been the inclusion of a clause that allows the secretary of state to change many things i share the hon ladys concern but perhaps we can discuss that in more detail in committee tomorrowthe hon member for strangford mrs robinson made a good point which i endorse that it is not the dup that needs to change but the people who are in the way of democratic government in northern ireland the hon member for belfast north mr dodds wants the government to respond to the views expressed by the elected representatives of northern ireland that is    extremely important given the significance of legislation that has recently been passed by order last week for example the number of councils was reduced from 26 to seven with the support of sinn fein alone among the political parties if the assembly once it is up and running does not find that acceptable i hope that the secretary of state will take note of its opinionthe hon member for south antrim dr mccrea rightly said that the institutions must be based on democracy and that the assembly must be built on rock not sand that is a very important statement to make the hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson said that in future he does not want any family to suffer what families have previously suffered everyone in the house should share that objective he expressed a determination to make the process work i have known him for many years not only as a political colleague but as a close friend and i know that that is the case the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson called for a sustainable assembly not one that is likely to falter the hon member for upper bann david simpson spoke about the difficulty of having to work with someone who authorised the assassination of four members of his family it is hard for me to appreciate how difficult that is but i admire his courage and determination to do so to make the process workas i said at the outset i have served on many delegated legislation and northern ireland bill committees almost every day this week and last week i attended such committees goodness knows what will happen when we return next week but there is a delegated legislation committee the tuesday after bank holiday monday that is a most unsatisfactory way of deciding policies and legislation for northern ireland when the assembly is up and running it must be allowed to discuss those important issues it must be worth while or it will falter which is not what i want and i do not think it is what anyone in the house wantswhen we ask unionist parties to serve in the assembly and more particularly on the executive it is important to ensure that they are dealing with people who have given up violence entirely the independent monitoring commission report has been discussed today and without seeking to be negative i want to deal with a couple of points that it makes paragraph 212 stateswe noted however that pira continued to engage in intelligence gathering predominantly to support the political strategythat intelligence gathering was predominantly\u2014not entirely\u2014to support the political strategy and the imc believed that itwas authorised by the leadership and involved senior membersthat is a worrying phrase the report goes on to saysome senior members were also involved in money laundering and other crimethat too is worrying paragraph 215 discusses a crime that was committed and sayswe think nevertheless that pira did seek to secure the departure from the area of one of the families involved in the disputein other words the provisional ira sought to move families out of the area the report continueswe also believe that in a separate incident pira itself may have been associated with the forced departure of somebody from the area where he livedsuch activity should have ended\u2014we were told that it had\u2014but according to the imc that is not the case", "i do not disagree but those people are not represented by a political party that will assume government office in northern ireland i am not trying to be negative as i have a point to make the report goes on to say thatthere are indications that some members including some senior ones    are still involved in crimethe report lists those crimes it is unfair to expect lawabiding constitutional politicians from the unionist community and from the sdlp to sit alongside people who are supposedly politicians by day but are terrorists by nighta further point concerns me about two years ago i had a discussion with seamus mallon a respected former member of this house and also a former deputy first minister he said that in his area sinn fein had 200 paid activists where did that money come from the minister who is to respond to the debate has a respectable majority of just over 6000 but how would he like it if there were 200 paid activists in his constituency trying to get rid of him that is not fair politics and it must be addressed alongside the fact that unionist and sdlp politicians are being asked to work with people who might be engaging in violence and terrorist activities at night it is not fair if that is not tackled the assembly will fail and i do not want to see that happen", "totally illegal as my hon friend observesi shall close now to give the minister a chance to respond to the many points that have been made by right hon and hon members i finish where i started i wish the assembly well i hope it gets up and running in order to succeed it needs to discuss meaningful matters it must be built on rock rather than on sand it has to be sustainable and over and above anything else it must be filled with members who are wholly and exclusively committed to democratic means", "i apologise to the hon lady for missing the beginning of her speech i have tabled an amendment for tomorrow that questions the clause that gives the secretary of state the power to delay that election", "the hon member for barnsley east and mexborough jeff   ennis is correct to stress the importance of renewable energy in great britain we produce only slightly more than 3 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources in spite of an existing renewables obligation what can the government do to ensure that the performance in northern ireland will be better than it is in great britain in northern ireland only 3 per cent of electricity is produced from renewable sources we need to increase that figure what can the government do to ensure that that percentage share increases quicker in northern ireland than it has done in great britain", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what compensation is available to a british citizens who are injured in terrorist attacks abroad and b the relatives of those killed and if he will make a statement", " further to that point of ordermr atkinson i echo the minister\u2019s thanks to you and your cochairman mr taylor and to your staff i thank my colleagues who have contributed today the minister referred i think to the silent majority when he thanked his back benchers but it is always interesting to take part in these debates and i look forward to further debates this week", " the minister has access to far more information than i have i was told that the obligation was for 63 per cent with an aspirational target of12 per cent", " i realise that this is a specialist area and i appreciate the minister\u2019s attempts to explain a difficult and complicated situationi shall reiterate what i was trying to say the regulation is one thing but the actual opening up of the market is another the existing longterm contracts present a bit of a problem because they could end up keeping the price of electricity high but as the hon member for east antrim said it is important to honour those contracts i hope that the minister will speak to his hon friend the undersecretary because it is important that we move as quickly as is fair towards an open market in electricity and not just harmonisation of regulation", " on this occasion i shall attempt not to stray on to the issue of russian gas supplieslet us compare the renewables market in this country with that in continental europe where the supply of renewable energy is far more prevalent continental europe generates far more electricity from renewable sources than we do as hon members might well be aware the renewables obligation covers great britain but we manage to generate only about 35 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources compared with the target of 104 per cent by 2010now that it is 2006 that target looks very ambitious but it does not seem awfully high when we consider the necessity of moving towards the cleaner generation of electricity for which the necessary technology has been around for some time for northern ireland there is \u00a0the nonfossil fuel obligation but that will be set at only 63 per cent by 2012 which is not terribly ambitious at the moment the figure is about 3 per centi accept that there are problems with the promotion of renewable energy in northern ireland that do not exist elsewhere in great britain where there is perhaps more potential for the generation of renewable electricity in encouraging renewable electricity in great britain the government have made the mistake of depending far too much on windmills although they have their place in electricity generation several problems are associated with them the biggest is that they are intermittent\u2014when the wind does not blow we get no electricity that might seem like an obvious statement but the wind tends to blow only 30 per cent of the time so we get electricity only during that time the great problem with electricity is that it cannot be stored so if the wind blows twice as hard one day we cannot get twice as much electricity and store it for a day when the wind does not blowfor two years i have tracked the government on energy issues and shadowed the minister for energy and i think that we need a much broader approach to developing renewable energy there is far too much emphasis on wind power\u2014", " thank you mr atkinson having visited a wind farm in northern ireland i felt slightly qualified to discuss the issue i am merely trying to suggest that the government take a much broader approach to developing renewable energy in northern ireland than they have in great britain the approach that they have taken in great britain has left us struggling to meet the targets and i do not want the government to fail to meet the modest targets in northern ireland if they are serious about developing renewable energy in northern ireland they need to be much more focused than they have been in great britain", " it was my pleasure to spend two years studying the great britain energy market and very detailed and complicated it was too i must confess to having not spent a great time studying the position in northern ireland or indeed in the republic of ireland but i want to make one or two remarks about it people in northern ireland pay more for energy than we do in great britain i want to explore why that is so and whether the bill holds out prospects of cheaper electricity for people in northern irelandmembers of the committee will remember that it was the conservative government who brought about privatisation but that it was the labour government who took it further and introduced neta\u2014the new electricity trading arrangements\u2014which under the energy act 2004 became known as betta\u2014the british electricity trading and transmission arrangements the government were right to introduce the change because it moved the position away from the old pool system of electricity that was based on longterm contracts to a much more fluid system that operated more like the stock market than it had previously as a result electricity prices in great britain fell considerably in relative terms to the extent that it became a slight problem in that at one point there was a shortage of investment in electricity generation because the price was so low and there was no incentive for companies to invest in generation during recent months there has been an increase in the price of electricity and gas although that is a slightly different issue it has been due to the world market that has been affected heavily by the oil situation as much as anything else it is a readjustment \u00a0of the prices of fuel rather than a failure of the market the trading arrangements that the government introduced did a good service to both producers of electricity in the long term and domestic and industrial consumerschanges are planned but the benefits did not extend to northern ireland in the way in which they should have done nor am i sure that they will do so under the clause although the clause is headed \u201csingle wholesale electricity market\u201d having discussed it with the relevant authorities in northern ireland my understanding is that the regulation of the market is being changed rather than a market being created i would be glad to be corrected there is not even one overall body being created i understand that there will be an attempt to harmonise the regulation of electricity in northern ireland with that in the republic we will not move towards the type of market that we enjoy in great britain so the benefits will not flow to consumers in northern ireland in the way that they have to those here again if i am wrong i will be pleased to be correctedi am a little concerned about the creation of northsouth bodies considering what the government said in their recent statement i hope that the assembly does get up and running because of the bill that we will consider tomorrow but i did not like the insinuation that there could be a strengthening of crossborder bodies even if the assembly is not running that was not what was agreed in the belfast agreement and i have some concern about iti do not want to be seen to be urging the creation of a northsouth body given the uncertainty of the situation but there are possible benefits in the creation of a bigger electricity market across the whole of ireland just as there would be in one that covered both the uk and ireland i am as antieu as one could wish to find in the house but there could even be benefits in creating a bigger electricity market across europe that does not necessarily mean that regulation would have to be as one although there would have to be some harmonisationthere are great difficulties in energy at the moment the uk increasingly has to get its energy from further afield not long ago we were a great producer of gas from the north sea we are now net importers of gas the places from where that gas is coming are slightly worrying russia algeria and other countries that might not be considered politically stable russia has recently ended its supply of gas to a couple of countries which cannot be a good thing", " i apologise for straying away from northern ireland the point that i seek to make is that i am not convinced that the clause will move us towards greater security in the supply of electricity or cheaper prices for consumers in northern ireland we need to look further into the future than the clause apparently does i would be pleased to be corrected \u00a0but from discussions with authorities in northern ireland i understand that the clause is modest maybe the government are planning ahead or maybe they intend to leave the issue to the assembly but i would like to hear the minister\u2019s response to my points", " i welcome you to the committee mr atkinson i apologise for arriving slightly late for this afternoon\u2019s sitting i do not want to speak for long on the clause but i am slightly concerned about the power that it gives to the secretary of state i was wondering whether the minister would explain why it is necessary as one or two hon members have commented to me we spend time on a bill and then we reach clause 18 which shows that it can all change by orderclause 182 states\u201cthe provision that may be made under subsection 1 includes provision amending or modifying\u2014a any provision of the 2000 actb schedule 2a to the 1983 act\u201dthe clause is wideranging will the minister explain why it is necessary to have such wideranging powersconservative members feel that if issues are important enough they should be in the bill we can then see what we are considering passing or rejecting and have the opportunity to debate the issues not just in statutory instrument committees which inevitably contain only a limited number of hon members if things are in the bill the whole house has the opportunity to discuss them so will the minister explain why clause 18 is necessary", " the hon gentleman will not be aware of a conversation that i had with mr seamus mallon a former member of the house he told me \u00a0that sinn fein had 200 paid activists in his area and that is from a nationalist politician not a unionist politician", " i am grateful to you mr taylor for the opportunity to discuss this clause briefly under the legislation donations to political parties in northern ireland from the republic of ireland will still be permitted in no way do i want to make a party political point but the concern is that donations from the republic benefit certain political parties to the exclusion of others the objective of much of our debate and legislation that has been introduced through statutory instruments and primary legislation is to normalise the situation between great britain and northern ireland i welcome the attempts to normalise and where possible make comparable the situation some of this legislation works towards that one aspect that does not is the provision for donations to political parties in northern ireland to come from donors in the souththere is a further complication it is possible for people who live abroad\u2014in america for example\u2014to make donations to political parties in northern ireland not necessarily directly but through citizens of the republic that is a concern i would have liked to limit the amount of time for which the provision exists stating that from let us say 2010 such donations would no longer be acceptablethe government\u2019s explanation for allowing donations from the south to be made to the north is that the two countries are inextricably linked and one party at least is registered in both countries so it is acceptable however if we are moving towards normalisation and equalisation i do not think that it is acceptable for that situation to continue therefore i am concerned that the government seem to be prepared to let it carry on indefinitely whereas i would have sought to end it\u2014not necessarily today or tomorrow but certainly by putting a three or fouryear limit on the arrangement i look forward to hearing other hon members comments because i know that the issue is of concern to a number of parties in northern ireland and to finding out what the minister has to say about the situation", " i shall speak to amendment no 9 which may sound a little heavyhanded and bureaucratic however i refer the committee back to our debate on the floor of the house about the control that the secretary of state might have over the chief electoral officer and the concern that was \u00a0expressed at the time i refer to the opportunity for the secretary of state to cancel a canvass of the electorate that might be recommended by the chief electoral officer and the fact that his reasons for cancelling such a canvass are apparently covered by the words \u201cin the public interest\u201d we did not receive a satisfactory explanation of that phrasethe chief electoral officer can be dismissed for the reasons set out in the bill according to clause 85d those include if\u201che is unable or unfit to carry out his functions\u201dthat could be considered slightly vague in the context of northern ireland in particular it is important to have a chief electoral officer with some degree of autonomy and independence i am concerned that that will not be the case under the arrangements that have been madei will not try the patience of the committee by going over the ground that we covered on the floor of the house as hon members will be familiar with what was said however if relations become strained between the secretary of state and the chief electoral officer it should be made public why the secretary of state feels the need to dismiss the chief electoral officer it seems a bit bureaucratic to lay the report before the houses of parliament but i do not think that it would take up a great deal of the secretary of state\u2019s time there are not many changes taking place with regard to drawing up the list of electors but transparency and more importantly confidence in the process in northern ireland are essential that is my motivation in introducing amendment no 9", " i join the minister in welcoming you to the committee mr taylor i have also had the pleasure of serving under you and i am sure that this too will be a pleasurable experiencethe minister is right in assuming that we have no objection to the programme motion but i should make just one point which i have raised before in committee and in the house we have rather a lot of northern ireland business to consider at the moment we were due to sit today and on thursday but the introduction of another bill means that we will now not sit on thursday in addition we had a rather ridiculous \u00a0situation on tuesday or wednesday last week when an important statement was made in the chamber at the same time as an important statutory instrument committee was beginning\u2014the two items of business overlapped even though both were extremely importanti therefore ask the government to be a little sympathetic to opposition parties which do not have as many front benchers and officials as the government i also ask them to think about their timetabled legislation the bill deals with important issues such as devolving policing and justice matters to the assembly the other bill which will be introduced tomorrow deals with the important issue of setting up the assembly such issues are not trivial and i ask the government to give a little more thought to the timetabling of northern ireland business having said that i have no objection to the programme motion", " i beg to move amendment no 11 in clause 8 page 7 line 28 after \u2018by insert\u2018her majesty the queen on the recommendation of", " i have just agreed to the programme motion but i do not intend to fill both sittings although if we need to do so we shall i do not want to drag debates out so i shall speak briefly to the amendment which is intended to probe the ministeri have mentioned in the chamber the fact that the police ombudsman for example is appointed by her majesty the queen no doubt on the recommendation of the secretary of state however the chief electoral officer is to be appointed by the secretary of state we had a long debate on that issue on the floor of the house during discussion of a separate amendmenti was concerned that there could be a rather incestuous relationship between the secretary of state and the chief electoral officer it particularly concerned me that in circumstances that were not clearly defined\u2014they were defined by the words \u201cpublic interest\u201d\u2014the secretary of state would have the power to cancel a canvass of the electorate if he felt that appropriatewe could not satisfactorily tease from the minister the circumstances in which it might be in the public interest to cancel such a canvass i have tabled the amendment to explore the situation again and ask the minister why it is appropriate for the secretary of state to make the appointment that seems inconsistent with other similar appointments", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation the concerns that we raised in committee in the house remain\u2014we were not satisfied with the explanation on that occasion\u2014but i accept that we were discussing a different amendment on a different day i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will introduce legislation to make it a defence in law for owners whose horses and other animals are involved in accidents to show that they have taken reasonable steps to avoid such accidents and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of statefor health when the payments due under agenda for change will be made and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport if she will make a statement on her plans to privatise the tote", "i simply do not believe that the minister has given an adequate explanation of why anyone would not want to support the police why on earth should they not want to do so can he give one reason", "it is not about that", "the minister has centred on the first part of the hon ladys amendment i take it that he will come to its second part and indeed to my amendment when he does so will he tell the committee whether he would be happy to have a minister in charge of the police\u2014given the crucial role that they play in any society\u2014who did not recognise the legitimacy of that police force", "the hon gentleman needs to make a better attempt at answering the very reasonable question asked by the hon member for north down lady hermon he said that the ira stated that the war was over but he knows as well as the rest of us that the elected sinn fein members do not take their seats in this house because they do not recognise the legitimacy of this parliament similarly they do not recognise the legitimacy of the police in northern ireland surely it is reasonable to expect someone who takes office and takes charge of the police to recognise their legitimacy that is what my amendment seeks to ensure", "we are discussing the devolution of policing and justice to the northern ireland assembly as and when it is up and running there is much concern on both sides of the house that there is a possibility that the responsibility for such important matters could fall into the wrong handsat a recent meeting with the police federation for northern ireland i was told about the fears that members of that organisation felt at the prospect of the assembly controlling policing and justice i understand that those fears have been communicated to the undersecretary of state for northern ireland the hon member for st helens south mr woodwardthe amendments in my name\u2014nos 21 and 22 and new clauses 3 and 4\u2014address those fears and would go some way to easing them they would ensure that people would not be able to take ministerial office in northern ireland unless they made a declaration before the assembly that they supported the police service of northern ireland and pledged to uphold the rule of lawamendments nos 21 and 22 would amend paragraph 58 of schedule 2 which statesthe relevant ministers    shall not take up office until each of them has affirmed the    pledge of officethat pledge includes a commitment to nonviolence and exclusively peaceful and democratic meansgiven that we are seeking to devolve policing and justice it does not seem to me to be asking a lot for potential ministers to affirm their support for the police the extra requirement in the amendment is a very minor adjustment and i should have thought that its inclusion should be axiomatic although it might seem a small step to me i accept that it might seem a large one to some people yet it would give at least some confidence to members of those political parties in northern ireland that show no reluctance about supporting the police and upholding the rule of law that people seeking to hold office would have the appropriate objectives in other words the amendments would add to the pledge of office a commitment to support the police i think that that is reasonablenew clause 3 would amend section 18 of the northern ireland act 1998 to ensure that people appointed as ministers have declared before the assembly that they also support the police and uphold the rule of law new clause 4 would amend section 30 of the 1998 act to allow for the exclusion from office of any person who is no longer committed to supporting the police and upholding the rule of law it would also provide for the exclusion from office of members of any political party that is no longer committed to supporting the police and upholding the rule of law finally it would empower the secretary of state to require the presiding officer to move a motion in the assembly excluding people from office if they or their party do not support the police or uphold the rule of lawi do not see why there should be a great deal of difficulty with the amendments i heard what the hon member for foyle mark durkan said and i agree with much of it although i draw a different conclusion if we leave matters as they are i understand that there will be stumbling blocks to the devolution of policing and justice and that more or less the same stumbling blocks would obstruct getting the assembly up and running in the first placei want the assembly to be up and running but first we must address the real and legitimate fears of the constitutional parties in northern ireland one fear is that ministers will come to office who are not persuaded that they should follow exclusively peaceful means another is that some members of the assembly might be ministers by day and terrorists\u2014if i may use that word\u2014by nightthose are real fears and the government must put pressure on the appropriate people we have had many debates in the house and in committee and as i said yesterday the minister of state has been unfailingly courteous i cannot remember one occasion when he has refused an intervention and i am sure that he will agree that members of all parties that have taken part in the debates have behaved in a very reasonable and constructive wayhowever one party has not taken part\u2014sinn fein the blame for the fact that the assembly does not sit should be placed not on the constitutional parties that sit in this house but on the party that does not appear here and on the ira if the minister accepts the amendments that would go some way towards addressing the real and legitimate fears expressed many times in the house by the constitutional parties in northern ireland", "i am grateful to all hon members who contributed i recognise the objections that have been made although the amendment seeks to give the assembly the option of that particular arrangement given that the minister has put on the record an assurance that an option already exists i am happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn", "i beg to move amendment no 18 in page 14 line 4 at end insert\u2014    the act may provide for the department to be in the charge of the first and deputy first minister acting jointly", "these too are probing amendments the bill as it stands allows for the assembly to provide that the new police and justice department be in the charge of two northern ireland ministers acting jointly or a northern ireland minister supported by junior ministers and for them to rotate my amendments would give the assembly the power to provide for the department to be in the charge of the first minister and deputy first minister acting jointly andor the first minister and deputy first minister supported by junior ministersthe reasoning behind the amendments is twofold first the department will be of such importance that putting it in the charge of the most senior ministers in northern ireland should rightly be an option secondly that kind of arrangement could provide crosscommunity control of policing and justice with all the necessary checks and balances in place i feel that that would have the potential to give at least some confidence to both communitiesi will not press the amendments to a vote and i will not detain the committee long on them the option was in the discussion paper circulated a while ago and i was a little surprised that it did not find its way into the bill since the amendments were tabled the minister has been kind enough to assure me that it is covered in the 1998 act i would like his assurance that the situation that i describe is a possibility should policing and justice be devolved", "i shall be very brief we have looked at the new clause and have some sympathy with it as we were not able to make progress on the previous two sets of amendments i do not want to detain the committee but we will consider the proposal in greater detail if it is resubmitted at a later stage", "i remind the minister that we accepted clause 2 only on the basis that our amendments to clause 3 would be accepted they would have provided the necessary checks and balances but they were not accepted", "i am grateful to the minister for clarifying that the chief electoral officers recommendation need not be made public and that it could be kept private\u2014interruption i hear the suggestion that there might be in the ministers own words a weak electoral officer such an officer would surely be bound to keep his recommendations private", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that observation i do not want to put words into his mouth but he seems to be suggesting that this is going to be a pretty lowgrade job i mean no disrespect to anyone who is about to hold the position of chief electoral officer but they will not have much autonomy or influence", "my hon friend is absolutely correct", "the hon gentleman is absolutely righti return to the point i made earlier the chief electoral officer will be able to make a recommendation in favour of a canvass being conducted in a certain year onlyfor the purpose of meeting the relevant registration objectivesthose objectives include ensuring thatevery person who is entitled to be registered in a register is registered in it    that no person who is not entitled to be registered in a register is registered in it and    that none of the required information relating to any person registered in a register is falseall those objectives seem reasonable to me the chief electoral officer can make a recommendation in favour of a canvass being conducted only on the basis of those objectives it worries me that the secretary of state will be able to fall back on an overriding principle in order to cancel such a canvass what could that principle be my hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack mentioned that the exercise would cost about the same amount as a modest flat in london i am not exactly with him on the property league i think that a more appropriate indicator would be a cost of slightly more than \u00a31 per elector in northern ireland but perhaps i do not live in the same area as him", "where i come from a street would be more appropriatein any club that is owned by its members the first duty of the secretary is to maintain a list of those members as they will determine the rules and the way in which the club is run surely the most important criterion of a democracy is an accurate register the minister is effectively saying okay but in certain circumstances there are more important considerations he now appears to disagree but in that case why does he not accept the amendments they are not very revolutionary i am not even suggesting that we should remove the phrase public interest i am seeking merely to ensure that we relate those words to clause 4 which the minister himself has proposed", "perhaps monkey and peanuts come to mind i do not know what the salary will be nevertheless the person who takes on the job will read this debate\u2014i do not suggest that they will be listening to it\u2014and be somewhat alarmed the minister may have put off a few potential applicants the job is going   to be a very lowgrade job the officers recommendation on the canvass need not be made public and can be overridden and the very important responsibilities that should go with the job will rest with the secretary of state this is a very lowgrade job", "it should be a highgrade responsible job the objectives of maintaining an accurate register are certainly extremely important i would find it very surprising if the secretary of state intervened to prevent a canvass that was recommended by the chief electoral officer given the importance especially in northern ireland of maintaining an accurate register a vague term such as public interest should be defined in the bill or at the very least\u2014i mean no discourtesy to the minister\u2014we should be entitled to a better explanation of what it might mean and of what circumstances might be more important than the criteria listed in clause 4it was not necessarily my intention at the beginning of the debate to press the amendment to a vote but in the absence of an adequate explanation i feel that we must do so", "in many hours of debate with the minister he has never failed to give way and i appreciate his courtesy under clause 3 the chief electoral officer would makea recommendation in favour of a canvass being conducted in that year for the purpose of meeting the relevant registration objectivesthose objectives are listed in clause 4 and one of them is to ensurethat every person who is entitled to be registered in a register is registered in itthat is an important reason to request that a canvass should take place but the minister is in effect arguing that there may be an overriding reason to prevent that register being accurate", "we have had another prolonged debate on an interesting subject and i should like to run through one or two points that have arisenas other hon members have said the previous consultations outside the house are not relevant we are here to consider the bill as legislators and we are entitled to raise points that were not necessarily raised beforeit is a recurring theme that ministers\u2014not this particular minister but the government\u2014are becoming rather isolated on northern ireland business given that sinn fein members do not take their seats in this house the labour party is frequently the only party putting forward the ideas that appear in the bill no other party from either side of the house including the sdlp is supporting the government on any issue only yesterday the government were isolated when a northern ireland order was discussed upstairs perhaps the minister should go away and reflect on a number of issues including that onei was a little concerned\u2014although perhaps it should not have surprised me\u2014when the minister said that if the chief electoral officers recommendation were to be overridden he would have the option of going public naively i had assumed that the recommendation would have been made public in the first place i would be happy for the minister to intervene on me to clarify that matter perhaps i have missed the point but i had assumed that the recommendation would automatically have been made public it alarms me that that might not be the case this will make the incestuous relationship between the secretary of state and the chief electoral officer to which i referred earlier even more dangerous than i had originally assumed i shall need to reflect on that", "it may have escaped the ministers attention but he has named virtually everyone who has taken part in any debate in the house today", "this set of amendments is intended not to remove the role of the secretary of state but to define the words public interest", "i beg to move amendment no 13 in clause 3 page 2 line 37 at end insert\u20142a for the purposes of subsection 2 the public interest is the requirement to meet the relevant registration objectives as set out in section 4", "these amendments are similar to the ones in the previous group and it was perhaps unfortunate that we could not consider them all at the same time i do not want to try your patience mrs heal but i suspect that it is to some degree inevitable that we might have revisit some of the arguments presented previouslywe had a long debate on the timing of the canvass the annual canvass has been abolished it is now proposed to hold a canvass in 2010 and possibly in intervening years as well unless the secretary of states makes an order providing that that requirement does not apply in intervening years the chief electoral officer can recommend that a canvass should be conducted but it will take place only if the secretary of state is satisfied that the public interest requires it indeed the 2010 canvass can be cancelled if the secretary of state having considered the ceos recommendation is satisfied that the public interest does not require ithon members from all parties have expressed concern about what the term the public interest means that is an important matter in great britain but the fact that citizens in northern ireland have generally been treated less well in legal terms than their counterparts in great britain means that the vagueness of the term arouses even more concern i have tabled these amendments to tease out from the minister the circumstances under which the 2010 canvass or a canvass in an intervening year might not take place i accept that the requirement to keep the debate relevant to the amendments under discussion limited his opportunity to expand on that previously and i hope that he will be able to say more this time", "i am grateful to my right hon friend for that intervention he is absolutely right as i tried to explain using the term public interest in respect of great britain is unacceptably wide to use it in terms of northern ireland requires some explanation with good reason to support itas i said in an intervention earlier i am a little concerned about the independence of the chief electoral officer perhaps the committee will forgive me if i fastforward to clause 8 which statesthe chief electoral officer    is appointed by the secretary of state    a person must not be appointed as chief electoral officer for more than 5 years at a timefurthermore he cannot hold office for more than 10 years by comparison the police ombudsman is appointed by her majesty the queen although i accept that it is by recommendation\u2014no doubt from the secretary of state why is the situation different for the chief electoral officerclause 8 does not lead us to believe that the ceo would be independent as i noted earlier the relationship between the ceo and the secretary of state will be somewhat incestuous the minister says that the 2010 canvass would be cancelled only if the ceo had made a recommendation against it but surely in the real world the secretary of state could put pressure on the ceo if he thought it appropriatei am concerned about the situation although as we explored it in great depth during the previous debate i shall not repeat the arguments but will the minister give us some examples of what the public interest would mean under the clause he gave a financial example to show why the 2010 canvass might not take place he has just had several minutes to discuss other possible examples with officials and colleagues so i hope that he can offer some to show why he feels that the secretary of state would overrule the ceo in particular will he give us his interpretation of what the public interest would actually mean", "going back to the previous point the minister said that the secretary of state could override the decision or recommendation of the chief electoral officer that worried me a little because the secretary of state will appoint the chief electoral officer unlike the police ombudsman for example so the relationship is a little incestuous", "briefly i wish to make two points about the amendments that we have tabled for the sake of clarification can the minister explain why the year 2010 was chosen does it have something to do with the general census if not it may have been a good idea to fall in with the censusin common with the hon member for north down    lady hermon and the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik we feel that a 10year interval is too long it is in everyones interest to encourage people to register to vote and to ensure that the register is up to date and accurate we did not object to clause 2 which abolished the annual canvass but a 10year interval is too long which is why we tabled our amendments we should therefore like the minister to explain why he chose 2010 to conduct a canvass and why he chose an interval of 10 years", "perhaps sir alan you will allow me briefly to add my tributes to her majesty the queen and to the right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley who on 6 april reached a similarly great milestonei too am puzzled by the governments approach to anonymous registration\u2014a point that was outlined eventually by the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik once he had managed to find his notes he made a good point in questioning why clause 10 of the electoral administration bill will not apply to northern ireland that is rather puzzlingi am a little concerned by the way in which legislation is being treated at the moment i hope that you will not consider it out of order sir alan if i mention that yesterday we had to consider an important order upstairs at the same time as an important statement on northern ireland was being made in the chamber i raised the issue on a point of order in committee yesterday because it does not seem to be a good way of managing what can hardly be described as trivia the measures that we are discussing are very important and i ask the government to consider my point when they introduce legislation and orders in one form or anotherall of us in committee yesterday questioned why the order was necessary when at that very time the government were saying in the chamber that they were looking to restore the assembly that seems a very odd way of going about business i will not try your patience any further on that sir alan but i would like to put it on the record that we cannot give legislation the serious treatment that it deserves when hon members are expected to be in two places at the same timei will not take much of the committees time on this issue other than to say that the official opposition understand the need for anonymous registration particularly but not exclusively in northern ireland other members have made points about how people in great britain might want to exercise the right to cast their votes but understandably for one reason or another do not feel safe about their names being on the register that problem exists in great britain but it exists particularly in northern ireland for reasons with which we are all unfortunately very familiar we therefore support the retention of the clause", "to ask

of state then we heard from my hon friend the member for aylesbury mr lidington who greatly impressed both sides of the house with his assertion that there should be no devolution of policing powers to people who are criminals by night\u2014", "indeed they may not even wait until night i am sure that the house will endorse my hon friends comments on that pointthe hon member for foyle mark durkan talked about what is not in the bill and he raised one or two important issues if i may i suggest that you and your colleagues madam deputy speaker have been correct to allow the debate to stray slightly wider to talk about the future role of mi5 because it is relevant the hon gentleman also spoke about possible exclusion from the assembly and the secretary of state assured him that he did not seek to bring that aboutthe hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik with whom i have shared proceedings on so many statutory instruments asked why the bill will create so many more statutory instruments the hon member for north down lady hermon said how good it was to be debating primary legislation and that is true but the downside is that it will lead to many more orders the government say that they are intent on getting the assembly up and running soon but it is rather contradictory to introduce so many important matters through statutory instrumentthe hon member for montgomeryshire also talked about recording people for electoral purposes and he    made a sensible suggestion there could be an opportunity to send out forms to households even though it is individuals who are registered to check that the details were correct i understand why the system is being changed and that in northern ireland people have to record much more information however i discussed the issue in northern ireland last week and it appears that people could still slip through the net the hon gentleman made a sensible proposal and perhaps we will discuss it in committee", "yes i find it rather odd which is all i need to say on that point it does seem to be contradictorythe hon member for south down mr   mcgrady spoke about the difficulty of fundraising for political purposes in northern ireland which was agreed by most members who spokemy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack expressed concern about the secretary of state having power to set the election date he was also concerned about devolving police powers while not all parties support the police that point was also raised by my hon friend the member for aylesbury it is not just a matter of joining police boards it is about hearts and minds and providing evidence to the police when crimes have taken place that has not been the case we are far from that position and it is a concernthe right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley in a typically passionate speech talked about people connected to terrorism not being allowed to sit on police boards or in government he said that it is odd to be debating things that will not come about in other words we will need the assembly to be up and running before the devolution of policing it seems an odd situation for us to be inif i am quoting him correctly the hon member for blaydon mr anderson was probably calling for the nationalisation of the energy industry he is not objecting to my paraphrase of his words i cannot say that i agree with him on that point he also strongly made the point that nobody should be a terrorist and a democratic politician he was very clear that people have to make up their minds they have to become democratic politicians and give up terrorism for good he sounded an optimistic note but i am not sure that it was entirely shared by the housethe hon member for belfast north mr dodds made a reasonable and wideranging speech he endorsed calls for all parties to support the police and called for people to give up private armies he questioned the need for them he also raised an interesting point regarding donations he said that whether donations coming from the republic are legal will depend on irish law not our own that seems to be a strange situation especially when as i understand it money could come from america if it comes through the right channels i do not think that is in the spirit of the laws that have been passed by this parliament there is a legal issue there and possibly a constitutional one and it needs to be discussedthe hon member for belfast south dr mcdonnell welcomed moves towards a bigger energy market and said that he would welcome a british isles market he called for an increase in the use of renewable energy there is a point about the energy market as i understand it there will not be one regulator for north and south but there will still be one regulator in the north and one in the south who will attempt to harmonise regulation we are not moving towards the full position that we have in great britain where we had new electricity trading arrangements that have since changed to betta\u2014the british electricity trading and transition arrangements\u2014and there is an internal competitive market that supplies electricity we are not moving towards such an arrangement because of the need for transparency in northern ireland and because the market even with the south will not be big enough it would be advantageous for people in northern ireland and southern ireland if we had that bigger market and a better trading arrangement we would then see prices fall just as they fell in great britain when that system was introduced here by the government this is a complicated area and i hope that i have expressed my view on it reasonably clearlymy hon friend the member for lancaster and wyre mr wallace stressed the need to remove violence as an option he spoke about how some people are talking about it as no longer being a first option but a final option that cannot be right either that is equally wrongmy hon friend also discussed the need to extend the arms amnesty which the government say is necessary to take into account paramilitary weapons on the loyalist side however we can equally say that there is a need for the amnesty to include the remaining weapons on the republican side many members expressed the view that the republican movement has not yet got rid of all its armsthe hon member for belfast east mr robinson in a long but entertaining speech covered many issues one of the most interesting was whether it would be possible to get the devolution of policing through when there was a 40 per cent unionist vote in the assembly i look forward to the ministers responsethe hon gentleman bravely questioned the basis for the agreement in relation to crosscommunity support obviously the whole agreement is about bringing people from the different communities together yet that is one of the things that is holding up the process when the issue of south africa was raised the hon member for belfast north said that it was not relevant yet in a sense it is because for south africa to move on people had to stop talking about their particular national identity rwanda moved on when people stopped saying that they were members of a particular tribehowever in northern ireland we have i regret institutionalised sectarianism and 5050 police recruitment offers an example several members said that they disapproved of that recruitment policy the hon member for north down referred to the issue and spoke movingly about murders committed by loyalist gangs which are completely unacceptable like my hon friend the member for aylesbury i condemn violence from whichever side it comes it must end there is no reason or excuse for itthe hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson has been consistent for many years in his opposition to sharing government with people linked to terrorist organisations but he told us passionately how much he wants the assembly to be up and running so that it can deal with many of the issues that are dealt with in the house he too spoke against 5050 recruitmenti am concerned about the falling number of police reservists and about the fact that it seems that they will be replaced by community support officers the bill does not include such provisions but the policy causes great concern in northern ireland so the government may want to address itthe hon member for east antrim sammy wilson spoke of the need for safeguards in respect of information gathering when the role of mi5 in northern ireland changes he made the important point that mi5 must be sure to pass on to the police information that the police would regard as helpful there were reports in the northern ireland press recently about one serious occasion when that had not occurred i do not want to explore that point at this stage but the issue is realthe hon member for south antrim dr mccrea suffered as i have suffered many times in the house by speaking right at the end of a long debate he was able to speak only for about two minutes so although he is always worth listening to on this occasion we were not allowed that luxury for very longas my hon friend the member for aylesbury said we shall not divide the house tonight but there are several issues that we want to examine in committee and i am glad that some of the committee stage will be taken on the floor we want to consider whether the electoral office changes could be slightly better made police and justice devolution is a big issue and we also want to discuss the funding of political parties i want to explore whether more could be done to help to reduce the cost of energy in northern ireland and whether renewable energy can be brought in more quickly because it is being adopted extremely slowly throughout great britainwe give the bill a cautious welcome and look forward to further discussion of it and indeed to the ministers response to the debate", "is the hon gentleman aware that an action taken by his own party\u2014the creation of the new electricity trading arrangements\u2014further liberalised the market causing energy prices to fall even more that was not just due to our good work but also due to his partys good work", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills how much government funding has been provided for communication aids projects in a england and b

back for this debate the hon member for upper bann did not come to hear what i have to say so i hope that he will not consider it a discourtesy if i do not speak for more than one minute i want the minister to respond to all the good points that have been made i shall have to apologise to my researcher who has dug out a lot of information for me as is typical in this place it will not unfortunately be read outi shall make just one point i have been going to northern ireland for many years since long before i got this job people who have never been there ask why do you go is it not awful full of trouble and dangerous that is the perception my one point is that that is what we have to change business can be attracted to northern ireland in many of the ways that have been described but if i could change one aspect of the situation it would be that perception which is wrong there are problems of course\u2014there always have been\u2014but it is a wonderful place the people are very accommodating and that is the message that we need to get out to the world\u2014that is what we should be about my remarks have been brief i want the minister to respond to the

the paymaster general has for example increased the disregard from \u00a32500 to \u00a325000 but that addresses only part of the problem surely it is better to make the system efficient rather than

consultation document on the provision of stoma and other appliances and if she will make a statement", "has the hon gentleman considered the logical conclusion of his argument which is that there is great demand for pubs in which people can smoke", "amendment no 36 accepts that there may be a case for banning smoking in certain public places but excludes pubs restaurants and clubs and indeed the home i declare that i am a smoker but i consider myself to be a considerate smoker i would not want to smoke in anyones car house or office or even in their company unless they were happy with that or smoked themselves it is because i am a considerate smoker that i find the proposed measures intolerant not to mention illiberal and belonging to the nanny statei understand the right of people not to inhale the smoke that i exhale but there is no reason why the rights of both smokers and nonsmokers cannot be accommodated we already have nonsmoking pubs springing up all over the place there are some in my constituency we have many pubs that are mixed with smoking areas and nonsmoking areas and we have pubs that are smoking throughout we hear from hon members on both sides that there is a great demand for nonsmoking pubs and if that is so the free market which i thought new labour believed in these days will deliver those pubs and everybody will be happyit is my contention that the person best placed to decide whether or not to have smoking in his establishment is the pub landlord or the restaurateur with due regard to his staff and customers i do not accept that a ban would not lead to an increase in smoking at home and i am disappointed that so much concern is rightly expressed for the welfare and health of workers but that few of those who make such protestations have talked about the rights of children in the home are they not to be protected i am convinced that more people will smoke at home than at present but we do not seek to protect the rights of children", "i am sorry but i do not have timemany staff in pubs smoke themselves and many small country pubs will be threatened by the ban we hear especially from labour members who oppose an exemption for private clubs that people will flock from the pubs into such clubs the logical conclusion of that argument is that there is a great demand for pubs that allow smoking and many of them are small pubs in country areas along with the post offices and shops in country areas they will be under threat the landlord and landlady of the local inn in my home village of twyning both smoke they do not employ any staff so why should they be covered by the ban that would be totally intolerantthe logical conclusion of the health argument is that the government should ban smoking altogether smokingrelated diseases cost the nhs \u00a318 billion year that is a fair amount but rather insignificant when compared with the \u00a381 billion that smokers put into the exchequer every year that explains the governments hypocrisy in refusing to ban smoking entirely\u2014it is due to moneyof course i share concerns about staff who work in smoky establishments when they do not want to however jobs in the catering industry are very difficult to fill that is why so many illegal immigrants are employed in catering other people have the option to go and work elsewhere we talk about people working in smoky atmospheres but what about those who work in coal mines or with dangerous chemicals or hazardous waste those problems have all been ignored today and that is because they are difficult to deal with however if we were being consistent we would be considering them as welli have been asked to keep my remarks brief\u2014interruption it is a pity that labour members did not do the same and that their arguments were not more consistent i shall end by saying that this is a very illiberal and totally unnecessary measure we can protect peoples health without this draconian legislationi shall vote against the new clause if we get that far i hope that the house will vote for amendment no 36 which is far more tolerant", "prisoners cannot vote either", "will the secretary of state confirm that a mass murderer in prison will be able to exercise his right to have a cigarette even though prison staff will inhale his smoke yet lawabiding people who go into pubs will not be able to do so", "further to that point of order mr speaker i endorse the comments made by my right hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst mr forth you will note mr speaker that my amendment no 36 accepts that some places may be deemed smokefree but that licensed premises would not be smokefree and thus not caught by the legislation is it your intention to allow a vote on that amendment too if we get to that point", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs to what percentage of the total length of rivers in the united kingdom canoeists have full access throughout the

constituencies concerned are those who do not vote for sinn fein yet end up with no representation in the house because of the decision of sinn fein", "as we discussed in the northern ireland grand committee yesterday there are several bright spots in the economy of northern ireland but there are one or two problems the minister will be aware that many people in northern ireland are concerned that the province is overdependent on the public sector which appears to be growing what does she intend to do to redress that growing imbalanceinvest ni has raised several concerns such as the low spending on research and development by businesses the low rate of business startups and the fact that northern ireland has the highest economic inactivity rates in the uk those are real problems and i wish the minister well in tackling them can she tell us exactly what she will do to improve matters", "i am pleased to have secured this debate after weeks of trying but i rather regret the need for it the minister for sport will know why i say that as he was kind enough to attend the previous debate that i obtained on the subject on 8 may 2002 indeed that was my second debate on the issue the previous one was on 20 december 2000 when the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey replied for the government i met the minister after that debate to discuss the problem many years on it remains my concern that organisations in my constituency get very little money relative to the rest of gloucestershirei welcome the fact that my neighbours in gloucestershire get a lot of lottery funding and i wish them well they have obviously submitted a lot of good applications and i hope that they continue to be successful however if i go through the figures the minister will see the cause of my alarm since the start of the national lottery there has been about \u00a3125 million in grants\u2014", "to gloucestershire i mean there have been grants of \u00a3125 million or thereabouts to organisations in gloucestershire if tewkesbury were to get the same amount as other constituencies in gloucestershire it would get some 167 per cent of that money i accept that there will be variations but it currently gets only 449 per cent that figure is very slightly up since last time i held a debate on the subject when it was 34 per cent but at this rate i calculate that it will take us 44 years to get up to the average we now get the very slightly increased 449 per cent but it is not acceptable that organisations in tewkesbury should lose out to that extent tewkesbury has received only \u00a356 million whereas if we were to get the average the figure would be something like \u00a321 millionlet me compare the figures for the other constituencies in gloucestershire cheltenham has received nearly \u00a323 million cotswold \u00a325 million forest of dean \u00a310 million gloucester \u00a338 million stroud almost \u00a324 million and tewkesbury only \u00a356 million the point is that we are not even remotely close to amounts received in other constituencies if we got 12 or 13 per cent of the money coming into the county i probably would not have held three debates on the subjectthe natural response which i have heard in the past has been to ask whether organisations in tewkesbury are actually applying for sufficient numbers of grants well it is difficult to tell these days when i held my first debate the figures were available from the government and they showed that tewkesbury was applying for plenty of grants by the second debate in 2002 those figures were not available from the government and i have not been able to access them in any way so i cannot answer whether organisations in tewkesbury are applying for as many grants as those in other parts of the county as far as i know those figures are not available although they certainly used to bei can cite a number of grant applications that have been turned down as far as i can see they were very good applications indeed tewkesbury sports centre had two failed bids it is based at a successful school that takes children from all kinds of backgrounds the school serves some areas that are perhaps a little more prosperous but it also serves areas such as priors park which is undergoing a great deal of regeneration and northway where there are ongoing problems with youths on street corners the school is ideally positioned to help those people yet the sports centre has had two failed bidsthe jet age museum has made at least one bid perhaps two as the minister will be aware it is in the area where the jet engine was invented there is a good deal of heritage about the museum which deals with an important part of our history i have visited it on a number of occasions and it is very well run indeed a number of enthusiastic people are involved with it yet it has not been able to access lottery money nor is it based in the most prosperous of areastewkesbury and district council of voluntary services had an application turned down that was to support various voluntary organisations in the borough such as a supportfortheelderly day care centre it would have brought together a whole range of voluntary agencieschurchdown sports centres bid failed too i have mentioned that before the reason given for its failure was that it was within 20 minutes drive of a similar facility in gloucester the point i have made in the past is that children do not drive or should not and if they get a lift from their parents it means four journeys\u2014that is going there and back twice that is at a time when we are supposed to be reducing car journeys and building sustainable communities the reason given for that failure is not acceptable as a result of the failed bid the sports centre is struggling and the borough council wonders whether it can continue to support the centre the very existence of which is now in questionit would be a very retrograde step if that sports facility were lost i want to press that home to the minister churchdown is still technically a village but it has a population of some 10000 or 11000 depending on how wide one makes the count it is an area with a lot of young people and they need something to do it is not overendowed with facilities i deeply regret that that organisation did not manage to get the grant and that it is struggling nowto go back to 2002 tewkesbury got a little bit of money under the fair share initiative but it was way way down on the list i have looked into the new scheme and it seems that tewkesbury will not be one of the areas that will benefit i am the first to say that the national lottery has been a great success in my notes i have put it in brackets that it was a conservative success but it would not be right to dwell on that the lottery has raised \u00a318 billion for good causes and i understand that 220000 projects have succeeded indeed there has been some success in my constituencyonly recently in a village called bishops cleeve a new sports area was opened by the very famous sir geoff hurst it was a great privilege to have him in the village although he lives in cheltenham now it was a successful day and he was very popular and the new facility is very good in the village of twyning where i happen to live there is a very good sports facility although i played no part in attracting the money i am not in any way knocking the national lottery or saying that we have not had any benefit at all we certainly have but not the kind that we deservewhen i explored this issue in the past the question was raised of how we determine where the money should go one of the issues that has been put to me is that of deprivation areas that are deprived should receive more funding than those that are not i accept that there is a certain logic to that but the problem is how we measure deprivation one problem is that when a fairly large area is assessed there may well be pockets of deprivation although the whole area may not be deprived according to all the measures that is one problem that we have had in tewkesburya lot of rural areas are deprived the area that i represent is very rural there are some builtup areas as i have mentioned but there are pockets of rural deprivation too there are many small villages without any shops or facilities at all quite often public transport between villages is very poor there are quite poor rail links between gloucestershire as a whole and london for example there are trains but it may be surprising to hear that one often has to change at least once in the journey from cheltenham to london that is rather surprising because cheltenham is a main town and a lot of things go on there yet the rail link is poor there is a better rail link north of my constituency which goes up to evesham\u2014it is not particularly brilliant but it is better\u2014but there is not a good link between gloucestershire and london we have a problem therethere are a lot of farmers in my area and farming incomes continue to fall quite a number of rural post offices have closed and if i may be controversial for a moment the hunting ban has not helped the countryside i put that very gently a number of rural pubs in my area are also very concerned about the proposed smoking banthere are pockets of deprivation in my constituency people perhaps think of tewkesbury as a good tory seat which must be rich but that is not so it is a mixed area there are prosperous parts but there are also many areas that are not if we are using deprivation as a measure of where to send the money we need to look more closely at tewkesburythere is also the heritage aspect the battle of tewkesbury took place in 1471 as a lancastrian i do not want to say the wrong side won when the yorkists got their last great victory of the war of the roses\u2014we got our own back at bosworth field there is great heritage in the town the townsfolk got together and collected money to pay off king henry viii and the famous tewkesbury abbey survived two rivers meet there\u2014the severn and the avon\u2014and we have lots of rich history however we need some help from funds such as the heritage lottery fundeven under the heritage lottery fund however tewkesbury comes bottom of the league in gloucestershire we cannot even get the funding for heritage we are bottom of the league in terms of charitable organisations and arts funding with millennium funding we are fifth out of six but only by \u00a32000 we are fifth in sports funding by some \u00a32000 in health education and the environment we come fifth but by only \u00a33000 in virtually every way we look at it tewkesbury comes bottom of the gloucestershire league if we look at the six headings\u2014arts charity heritage millennium sports and health education and the environment\u2014and the six constituencies making a multiple of 36 different bids we come last almost every timei genuinely do not know why this is so organisations in tewkesbury have submitted applications but some that failed were good and solid and not in any way frivolous and an awful lot of work went into preparing them i can personally vouch for those organisations those applications failed but throughout the county millions of pounds has gone to organisations in other constituenciesi want to finish where i started i wish the successful organisations well and i am pleased that they have received funding but i think that the minister will agree that the 45 per cent of the funding that we receive in tewkesbury does not look right\u2014it seems unfair\u2014and is only a slight increase on the 35 per cent that we got when i last had this debate i hope that i do not have to return to the chamber to take up hon members and the ministers time by complaining yet again i am more than happy to meet the minister or his officials to discuss how we might assess what is going wrong and how we might decide how to put it rightperhaps the minister or his officials might find time to help me in that respect for now i should like him to give me whatever answers he feels he can i am grateful to him for turning up i know that he has many other issues to deal with but i stress that we have seen great benefits coming from the very few projects that have been financed in tewkesbury and i want to extend that to the other applications that have been made on the part of the people of my constituency", "to ask the secretary of state for health if she will issue guidelines to primary care trusts on the prescribing of

your chairmanshipi thank the minister for the way in which he has dealt with the bill i think that he took every intervention that was asked of him i look forward to him returning on report with one or two of opposition members\u2019 suggested improvements", " i beg to move amendment no 147 in clause 24 page 13 line 18 at end add\u2014\u20182an order under this section may not be made unless a

parliament and that no such action should be taken until the assembly has been up and running for two years", " i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " during the division the minister had a private word in passing with me about the clause i am happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendment", " i beg to move amendment no 142 in clause 18 page 9 line 35 leave out \u2018advocate\u2019 and insert \u2018attorney\u2019", " i should point out for the record that we are against the bill and against every clause in it even though for various reasons it has not been necessary to vote against

advocategeneral for northern ireland but only following the devolution of justice and the appointment by the first and deputy first ministers of an attorneygeneral for northern irelandthe clause as it is worded appears to relate to an office that will exist only after the devolution of justice our amendment would make the secretary of state consult with the attorneygeneral for northern ireland

must consult and secure the approval of the northern ireland judicial appointments commission\u2019", " the amendment refers to the appointment of appeals commissioners i have no intention of speaking to it at length but i want to introduce the concept of involving the northern ireland judicial appointments commission and i wonder what the minister has to say about it", " i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " the hon gentleman made the point that the terrorism bill will not have the same effect as the northern ireland offences bill but there is another point to consider if we do not agree to the amendment the terrorism bill will not in practice be applied in northern ireland", " the hon member for belfast east put it rather well when he said that we have reached the position of ultimate absurdity or words to that effect", " i shall reply to the intervention then give way i am unsure what the relevance of the figures was they do not tell us anything at a certain point in the process people were not arrested for being members of the ira that did not mean that the ira had gone away it just meant that it was politically convenient not to arrest them for that particular offence", " i cannot understand the minister\u2019s reasoning perhaps he will tell us what it is when he intervenes", " i thank the minister for that intervention i feel a bit like a referee in this contest perhaps facilitator might be a better wordmay i suggest to the minister that he asks his officials to check those figures and that he writes to members of the committee the hon member for lagan valley has named people who are not in prison none the less i do not see how the minister\u2019s point about the number of licences that have been withdrawn is that relevant to the point that i was makingas my hon friend the member for bournemouth east said to shy away from the amendments because they might set a precedent is beyond belief the entire bill is a precedent\u2014an unwelcome one to give just one example of many that can be found in the bill retired judges do not preside over murder cases in great britainthe minister says that he wants to be consistent with the position on life sentences in great britain but to my knowledge people who get life sentences go to prison it is a condition of parole that people are not released until they are not a danger to the public but such people are already in prison the situation is completely different and we cannot put the two together the people who will go through the tribunal will not serve a single day in prisonall the amendment is asking is that people do not become a danger to the public the clause does not say that the psni or anybody else should be involved it states\u201cdoes not become a danger to the public\u201dthe condition is not that such people might become a danger to the public but that they actually have become a danger to the public can the minister say that that is okay i cannot understand how the government could reject this gentle and sensible amendment", " my hon friend is right i will tell him exactly what such people will do they will rejoin the ira if that is where their sympathies lie because they will not lose their licence or be prevented from benefiting from the scheme if they do so they will be prevented from entering the scheme if they rejoin or join a specified organisation but not if they return join the ira and presumably even become a danger to the public", " i beg to move amendment no 135 in clause 10 page 7 line 9 leave out from beginning to second \u2018the\u2019", " clause 10 deals with the conditions to which the licence is subject subsection 2b refers to\u201cin the case of a sentence of life imprisonment the condition that he does not become a danger to the public\u201damendment no 135 would omit the words\u201cin the case of a sentence of life imprisonment\u201dso that the provision would apply if the person became a danger to the public regardless of whether was a life sentence that is sensible we cannot understand why that should be a licence condition if one has received a life sentence but not if one has not surely the critical point is whether the person is likely to be a danger to the public to reject the amendment would be to say \u201cit\u2019s okay if they are a danger to the public\u201d that cannot be the minister\u2019s intentionwe tried to introduce a similar condition in clause 3 but we did not manage to get the amendment made we are not certain yet whether people returning to the jurisdiction will have to face court\u2014indeed there will not be a court but a tribunal\u2014or whether they will have to spend any time in prison surely we can expect that they do not become a danger to the public having been given the getoutofjailfree card that should be a minimum requirementamendment no 137 would add a further condition to ensure that the individual in question has never been convicted of a crime carrying a prison sentence of five years or more", " if the minister is saying that terrorists in northern ireland should be treated in the same way as murderers in great britain i go along with that but i do not think that that is what the bill is about it is about creating special conditions\u2014letting people go free no matter what they have done surely we can then impose the restriction that they do not become a danger to the public", " i too shall be brief i support the amendment proposed by my hon friend the member for lagan valley mr donaldson my hon friend the member for lancaster and wyre mr wallace made an intervention that the committee found somewhat humorous but he made a serious point which was underlined by my hon friend the member for lagan valley the fact that the committee found it humorous shows what a ridiculous bill this is it is full of inconsistencies and things that will be most offensive to many people in northern ireland the fact that there will not even be a serving judge in charge of the process is typical of the rest of the bill and that is very unfortunatemy hon friend the member for lagan valley did not go quite as far as i would have done i should just say that i have every respect for people who are retired to draw an analogy before i came to this house i used to do quite a lot of charity fundraising professionally and it is typical for there to be a chairman of a fundraising appeal the advice was always that if there was to be a chairman it should be someone who was still working and had not retired simply because if they had retired they would have lost their contacts which are very useful for fundraising organisations in the same way a retired judge will not be up to speed with legal practicesin my youth i studied law through a correspondence course but i was advised not to do it by correspondence simply because in law things change so quickly having a retired judge in charge of the process is a further insult to the people of northern ireland", " if the hon gentleman is asking me whether there is a difference between someone who retired 20 years ago and someone who retired six months ago yes there is of course there is a difference but i still think it is unacceptable to use a judge who retired six months ago", " my hon friend makes two very good points i would go further and say that as far as i can see there is nothing in the legislation about the retraining aspect either i would like to say quite a bit more on this issue but given your call for brevity sir nicholas i will conclude my remarks now i very much support the proposal introduced by my hon friend the member for lagan valley", " welcome back to the chair sir nicholas as you will not be serving this afternoon i should like to say what a pleasure it has been to work under your chairmanship i thank you for your guidancenew clause 18 would require defendants to appear before a court it would make two changes one is that defendants would be required to appear before a court rather than a tribunal and the second is that they would be required to appear at all we had a long debate on whether they should be tried in absentia or be required to appear before the tribunal and the minister said that he would go away and think about it he has had time to do a bit of thinking if not necessarily to come up with an amendment but i do not wish to press that point to a votewhy is a special tribunal necessary when the court system is already set up and running the secretary of state\u2019s explanation in the chamber on second reading was not entirely satisfactory he said that such proceedings would clog up the court system i am not sure how he can make that assessment given the minister\u2019s and the secretary of state\u2019s responses to the questions that we have asked we do not know how many people will qualify under the scheme the secretary of state\u2019s explanation if it can be called that was unsatisfactory so i should like the minister to explain itas the minister said that he would respond on report possibly with an amendment dealing with appearing before the tribunal my new clause has become nothing more than a probing amendment i do not intend to press it to a vote given his reasonable approach but i should like an explanation of why we must have a completely new system called a tribunal rather than the crown court", " i welcome you back to the committee mr taylor our amendments nos 131 132 133 and 134 are along the same lines as amendment no 29the people of northern ireland are insulted by the bill and although the minister says that he may correct the provision people who have committed the most terrible crimes will not have to appear in front of a court there will not be a court but even if there were and people appeared in front of it they would not have to serve a single day in prison for the crimes that they had committed that is a terrible insult to the survivors and people whose relatives and loved ones have been murdered as the hon member for east antrim sammy wilson says the bill is inconsistent with the northern ireland sentences act 1998 under which there was a minimum requirement it was not long considering the seriousness of some of the crimes but it was a requirement of sortsthe secretary of state\u2019s explanation on second reading was that the government want to get people through the system as if that will correct everything it may make it legally tidy as i said on second reading if the prime minister is considering retiring before the next election it puts everything neatly together for him\u2014in a box all done with however it is not all done with for the survivors and those who must live with the consequences it is not done with for the people who suffered the pain we should be thinking about themi am sorry to say that none of us in committee has been able to extract from the minister or the secretary of state the reason for the bill we have asked about the consequences if it were not introduced we were told that the ira is disarming or even that it has disarmed and stood down its units but to the question \u201cwhat will be the consequences if we don\u2019t introduce the legislation\u201d there has been no answer we have asked who the legislation is for surely the victims and the relatives of the victims are those who matter yet they do not want the legislation so what is it forthe hon member for belfast east mr robinson asked why it was necessary for these people to come back will a great success have been achieved if people come back to northern ireland from abroad or beyond the jurisdiction obtain a certificate and get a licence will we really have achieved that much why go through all the pain what will be achievedthe secretary of state also said on second reading that there is a sort of acceptance that there would be no punishment he said that people are not being punished now because they are on the run if we follow \u00a0 that argument through to its logical conclusion we could say here in great britain that if a murder is committed and the police know who committed the murder but have not caught that person after a while we can say \u201cokay we have not caught that person and brought him to justice so let us write the crime off completely\u201d that is the logic conclusion of the billwe tabled amendments similar to that tabled by the hon member for east antrim we are short of time in committee but the fact that i have made a brief speech should not be taken to mean that i and the other conservative members of the committee\u2014when they turn up\u2014are not worried about this aspect of the bill we are most concerned we are offended by it during my eight years in the house there have been times when legislation passed in connection in northern ireland has almost made me ashamed of my profession and today is one such day", " the minister is basically reiterating the position he is not telling us why it is so important that these people come back he mentioned the victims but the victims do not want this legislation i know that he has promised to review the nonappearance part of the bill but the whole bill was put together with nonappearance in mind it could not \u00a0 have been in the government\u2019s mind that the victims would know who committed the crime when the bill was drawn up", " i am grateful to the minister for giving way again he has been extremely generous throughout the entire committee he keeps saying \u201cthe victims will not have\u201d but the victims do not want the bill will he deal with that", " the minister has mentioned trial in absentia often enough to convince me that he thinks this is the best provision in the bill", " for the record we support the amendment tabled by the hon member for belfast east i do not intend to speak at length because we are coming to new clause 18 which would go a little further in replacing the tribunal with a court it would also place on the defendant a duty to appear in front of that court and make it a criminal offence if he did not", " i do not know whether the minister intended to say it but i want clarification and confirmation of whether he said that the reasons will be made public is that correct", " i support the amendment i would like to take the committee back to an earlier discussion that we had about the certification commissioner we discussed an amendment saying that he \u201cmay\u201d issue a certificate but the minister said that the term must be \u201cmust\u201d however we have now reached clause  where the word used is \u201cmay\u201d not \u201cmust\u201d which is rather confusing i suppose that that is in keeping with the enormous inconsistencies in the bill but it is not acceptable", " does the minister not understand why this is causing so much concern when somebody applies for a certificate it has to be given but we are told that a certificate may be withdrawn everything is pointing one way\u2014in the direction of the terrorist if he is so concerned about an organisation becoming specified after somebody has supported it why is that in the bill as a condition", " amendments nos 122 123 and 124 are slightly different from those tabled by the hon lady from whom we have a slightly different view on the matter although we are happy to discuss itwe believe that it is wrong for any proceedings that are already going on to be suspended in some cases we can see that possibly\u2014i stress that word strongly\u2014there might be a case for not commencing new proceedings as outlined in the clause but we do not see the case for ending those that have already begun a great deal of expensive work could already have been done in many cases and we simply see no justification for ending them at such a pointthe hon lady made some good points in support of her amendments but i am concerned about the comparison between clauses 5 and 7 clause 5 states\u201cwhere a person applies for a certificate  no proceedings may be commenced  any such proceedings already commenced are to be suspended\u201dclause 7 relates to when the certificate is awarded and provides that no further investigations may be made that is very unsatisfactory i do not want to speak at length but i seek from the minister an explanation of why the clause is drafted in this way", " in support of the hon member for north down i should say that the application is mentioned in clause 5 so she is not going over past debates", " this is a small point but it could be important perhaps there is a drafting error when the hon member for north down drew the committee\u2019s attention to the phrase \u201ca person applies\u201d the minister explained that that is basically anybody it cannot be because clause 52 says that\u201cthe court has the same powers to remand the person in custody or on bail\u201dit is not possible to remand on bail or in custody someone who has just made an application unless that is the person who has committed the crime", " john major tried", " i welcome you back to the committee sir nicholas this is the beginning of the discussion about the involvement\u2014or lack of it\u2014of the applicant in the process i have no hesitation in supporting the amendment tabled by the hon member for solihull indeed our names are also on the amendment paperwe will have a longer debate about appearances in court when we reach clause 8 so far we are discussing the making of an application however the two matters are linked as the hon member for north down lady hermon said this is just the beginning of the deeply offensive part of the bill it is all offensive but this is the worst section once someone has applied for a certificate on someone else\u2019s behalf whether he or she has permission to do so or not clause 5 which is a bad clause will kick in clause 6 then clause 7\u2014exemption from arrest\u2014and then clause 8 under which individuals do not have to attend court will all kick in clause 4 is the beginning of the processsurely it is right that applicants should be very much involved in that process they should be made to understand what is happening and to have some sense of the victims\u2019 concerns i cannot see why the government have designed the bill in this way why should applicants not at least have to sign the application in order to authorise it whenever one is nominated for something as trivial as membership of a club or for something as important as the leadership of the conservative party of which we have had a bit of practice in recent years one must consent to the \u00a0 nomination the bill is therefore an extraordinary piece of legislation in many ways and clause 4 is yet another example of how the bill disregards the victims\u2019 feelings i find that very offensive i will be very interested to hear what the minister has to say about the noninvolvement of applicants in the application processwith your permission sir nicholas i am sure that we shall return to what should prove to be a longer debate on clause 8 which deals with appearance in court however i shall be very interested to see how the minister can defend this particular clause", " i cannot withdraw the amendment the minister has not satisfied us so i wish to press it to a division", " i beg to move amendment no 114 in clause 3 page 2 line 26 leave out \u2018a specified organisation\u2019 and insert\u2018an organisation which is prescribed under schedule 2 of the terrorism act 2000\u2019", " under the bill applicants are disqualified from being awarded a certificate if they support a specified organisation to make the bill consistent with other legislation we propose to amend it so that people involved with proscribed organisations are disqualified if people are to be set free and effectively given a pardon for their crimes the least we can ask for is that they are no longer involved with criminality\u2014at all", " the point is that\u2014interruption", " i beg the minister\u2019s pardon i understood that the ira was no longer active and that it was giving up completely that is what we have been told and that is the basis of the progress we are supposed to be making", " in a moment is the minister happy for somebody to return to this country to be given a certificate\u2014a getoutofjailfree card\u2014and for them to rejoin the ira", " that is not the case the bill says that\u201cthe applicant does not support a specified organisation\u201dpresumably when the individual makes his application he can put in a letter of resignation to the ira although i do not know how these things work interruption that seems to me to be \u00a0 straightforward i cannot see how this amendment can be resisted surely the minister cannot be saying that he is happy for someone who is an active ira member to get one of these getoutofjailfree cards i cannot understand how anybody can propose that that should be the case the people who benefit from this scheme should not belong to a proscribed organisationthe ira is illegal under schedule 2 of the terrorism act 2000 section 12 states\u201ca person commits an offence if\u2014ahe invites support for a proscribed organisation\u201din respect of uniforms and proscribed organisations section 13 states\u201ca person in a public place commits an offence if he\u2014awears an item of clothing\u201dfor example the point i am making is that that is illegal activityif we are going to give these benefits to such people who return to this country\u2014if they are not already in the country\u2014the victims are surely entitled to expect them to have given up all commitment to and certainly any criminality linked with such paramilitary organisations after all those are the very organisations that caused the problems in the first place are we really saying that such people can do everything they have and then come back to receive a complete amnesty\u2014i am sorry if the minister finds that term objectionable\u2014and carry on in the very organisation that has killed so many people that is outrageousit might be the case that in recent years people have not been arrested for belonging to the ira but they certainly should have been they are breaking the law in my view just prohibiting people from belonging to specified organisations if they are to be awarded a certificate is not enough the victims have a right to know that if these people are to be allowed to return to the streets of northern ireland they will not engage in any form of paramilitary activity the ira is an illegal paramilitary organisation and no one who is to benefit from the considerable concessions in this bill should be allowed to cause further hurt to those they have previously terrorised by being allowed to rejoin the ira\u2014or any other illegal organisation including those on the socalled loyalist sideis it really okay for people given a licence under this legislation to rejoin the ira or any similar illegal organisation as one of my hon friends said earlier that would boost the membership of those organisations yet again we do not know how many such people are on the run my hon friend the member for bournemouth east asked the question how many people are we talking about we do not know if we do not know how many we are talking about and if it is quite all right to rejoin the ira we do not know to what extent that organisation will be strengthenedthe ira has not disbanded it has not given up its criminal activity it is still involved in that\u2014as far as i know the government are still blaming the ira for the recent major bank robbery how can we give these \u00a0 benefits to such people only to watch them rejoin the organisations that caused the problems and the terror in the first place", " the minister says that he cannot anticipate what the circumstances will be in three or four years is that not the very point that we made about the emergency provisions\u2014the diplock court\u2014which are time limited what is the distinction what is the difference between the two he can anticipate what the security situation will be yet we cannot anticipate what this situation will be i do not understand the difference", " why the difference", " the conservatives share the concerns expressed by the hon member for belfast south and we support amendment no 117 which \u00a0 would effectively be a sunset clause requiring applicants to make their application within six months of the bill being enacted and coming into forcethe government have said on many occasions that they want closure on this issue which is their stated reason for introducing the bill i suppose that in introducing a date we would be going along with that and saying \u201clet\u2019s have closure\u201d we are talking about a sixmonth period for an application to be made not the end of the tribunal proceedings it is reasonable to set a time limit for the reasons given by the hon member for belfast south which i do not intend to repeatwe support the amendment and have tabled our own there is also an amendment in the group stating that there should be a 12month time scale we would prefer six months but i understand where the hon member for solihull is coming from we would not be diametrically opposed to a 12month limit but we want the matter brought to a conclusion rather than running on because we are most concerned about the victims who have had terrible crimes committed against them or their loved ones we do not want that agony to drag onwe support the amendment proposed by the hon member for belfast south and we commend our amendment no 117 to the committee", " i am grateful to the minister and my hon friend for giving waythe minister did not quite answer the question on human rights has he had a chance to discuss the bill with the new commissioner for human rights who was hardly a unionist appointment i know that she has expressed some concern that some aspects of the bill are not human rightscompliant", " i thank the minister for his responses i will be brief because we have discussed this matter at lengthamendment no 112 would delete \u201cmust\u201d and insert \u201cmay\u201d and i accept the minister\u2019s explanation in that respect as i can his answer on amendment no 113 which questions why the date of 1 november is stated in the legislation the minister also gave a reasonable response to amendment no 116on amendment no 115 however the minister did not satisfactorily explain why we cannot add the condition that senior police officers do not believe that applicants will be a danger in society that is a reasonable request it is also reasonable to ask for the clause to be consistent with other recent terrorist legislation we did not press for the measure on glorification of terrorism to be included in the terrorism bill the government did that amendment will come up for a decision at the end of our debates on clause 3 and i will press it to a division because i am not satisfied by the minister\u2019s responsei beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs how many a byways and b bridleways have

certificate\u201d to \u201cmay award a certificate\u201d which would give the commissioner a little flexibility as to whether to award that certificate to an applicant the word \u201cmay\u201d would be less prescriptive and would allow for greater discretion on the part of the commissioner than \u201cmust\u201d which makes the granting of a certificate binding in all circumstances if the applicant appears to qualify although the requirement would appear to have been met by the applicant the commissioner should have some flexibility especially as there is already an appeals procedure which is detailed in clause 12 the amendment seeks to introduce that flexibilityamendment no 113 relates to subsection 2ai which refers to an applicant\u2019s qualifying for a certificate if members of the police service of northern ireland have\u201cand have had since before 1 november 2005 reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant to be guilty of an offence\u201dto which the bill applies and if he\u201cwould have been arrested for that offence before that date but for the fact that he was believed to be outside the united kingdom\u201dthe reason for the amendment is that we were wondering why that date was chosen what is significant about it we do not believe in the bill at all but if it is to be introduced it should have a sunset clause and i shall propose six months in a later amendment if we are to go down this road at all it seems to us that the eligibility should run from the end date rather than the arbitrary date of 1 november can the minister explain why any date and that date in particular should have been chosenamendment no 115 would add to the list of conditions that have to be fulfilled before the applicant can be granted a licence in addition to those in the bill i propose that applicants should be granted a certificate only if they would not in the opinion of a senior member of the psni be a danger to the public would not be engaged or likely to be engaged in the indirect incitement or glorification of acts of terrorism and would not be likely to be concerned in any aspects of criminalityi shall briefly take each point in turn it must surely be right that the applicant should not be seen by the police as a danger to the public indeed clause 10 accepts that the licence should be awarded only if in \u00a0 the case of those serving life sentences they are not seen as a danger to the public why is there that differencea number of processes are running in parallel as i said on second reading the emergency provisions are due to come to an end in 2007 or at the latest 2008 the assembly elections are due in 2007 and the bill if it becomes an act will probably be up and running by 2007 in the minister\u2019s estimation as the bill has the potential to return a number of people who have been a menace to the streets of northern ireland back to those streets at a time when the emergency provisions could have been scrapped we risk destabilising the streets if we are not careful i do not think that that would be the government\u2019s intentionis it not important that the police do not see such people as a danger to members of the public especially those whom they have previously terrorised it seems a minimal provision and is consistent with the northern ireland sentences act 1998 where the fourth condition to be satisfied before being eligible for release is that the person would not be a danger to the publici would not propose the incitement and glorification amendment other than for the sake of consistency with the bills recently introduced by the government i would have thought that they would accept the amendment with open arms after all one terrorist is as bad as another it is surely wrong to prohibit members of alqaeda from glorifying terrorism on the mainland while allowing ira or uvf supporters to carry out the glorification of terrorism in northern ireland we all said in early stages of this bill and the terrorism northern ireland bill which completed its passage through the commons last week that we want to see northern ireland returned to normality normality also means commonality in this respect so in order to be keeping with other terrorist legislation perhaps it is important to prohibit inciting and glorifying terrorism in northern irelandthe third aspect of the amendment is designed to ensure that the applicant is not and does not become engaged in criminality we have heard over many years in this house and outside that northern ireland has become a different place since the belfast agreement and that paramilitary activity has been reduced as have murders and other forms of paramilitary violence however from the outset i would say that far too much paramilitary violence has continued since that agreement i would also draw the committee\u2019s attention to the last imc report which states that the uvf remains \u201cactive violent and ruthless\u201d that there are unreported acts of intimidation that are far more numerous than acts of violence and that the criminals are flexible and resilientthe nature of the violence may have changed but the mafiastyle criminality remains it is right that it cannot be allowed to continue on either side of the divide there can be little doubt that republicans are involved in criminality whether that is through protection rackets bank robberies extortion or whatever there is certainly no doubt in my mind that \u00a0 the socalled loyalist paramilitaries are deeply involved too on that basis it is difficult to see how the amendment can be resisted for northern ireland to return to normality surely those reentering society cannot be involved in any form of criminality but must have truly repented their sins and pledged to live decently and honestly in the future involvement in criminality can form no part of their future or that of northern irelandfinally i shall address amendment no 116 the bill requires a senior police officer to write to the commissioner to state that he believes that an applicant qualifies to be dealt with under the scheme the amendment would require the officer to consult the imc the northern ireland victims commissioner and the nihrc before making that statement the purpose of the amendment is again to keep the victim at the heart of the process and is totally consistent with the other amendments that we have tabled", " this will be the final time that i intervene on this matter when the applicant applies for a certificate two conditions that must be met before it is granted are that he\u201cdoes not support a specified organisation\u201dand\u201cthat he is not concerned or likely to be concerned in the commission preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism\u201d might not the victim be able to provide some useful evidence in that respect", " the minister says that when the certificate is granted the person will have been charged is that entirely correct clause 32ai states that one of the eligibility criteria is that members of the police service of northern ireland\u201chave had since before 1st november 2005 reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant to be guilty of an offence\u201di am not trying to trip the minister up but in his view is that the same as being charged", " i am glad that we cleared that up the minister says that at that point there will be reasonable grounds for believing that a person has committed the offence surely if someone makes an application he has reasonable grounds for believing that he committed the offence", " but we are not talking about being charged i just said that", " i welcome you to the committee mr taylor i have worked with you before it was a privilege to do so then and it is todayi shall go through the amendments briefly amendment no 154 would remove \u201cis granted\u201d and insert \u201capplies for\u201d when referring to a certificate of eligibility as the minister knows the bill has caused hurt heartache anxiety and fear in northern ireland the words are disputed but it proposes an effective amnesty for people who have committed the most awful crimes some of which were described movingly on second reading especially by the hon members for south antrim dr mccrea and for belfast east mr robinsonit is bad enough that those found guilty of such offences will not even have to serve a single day in prison they will not even have to carry out anything such as community service nor will they even have to appear in court indeed there will not be a court nor will they even have to apply for a certificate of freedom themselves someone else can do that for them those people will not touch the criminal justice system but will be dealt with at arm\u2019s lengthi am worried about the victims and their relatives several of whom have travelled to the house of commons to meet the prime minister the secretary of state and many others including some members of the committee they are hurt and angry if they cannot obtain justice under the bill\u2014some of us will try to amend it so that they obtain a degree of justice\u2014we should at the very least keep them informed of what is going on lack of knowledge of what is happening can so often make matters worse for the victimswe need to ensure that the victims are involved in the process and that means involvement from the start they should be given information when an application is made for a certificate not when that certificate is granted if they are not given the information until the certificate is granted they will in effect have been excluded from the entire process the victims might not want to become involved or to use the information at all but the amendment would give them the opportunity to become involved at the start or part way through the process if they so wish it is consistent with amendments that other hon members have tabled which involve the northern ireland victims and human rights commissionersamendment no 155 would require the commissioner to consult\u201cand have regard to the view of the northern ireland victims commissioner about arrangements to be made in fulfilling his duties under subparagraph 1\u201dwhich refers to giving information to victims amendment no 156 would allow representations from victims to be made about\u201cthe case of each person who applies for a certificate\u201dand regard to be paid to those views victims would also be given the reasons for granting or refusing to grant a certificate in every caseamendment no 118 would require the commissioner to inform the victims commissioner of the application amendment no 119 would allow for the victims commissioner to make representations to the commissioner about each application amendment no 126 would require the victims commissioner to be informed if a certificate were cancelled under the bill the defendant and the director of public prosecutions for northern ireland are required to be notified but victims are not the amendment would put the victims at the heart of the processamendment no 138 would require the victims commissioner and anyone else the secretary of state considered appropriate to be informed of the suspension of a licence amendment no 139 is a similar proposal amendment no 140 would give the right of appeal to the victims commissioner against the \u00a0 refusal to award or against the cancellation of a licence the bill gives the right of appeal to the person concerned in the case of an application being refused or a licence revoked and to the secretary of state against the granting of a licence again the victim is missing from the process our amendment attempts to put the victim at the heart of the process and to begin to relieve their pain", " they will", " clause 18 on the special prosecutor states\u201cthe secretary of state after consultation with the advocate general for northern ireland must appoint a person to be known as the special prosecutor\u201dthat seems to tie in with the proposal made by the hon member for foyle that the first and deputy first ministers should approve the appointment it seems identical", " i follow the hon lady\u2019s logic but she will be aware from the meeting that she attended that was similar to the one that i attended only yesterday that sinn fein now has serious reservations about the bill", " my point is that it is getting to the stage where all the parties will be opposed to the bill the hon lady may have a different interpretation but if she is suggesting that the dup for example would delay going back into government to prevent the bill from being enacted i suspect that sinn fein may also reach that point based on what i heard yesterday because of its objection to members of the security forces being included in the bill i am not suggesting that this would be the case but if the dup were to delay devolution in order to prevent the bill from becoming an act i am becoming convinced that sinn fein may well attempt to do the same", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department what recent discussions he has had with eu ministers about illegal immigration from north africa into the eu and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for transport what information regarding car registration details the driver and vehicle licensing agency is entitled to provide to vehicle clamping companies and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister how many orders to remove hedges have been made by local councils in a england and b gloucestershire under the antisocial behaviour act 2003 and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister what discussions he has had with local councils about the workings of the high hedges provisions in the antisocial behaviour act 2003 and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister what assessment he made of bus services attending stoke orchard gloucestershire when objecting to this aspect of tewkesbury borough councils local plan and if he will make a statement", " i rise to support the amendment i too consider it to be very important because the seriousness of the offences that we are talking about causes the greatest degree of offence the knowledge that people who are accused will not have to appear before a court\u2014indeed there will not be a court\u2014is very offensive but the approach to the seriousness of their offences is among the most offensive parts of the bill i support the amendment because if it were accepted it would to some extent reduce the level of offence and hurt caused by the billthe hon member for solihull put her case very reasonably she might want to rephrase her term \u201cdraw a line\u201d but she was talking about what the secretary of state referred to as the endgame or closure i too want reconciliation on second reading i mentioned my participation in a parliamentary visit to rwanda which suffered the most terrible genocide in 1994 when 850000 people \u00a0 were massacred i and other hon members literally walked through the skulls and bones of the victims\u2014a harrowing experience as the committee will imagine then we went to the courts that had been set up especially to bring about justice the point of the analogy is that the justice minister said to me \u201cthis is the first step towards reconciliation without justice we cannot have reconciliation\u201d many people in northern ireland will not be able to be reconciled if they see so many people who have committed the most terrible offences going free without even having to appear in a court\u2014without there even being a courti do not want the committee to take this the wrong way but the fact that so many of the people to whom we are referring are from one side of the divide\u2014the republican side\u2014makes matters worse it makes reconciliation more difficult let me repeat clearly what i have said in the house i totally condemn violence on both sides i have condemned certain members of the orange order who apparently took part in the violence last summer however it is not helpful that most of those who will benefit from the legislation\u2014albeit it is available people from both sides\u2014are from one sidethere has to be justice before there can be reconciliation those who have committed the most awful crimes should not benefit from the process and i have no hesitation in supporting the amendment proposed by the hon member for belfast east", " i am grateful to the minister for giving way and i appreciate his sensitive approach to the situation but i am afraid that the secretary of state has used the words \u201cclosure\u201d and \u201cendgame\u201d on very many occasions", " we have had a long debate about this but it is important because it defines what kind of offence is covered by the bill with all due respect to the minister\u2014i mean that sincerely\u2014i am not satisfied with his explanation i have two objections first the drafting of clause 11a is very poor it says\u201cin connection with terrorism and the affairs of northern ireland whether committed for terrorist purposes or not\u201dthe bit in brackets presumably just relates to the affairs of northern ireland because terrorism cannot be for \u201cterrorist purposes or not\u201d if it is both terrorism and the affairs of northern ireland perhaps they should have been dealt with in separate subsections it does not read correctly as it iswe heard earlier that the phrase\u201cwhether committed for terrorist purposes or not\u201ddoes not appear in the terrorism act 2000 as the hon member for montgomeryshire said the definition of terrorism in that act is pretty comprehensive and possibly too wide when i first spoke on the subject some hours ago i said that terrorism is defined quite widely in the 2000 act and my concern was that the phrase in clause 11a makes it much wider particularly given the extra activities that paramilitary organisations are now undertaking the parameters are getting wider and i am concerned that the commissioner will be able to issue certificates for a wider range of offences than parliament intended that is my second objectionthe minister spoke of interpretation i am not a lawyer but i am aware that there are different rules for interpreting acts of parliament including the mischief rule the golden rule and the literal rule how can we be sure which of those will be adopted by the commissioner we are talking not about a court but about a commissioner i have deep concerns about thatthe hon member for montgomeryshire wondered whether the amendment was consistent with the new clause tabled by the democratic unionist party i think it is although they focus on slightly separate issues the amendment would confine the provision to terrorist acts whereas the new clause raises the separate question of the security forces i do not see \u00a0 that the two are contradictory if the security forces are involved in suppressing terrorism i see no inconsistency with the amendmenti do not want to take any more of the committee\u2019s time we have had a long debate\u2014necessarily so i am not convinced by the minister\u2019s response like the hon member for montgomeryshire i do not blame the minister i am convinced that he has been let down by the advice that he has received i do not like to criticise people who cannot answer back but we have a job to do i have expressed my feelings and i shall press the amendment to a division", " i am glad that the minister made the point about the difference between specified organisations and proscribed organisations surely in doing that however he has put his finger on the very point that the hon member for east antrim made if those women belong to the ira they will qualify for the schememr hansonindicated dissent", " i did not say that they would obtain the certificate i said that they would qualify for the scheme even though they are members of an illegal organisation and have committed a barbaric act they would not qualify for the scheme if they belonged to a specified organisation which is a point to which we can return as it is particularly relevant when we are trying to define what acts will be covered by the bill", " i seek further clarification the minister refers to paragraph 9 of schedule 9 of the 2000 act but does not that refer only to escape offences", " that is what the bill says", " with respect to the minister this act is what will be applied this is the act that the certification commissioner will look at if and when\u2014in the unfortunate circumstances\u2014it becomes an act it refers to an offence specified in paragraph 9 of schedule 9 of the 2000 act as \u201cescape offences\u201d not to all offences", " the minister is being extremely accommodating it will not have escaped your attention sir nicholas that in moving the amendment i made the shortest speech of all that have been made this morning but i did refer to the definition of terrorism under the 2000 act we accept that as far as it goes but the 2000 act does not as far as i can see include the phrase\u201cwhether committed for terrorist purposes or not\u201dthat is the point of the amendment the clause refers specifically to the 2000 act but paragraph 9 of schedule 9 to that act refers to prison offences under the prison act northern ireland 1953 not to the whole lot that is very specific", " i am grateful to the minister for giving way i am sure he accepts that parliament did not authorise any agreement to be made nor can parliament by bound by that agreement as we are at the start of our discussions in committee i should say that i hope he will not use the fact that an agreement has been made as a reason for tabling any amendments that may be coming forward", " does the hon gentleman agree that as the parameters for paramilitary activity appear to be broadening it is particularly important to strike out that phrase", " it is not especially relevant to the amendment that i moved but the hon gentleman obviously feels strongly about these matters everyone does however it is clause 51b that draws a line under inquiries have already been undertaken does the hon gentleman accept that it is not so much what is proposed in the amendment that is objectionable but what is proposed in the bill", " i echo the words of hon member for lagan valley if such individuals are involved in collusion that is terrorist activity not antiterrorist activity", " i beg to move amendment no 111 in clause 1 page 1 line 6 leave out\u2018whether committed for terrorist purposes or not\u2019", " the amendment deals with identifying the offences to which the bill applies the terrorism act 2000 gives quite a wide definition of terrorism under that act terrorism is action that\u201cinvolves serious violence against a person  involves serious damage to property  endangers a person\u2019s life other than that of the person committing the action  creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public or  is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system\u201daccording to the bill\u201can offence is one to which this act applies if it is  an offence under the law of any part of the united kingdom committed before 10th april 1998 in connection with terrorism and the affairs of northern ireland\u201dbut then it adds\u201cwhether committed for terrorist purposes or not\u201dthat seems to be a slightly strange phrase the original definition of terrorism is wide but that phrase makes it even wider and seems to create the potential to include most crimes if they are committed in connection with the affairs of northern ireland even though they may not be committed for terrorist purposes that is far too wide all manner of offences could be included provided that they were committed in connection with the affairs of northern ireland i am sure it is not the intention of the government for this bill to cover all offences that would mean if taken to its logical conclusion that every single offender would have the potential to escape punishment regardless of what they did", " i suggest the bill is so shameful that they did not want to print too many copies of itas i was saying i am sure it is not the minister\u2019s intention that every single offender could escape punishment regardless of what they did i should be grateful if the minister told the committee the precise purpose of including the phrase\u201cwhether committed for purposes of terrorism or not\u201din the bill", " i too welcome you to the chair sir nicholas i have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship before it was an agreeable experience and i am sure that today will be similari thank the minister for his accommodating approach he understands that this is a difficult bill and he is being as flexible as possible within the constraints placed on us by the house of commons as i have said privately to him we are about to discuss an emotional and difficult subject and any comments that i make will be about the bill itself and are not intended to be personal remarks about him or anyone elseit is good to see that the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik is serving on the committee he has shown remarkable courage and dedication to duty in the past couple of weeks i pay tribute to him i know that he will contribute greatly to the debate i also welcome my party colleagues to the committee debating the bill will be a harrowing experience but an experience none the less i also thank the clerk mr sandell for his help in respect of tabling amendmentswe are generally opposed in principle to the concept of programming and we frequently vote against programme motions in the house but in this instance the motion has already been agreed and we feel that there will be adequate time to consider the bill in its entirety given that and the minister\u2019s flexible approach i have no objection to the programme motion", "to ask the secretary of state for transport what offence is committed if someone wrongly takes advantage of the blue badge scheme on private land and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for transport what steps he is taking to reduce car accidents involving people between the ages of 17 and 24 years and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister what plans he has to allow local councils to revalue properties which have been extended for the purpose of calculating council tax and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of statefor foreign and commonwealth affairs what funding is being provided by the eu to build a tunnel between morocco and spain and if he will make a statement", "if he will make a statement on his proposals to merge police forces in the southwest of england", "i thank the minister for that answer but i suspect that the whole house believes that decisions have already been taken on this issue i am glad that she is going to listen to the consultation because in gloucestershire the chief constable the police authority the county council each of the six local authorities and thousands of people across the area totally oppose the proposed mergers gloucestershire has a very good record in tackling level 2 crime and we should remember the infamous west case and the biggest legal aid fraud case in the country why does the minister feel that all those people are wrong and that she is right", "only last week we heard about another food crisis in africa this time in the republic of niger i support emergency aid and debt relief but we have to move things on with reforms of tariff barriers and export subsidies will the secretary of state ask his friends in the eu this as the common agricultural policy has driven our farmers to near bankruptcy made the british housewife pay more for food than she needs to and is damaging the third world exactly who is it helping", "i begin by returning my thanks to the minister for the way in which he has dealt with the bill i raised a couple of issues in committee which by their detailed nature required him to write to me and he duly did explaining the situation fully as a result i did not pursue the matters furtheri think that i can speak for a number of hon members when i say that there is some confusion about how the government assess the situation in northern ireland on the one hand we have the ontheruns legislation which suggests that the bad situation that we have had in northern ireland for so very long is coming to an end on the other hand we have bills such as this which by their very introduction would suggest that the situation in northern ireland is not as it should bethe opposition regret the need to introduce the bill we wish that we had normality in the province on every occasion i have visited the province over many years it has been made clear that one of the very things that people want is to be treated normally both politically and with regard to the security situation however we accept that it is not possible at the moment to move towards thatas a number of hon members have said particularly those from the dup there is great concern at the fact that the violence continues the nature of the violence has changed but the violence continues i quoted the recent imc report in committee and i shall quote it againthe involvement of paramilitaries in organised crime goes deepthat is a great concern the report continueswe have concluded that because of this paramilitary involvement organised crime is the biggest long term threat to the rule of law in northern ireland    the criminals are flexible and resilientthose words are sufficient to chill most people such comments are very worrying and i think that they persuaded dup members to press their amendment which suggested that the provisions of the terrorism act should be extended not only to 2008 but to 2012", "my hon friend is right that the situation involves violence of all kinds and criminality on all sides a week or two ago the uvf was specified by statutory instrument which is not the sort of progress that we want my hon friend is also right to mention the involvement of the mainstream\u2014if that is the right word\u2014paramilitary groupsconservative members accept that in some ways the situation in northern ireland is greatly improved we welcomed the first ira statement and the statement suggesting that all ira arms have been put beyond use as i said last week however we are worried about a number of aspects of the process we are worried because we are yet to hear whether the proceeds of the northern bank raid have been put beyond use what has happened to that money it is my understanding which i think that the secretary of state confirmed from a sedentary position last week that the government continue to hold the ira responsible for the northern bank raid i think that the minister is nodding\u2014it is very gentle but i think that he is nodding i understand that the irish government and the police in northern ireland still hold the ira responsible for that bank raid although the iras present arms may have been put beyond use\u2014i have been assured that a substantial quantity of arms has been put beyond use\u2014where has the money gone from the northern bank robbery is it not possible that further arms will be bought", "i thought that i was doing so but i accept your guidance madam deputy speakeri agree with the government on the case for the bill because the situation in northern ireland is not normal or even close to normal i would have liked the bill to be extended to 2012 as has been proposed i have already mentioned the fact that some conservative members have a theory about the 2007 or 2008 deadline\u2014in my notes deadline is in inverted commas because it is not an official term\u2014because a number of things could culminate in 2007 or 2008 if the northern ireland offences bill were to get through parliament\u2014in its present state i am not convinced that it will and hope that it does not\u2014people who were previously involved in terrorism and who may not be within the jurisdiction of the united kingdom would return to the streets of belfast and wider areas of northern ireland the emergency measures that we are discussing could end in 2007 or 2008 although it is not for me to speculate the prime minister could be planning to retire then having wrapped up the whole issue of northern ireland in terms of special measuresif this proves to be appropriate because it reflects the improved situation in northern ireland by that time i will be as pleased as anybody but that may not be the case i hope that it will but i am not persuaded i would have preferred the government to accept the facility to extend the legislation proposed in amendment no 1 the amendment that i tabled in committee would have extended the legislation on an annual basis but the government were not prepared to accept that either i wish that they had because we would have felt more secure that the special provisions would remain in placethe minister said that if the government judge in 2007 or 2008 that the situation in northern ireland is not normal they will take action given the other things that will be happening in 2007 and 2008 including new assembly elections i am not sure whether they would introduce the necessary legislation at that point but i do not want to drive the nails out of sight on that matterconservative members deeply regret that the situation in northern ireland is not such that this bill can be done away with but we accept that it is necessary that is why we have supported the government on second reading in committee and here today", "does the hon gentleman share my concern as i alluded to the 2007\u201308 deadline that because of the introduction of the other bill which we are considering in committee next week an awful lot of people who were previously involved in terrorism might be living back in northern ireland by that time does not that make the situation in 2007\u201308 potentially worse not better", "the minister is attempting to explain the reason for the 2008 deadline i shall quote from the last imc report it is right that the numbers of certain crimes have fallen and we welcome that but the report sayswe have concluded that because of this paramilitary involvement organised crime is the biggest longterm threat to the rule of law in northern irelandthe words long term perhaps explain why opposition members are concerned with the 2008 deadline", "we discussed this matter in committee it was probably the longest discussion that we had indeed i tabled a similar amendment to this one at that stage while i have every respect for the points made by the hon members for belfast south dr mcdonnell for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik and for solihull lorely burt the official opposition probably have a little more sympathy with the points made by dup membersas we shall probably discuss more on third reading we want to see a return to a normal society in northern ireland i do not want to add to what has already been said but i want to express my concern about the fact that the provisions will end in 2008 at the latest and possibly even in 2007 there is a theory about the 2007\u201308 deadline given the possible retirement of the prime minister before the next general election in 2009 or 2010\u2014a matter that we discussed at prime ministers questions\u2014the conservatives are worried that he might want to rush certain things forward the northern ireland offences bill has been introduced further assembly elections could take place in northern ireland in 2007 and the provisions in this bill could come to an end in 2007 or 2008 everything would fall together rather too neatly if that is okay if it is right that everything should fall together neatly in 2007 or 2008 i will be the first to welcome that however i am not persuaded that we are anywhere near that situation yet for that reason if the amendment is pressed to a vote the official opposition will support it", "we discussed this matter in committee the official opposition have some sympathy with the point made by the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik and we have had various discussions about iti raised the point about unanimity in committee although we did not discuss it much at that stage we can see some difficulty with it if there was a requirement for unanimity and there was a twotoone vote in favour of the guilt of the person before the court the majority verdict would obviously be guilty but the person would presumably be released if there were no requirement for unanimity i foresee further problems if there was a twotoone vote there might be questions about which judge voted which way were they unionist loyalist nationalist protestant or catholicthe initial appointment of the judges could also lead to difficulties the number three does not divide equally which is why it was chosen", "indeeda further problem could arise if one judge was a protestant and the second a catholic how would the third appointment be made", "i cannot possibly respondthere could be an argument for considering the background of the judges but the current system seems to be working reasonably well in practice although i accept that trial without jury is wholly undesirable it is acceptable\u2014if that is the right word\u2014only due to the difficulties in northern ireland which unfortunately continue to existthe situation is working acceptably partly because it has as a backstop the automatic right to appeal leave to appeal does not have to be sought there is an automatic right of appeal in the present system so although i promise the hon member for montgomeryshire that the official opposition have looked at the new clause and discussed it in great detail we have decided on balance that we cannot support it", "to ask the prime minister if he will consider recommending the granting of a state funeral to the last person to die who served in the first world war and if he will make a statement", "i am a smoker but i consider myself to be a very considerate smoker i would not smoke in someone elses house car or office or near anyone who was having a meal it is because i have that consideration for others that i find the parts of the bill that relate to smoking totally objectionable i agree with my right hon friend the member for northwest hampshire sir george young when he suggested that it would impinge on his liberty if someone elses cigarette smoke reached his nose i entirely agree with that and there is no reason why the rights of smokers and nonsmokers cannot be accommodated the hon member for sunderland north bill etherington mentioned extractor units which can be installed in pubs and can do a very good job we live in a society in which people can make choicesmany hon members have quoted figures relating to the number of people who want smoking to be banned in pubs i think that those figures are probably exaggerated but if we accept that they are right and if there is such a large demand for nonsmoking pubs and restaurants the market will deliver those places as it will in any other line of business we will then end up with pubs in which people can smoke and have a meal and pubs in which people do not smoke we will also have pubs in which smoking is possible in some areas and banned in others in those circumstances it seems to me that everybody would be happythe government however make a play of protecting staff in todays debate nobody has asked how many people behind the bar of pubs smoke themselves i have asked the minister a parliamentary question about that and the government have not carried out such a survey we are therefore trying to protect people from smoke who in many cases already smokei also draw an analogy with people going down coal mines i understand that there are 400000 outstanding claims by miners or their families relating to people injured in coal mines many of whom have died already i do not know of a proposal to stop people going down coal mines however when i raised the issue with the hon member for northavon steve webb he said that it is not necessary for people to smoke in pubs but it is necessary for people to work down coal mines\u2014i paraphrase him but i think that that it is what he said that is not true people do not have to work down coal mines\u2014we do not have to generate electricity through burning coal as there are many other ways of doing so", "for goodness sake i do not think that it is possible to go down a coal mine and discover it to be a very healthy working environmentthe government say that the ban is about protecting the health of people who work behind bars and i accept that their health should be protected but there are many licensed premises and a great shortage of catering staff which is why so many illegal immigrants are employed in catering surely if there are different kinds of pubs and restaurants bar and restaurant staff can find employment in those that suit themas many members have mentioned if we take the assertion that staff are the primary concern a step further how can it be right to expose some people in some pubs to smoke and yet say that in other pubs where food is served people will be protected from a smoky atmosphere that defies logic it is nothing to do with liberty we know why the government have adopted this position\u2014because the cabinet could not agree everybody would have more respect for the government were they just to admit that it is absolute nonsense to suggest that they are protecting some peoples libertyif we are talking about protecting staff in pubs as we should i will mention my pub\u2014i do not own it but i go in it as it is in my village it is the village inn in twyning if anyone wants to look it up and it is a fine establishment the landlord and his wife run it they both smoke and they do not employ any staff how does the governments logic stack up in that case the pub serves food\u2014it has a very small menu as it is a country pub if the ban goes through let us say that the pub stops serving food as i think that it would because many people in that pub smoke if the landlord chooses not to serve food so that we can continue to go in his premises and smoke will i be banned from personally requesting a meal will i be stopped from going to the landlady and saying i am aware that you smoke that your husband smokes and that it is a smoky atmosphere but i want to exercise my choice to have a meal if i have a meal prepared at home it is prepared in a smoky atmosphere why cannot i exercise that choice why should that choice be denied to me it is ridiculous", "the hon gentleman has made his point if he will forgive me i shall not respond to it in detail because there is not enough timeif the government are serious about stopping people smoking which i do not doubt and if smoking is so bad for us which i do not doubt either why do they not ban smoking altogether there is a oneword answer tax we have heard from a number of members how much smokers cost the national health service by means of a parliamentary question i established that not much research is done on whether those admitted to hospital are smokers let us however accept what the minister told me in a separate answer\u2014that the estimated cost of smokingrelated diseases to the nhs is \u00a318 billion a year that is a lot of money but we should also bear in mind that smokers put \u00a381 billion a year into the exchequer\u2014more than four times as much that is why i cannot see the bill as anything other than a load of confusion and rather hypocritical", "i am listening carefully to the hon gentleman as i do to all his speeches however if we were to follow his point to its logical conclusion we could not allow people to work down coal mines i am not aware that the government are going to introduce a ban on that", "did my hon friend discuss secondary smoking with the previous health secretary who said that if smoking were banned in most pubs\u2014as it will be because most pubs serve food\u2014people would be likely to stay at home to have a drink and smoke that is exactly where their children are people have a choice whether to go into a pub but children do not have a choice about breathing in smoke at home", "on a point of order mr deputy speaker the secretary of state keeps referring to the fact that licensed premises will be exempt is she aware that these days almost every pub serves food so\u2014", "to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if he will establish a system of tax credits similar to that used in the united states to encourage

the bill perhaps i can be allowed to stray for a moment to speak of the courage of the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik his must have been a very difficult speech to make but he made it with his usual commitment to the issue he will take this in the spirit in which i mean it he has far more friends in this place than his modesty would allow him to think i know that he will also take this in the spirit in which i mean it he is a man with a great sense of humour and his great strength of character will allow him to come through these difficult times every member looks forward to the eventual return of the humour for which he is well known he is a great member of parliamentthis has been a very passionate debate i have been in the house for only eight years but i cannot think of a time when i have seen the government under so much fire from every corner of it we heard a very effective speech from the former secretary of state the right hon member for torfaen mr murphy who says that he hopes the government will consider serious amendments to the bill and will consider other people rather than just republicans i think that i quote him accuratelythe hon member for foyle mark durkan said that the bill undermined assurances given about prisoners during the agreement referendum campaign he also made the important point that loyalist terrorists have not decommissioned yet they will benefit from the billthe right hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley spoke with his usual passion he fairly said that the bill introduces two systems of justice in northern ireland but i suspect that he would accept that one of those systems is not justice at allas usual the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey spoke extremely well she pointed out that in opposition the labour party did not always support antiterrorism legislation she asked why if the ira is no longer a threat we need the billmy right hon friend the member for east hampshire mr mates said that there are too many concessions in the bill and that they all point one way he provided a moving personal account of the difficulties that he had faced in one instance as a minister he argued that the bill might well lead to ministers having to take more difficult decisions perhaps compromising victims rights time and againthe hon member for hackney south and shoreditch meg hillier expressed great concern about the lack of any deadline in the bill and the absence of any need for the accused to appear in courtthe hon member for belfast east mr robinson spoke about the great injustices of the bill he rightly pointed out that because of the limit on the amount of evidence that can be gathered it assists in the achievement of nonguilty verdicts by the accused he spoke movingly about the events that propelled him into politics which are highly relevant to the issues surrounding the billeven the hon member for ochil and south perthshire gordon banks\u2014i shall be kinder than others about him\u2014expressed concern about the fact that the accused do not have to appear in court and about the ability of the court to subpoena witnesses but not those who are accusedmy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack reminded us in a wideranging speech that the people that we are talking about in the context of the bill are just as evil as those who bombed london he provided a good analogy when he said that ontherun mass murderers and terrorists from bosnia would not be given a certificate for freedomthe hon member for belfast south dr mcdonnell spoke about the need to provide victims with justice and truth indeed he felt that the bill lets those victims downthe hon member for north down lady hermon expressed shame at the government for introducing the bill and my right hon friend the member for bracknell mr mackay appropriately asked exactly what deal was done at weston parkthe hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson spoke about the real hurt caused in northern ireland by the bill he pointed out that the government said only a week ago that opposition members should have listened to police officers in respect of proposals for 90 days yet police officers are clearly being ignored in respect of this billmy hon friend the member for blaby mr    robathan who along with some other colleagues served in northern ireland made a hardhitting speech he condemned the concessions that it seems the government are makingit is important to ask why we need the bill the government have not provided the answer to that question who is the bill for it is certainly not for the victims who do not want it the only political party in favour of the bill is sinn fein it is rather alarming that the government are prepared to negotiate with sinn fein but will not negotiate with constitutional parties about amendments to the bill the secretary of state said that there was an agreement with the irish government but they are certainly not implementing the terms of the billas hon members have already asked what will result if the bill is defeated let us suppose that it does not get through parliament what are the government afraid will happen the government say that they believe the ira when it says that the war is over that leads me to the question of why the bill should be introduced now if the war is perhaps not over is not the bill prematurewe have heard the ira statement and subsequent confirmation that the ira has put its arms beyond use but i am not aware that it has put the proceeds of the bank robbery beyond use as far as i know the government still hold the ira responsible for that robbery as do the irish government and the police in northern ireland while the ira has the means to rearm and to pay its volunteers is not the bill at least prematurethe secretary of state spoke about closure\u2014what he described in his article in the times yesterday as the end game the good friday agreement makes it clear that its participants believe that the aims of the criminal justice system should be tohave the confidence of all parts of the communityi do not think that we can say that this bill has the confidence of all parts of the community when it comes to the socalled justice that it will deliveri shall give a very brief analogy a few years ago i and some other hon members visited rwanda where there had been the most awful genocide i walked through the bones and skulls of some of the victims of that genocide and then attended one of the court sessions about 850000 people had been massacred and i said to the justice minister we have all these courts set up and we are going to send people to prison yet we are talking about reconciliation can we get the reconciliation if we go down that pathwhat a naive question for me to ask the justice minister said we have to have the justice before we can have the reconciliation that is the point that hon members of all parties have tried to make todaythe secretary of state said that we can never bring an end to the victims hurt that may be true but we can make that hurt worse i suspect that that is what the bill will dothe secretary of state did not help the process with his article in the times he wrote that those returning would face the prospect of a full legal process but that is untrue as they will not have to appear in court he added that they would have to go through a special court before being let out on licence but let out of where let out of what those people will not have been inside for a single day what a misleading article it wasthere is not time for me to go through all the bills flaws as i want to give the minister an appropriate time in which to respond but i will say that i see the bill as yet another concession to the ira as my hon friend the member for blaby asked what will the next concession be what will provoke it will it be that the ira starts to make threatening noises again that is unacceptable in a democracyi do not mean this as a personal comment to the minister but he will not be surprised to hear that we will take this bill very seriously if it reaches committee", "the minister has accused opposition members of scaremongering about the prospect of cuts in the gas supply may i direct him to the comments made by the hon and learned member for north warwickshire mr obrien a former minister

the announcements in written form rather than by coming here to announce the proposals on the floor of the house of commonsyou will be aware mr speaker of the large number of right hon and hon members who take a close interest in the affairs of northern ireland given that the proposals in the written statements are so fundamental and farreaching would it not have been more appropriate for the

into the tote at all the bill that was introduced to sell off the tote had to nationalise it first so no government have ever put any money into the tote if the european commission makes that

easy to sit in england to see northern ireland as a faraway place and to pass legislation that affects them and not us it is important that we do not pass legislation without considering the details closely i hope that we have done thatseveral amendments have been probing amendments but they have raised important issues about the way in which northern ireland is run whenever i have been there i have found that one of the many desires of the province is for normality we are not there yet for the reasons that the minister and others have outlined and repeatedi look forward to the next stage of the bill it is with great regret that we must consider it but consider it we must i hope that we can continue this constructive dialogue on future bills i should not wish to risk being ruled out of order when i suggest that the government ought to continue to enable constructive dialogue the minister understands the legislation to which i refer i do not think i can say any more without being ruled out of ordermay i thank you lady winterton for your chairmanship which i have found to be firm but in the right spirit may i thank also the minister for his sympathetic treatment of the amendments that we tabled i look forward to receiving his detailed explanations of the situations to which we referred and i thank him for the way in which he has dealt with the debate he has been accommodating while putting forward the government\u2019s principles and priorities", " i thank the minister for his explanation which was in accordance with what i understood the situation to be hugely complicated though it is i said that it was a probing amendment and given the minister\u2019s response i should like to look into the matter a little more deeply", " the hon member for broxtowe made a reasonable point as i said this is a probing amendment to test the government\u2019s thinking on the issue i would welcome such a detailed explanation and depending on its contents we could return to the matter on report again i thank the minister for his reasonable response and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " obviously we have considered the option ourselves and taken an interest in it i am not quite sure how the threejudge court would work would they have to be unanimous in their verdict or would a majority verdict suffice", " as i said in my intervention on the hon lady we have some sympathy with her objectives in the sense that her amendment is an attempt to move towards normalisation and one judge sitting alone cannot be considered to be normal but we have some concerns about how the system would workthe intervention was not intended to be awkward it is important to establish how the system would work would the court be similar to the court of appeal where there can be a majority verdict or would the verdict have to be unanimous would there be a problem\u2014some hon members might say that we already have this problem although i do not think so\u2014if one of the three judges had unionist tendencies and one had nationalist tendencies where would the third one come from i foresee some difficulties with thatthe minister will probably give a fuller explanation but the backstop to the present system is the automatic right of appeal which does not exist in the ordinary court system in great britain where permission to appeal must be obtained we do not have a principled objection to the liberal democrats\u2019 proposal but we are concerned about how it would work in practice", " i understand the argument and accept what the hon lady says i was about to wind up by saying that when the minister responds to the hon lady\u2019s reasonable points he could perhaps comment on those that i have raised", " i beg to move amendment no 7 in clause 3 page 3 line 18 at end add\u2014\u20186the secretary of state may by order following consultation with the lord chief justice of northern ireland determine that a specific case falling under a scheduled offence shall be subject to trial by jury7in such a case section 758 of the terrorism act 2000 shall not apply\u2019the amendment follows on from my previous amendments the secretary of state can currently schedule or unschedule offences as i understand the legislation murder for example could be scheduled or unscheduled this is a probing amendment to find out the government\u2019s thoughts in an attempt to bring about greater normalisation the amendment would give the secretary of state the power by order following consultation with the lord chief justice of northern ireland to determine that a specific case within a category can be tried by a jury rather than a single judgethe second part of the amendment states that section 758 of the terrorism act 2000 which is the provision of an automatic right to appeal if a trial is conducted simply by a judge will not apply if the trial were to be conducted by a jury the normal appeal procedures would applyi wondered whether it would be helpful for the secretary of state to have by order the power to specify not only a category of offence\u2014let us say murder is a scheduled offence\u2014but a certain case if he were convinced that for a particular offence in a particular case a jury could be recruited that would not be subject to intimidation and if he were satisfied that a trial could go ahead properly have the government considered introducing such legislation", " i beg to move amendment no 9 in clause 2 page 2 line 24 at end insert\u2014\u2018basection 756 trial on indictment nonscheduled offences\u2019", " the drafting of the amendments is necessarily complicated clause 2 repeals part 7 of the 2000 act and i seek to add a further section of that act to those that are to be repealed it may help the committee if i read out section 756 to which my amendments refer it states\u201cwithout prejudice to subsection 2 where the court trying a scheduled offence on indictment\u2014ais not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence butbis satisfied that he is guilty of a nonscheduled offence of which a jury could have found him guilty on a trial for the scheduled offence the court may convict him of the nonscheduled offence\u201dthis is a probing amendment the spirit of which is important because the legislation contains a series of scheduled offences that can be tried without a jury and by a judge sitting alone that is unsatisfactory and should be limited to offences where it is necessary i am a little concerned about this part of the legislation it would be possible to go through the whole of part 7 of the 2000 act and pull it to pieces but that is not why we are here however i was concerned to see that a judge sitting alone can try a nonscheduled offence in certain circumstances can the minister say how often that happens i accept as he glares at his officials of whom we do not have the benefit that he may not have the information immediately to hand but i should like him to accept the spirit of the amendment and to write to me and members of the committee that is what lies behind the amendments i believe that it is a \u00a0 reasonable question given that we are all striving for normality and i look forward to the minister\u2019s response", " i look forward to receiving the minister\u2019s written response to the specific question he mentioned that the nonscheduled offence might be connected to the security situation i have some difficulty with that explanation which i address on a later amendment if it is not a scheduled offence should it not be tried separately with a jury i think the minister will take my point", " i accept the minister\u2019s serious response but it is important that we explore the issue the bill sets out the minister\u2019s ability to schedule an offence so that it is then tried in a certain way if other offences are to be tried in that way surely that should be stated in the bill so that we know exactly what is going on however the minister\u2019s response has been very reasonable i look forward to receiving a letter from him and we may look at the issue again on report i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment", " i said that we wanted normalisation but the fact that the bill has been introduced suggests that the situation is not normal the minister says that we cannot allow certain dissident groups to get in the way of progress but the introduction of the bill means that regrettably that is what we are doingi know that the minister is not depending simply on the imc report but given the quote i gave which made it clear that intimidation is strong does he think that in the near future we will be able to appoint juries that will not be intimidated that is not the only aspect of part 7 but it is probably the main part of it", " i welcome you to the chair lady winterton it is the first time that i have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship and i very much look forward to itthe opposition are always opposed in principle to programme motions because a bill should have an adequate amount of time devoted to it however in this case there are two overriding factors first the bill is very short and secondly we are in favour of it in principle so we shall not object to the programme motion and look forward to engaging in the debate", " in my opening remarks i said that the bill has the support of the official opposition as was made clear on second reading we also said that we deeply regret the need for it because we had hoped that paramilitary organisations would cease their activities which would make the bill unnecessary regrettably that is not the case and i might go on to detail one or two reasons why in a moment we regret the need for the bill but nevertheless we recognise that that need is therewe desire normality in northern ireland it is one of the many things that people in northern ireland want they want to be treated normally and they want normality in the province that has not been the case to date but it must be the desire of everybody in the committee and throughout the provinceamendment no 4 is slightly different from our proposal it would give the secretary of state the power to continue provisions in the terrorism act 2000 until 2012 we sympathise with that but we propose that the secretary of state has the power to extend the provisions annually to for example 2012 or beyond if deemed necessary they should be extended annually so that every year we have the chance to consider the situation in northern ireland and determine whether it is necessary to extend the period in which the provisions applythere can be no doubt that the provisions of the 2000 act need to be extended the recent independent monitoring commission report says\u201cthe involvement of paramilitaries in organised crime goes deep\u201dthat is a profound statement it goes on to say\u201cwe have concluded that because of this paramilitary involvement organised crime is the biggest long term threat to the rule of law in northern ireland\u201dit follows up that statement by saying\u201cthe criminals are flexible and resilient\u201d\u201clong term\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d demonstrate why we tabled our amendment and i am sure why the hon gentleman tabled his we are not convinced that by 2008 the situation will be normal the government could at that point introduce primary legislation to extend the provisions of the 2000 act but it could be done better if it were based on our proposalwe are concerned about the situation in northern ireland there can be no doubt that in certain ways there has been much improvement we welcome the ira statement and the statement that followed suggesting that all ira arms had been put beyond use we are worried however because we have yet to hear that the proceeds from the northern bank robbery have been put beyond use that money is unaccounted for we do not know where it is and we do not know the purpose of the bank robbery all we know is that the government the irish government and the police service of northern ireland have stated that the ira was responsible for the robbery it did not take place long ago so the proceeds must still exist even if the ira had disposed of all its weaponry the purchase of more is well within its capability while that situation exists we need the provisions before uson the socalled loyalist side\u2014i do not like to refer to them as loyalists but that is the term attached to them\u2014a statutory instrument will tomorrow specify loyalist groups that can hardly be described as normality there have been six murders so far this year and 69 shootings and 70 beatings in the period between 1 march and 31 august and the feud between the ulster volunteer force and loyalist volunteer force continuesi sat in with the police in belfast and watched the video tape of the riots just a few weeks ago i said this on the floor of the house and i repeat it now it was shameful to see people who were wearing orange order sashes take them off and throw missiles at the police and incite others to do similar that is wrong it is an absolute outrage and it cannot be described as normalityon both sides of the divide criminality and violence continue again the imc report notes\u201cunreported acts of intimidation are far more numerous than acts of violence are often traumatic in their impact and are not recorded in statistics\u201das well as recorded violence there is a background of intimidation again that cannot be described as normalityalthough amendment no 6 is similar to the amendment proposed by the hon gentleman ours is slightly more flexible i therefore commend it to the committee",

we do not yet know the details of the proposals as i understand it the government have said that the ideal force size is at least 4000 officers and have asked the chief constables and police authorities up and down the country to come forward with proposals based on that guidelinegloucestershire constabulary has some 1300 officers and will under the governments criteria be a prime contender for merger with two or three other forces\u2014or possibly as we are beginning to hear with a force that covers the whole of the southwest that latter proposal is the nightmare scenario although it would fit neatly into the governments regionalisation policyeven the proposal to merge gloucestershire constabulary with two or three other forces is unacceptable the constabulary may be relatively small but by all measures it performs very well indeed and surely performance rather than dogma is what matters the constabulary has a good track record of dealing with extraordinary incidents the shoe bomber was arrested in gloucester the largest legal aid fraud case was brought to a successful conclusion in the county as was the infamous west case one of the largest murder investigations in the country all those cases were investigated without the benefit of special grant financial resources add to that the special protection that the constabulary has to provide to

good in the closing the gap report the constabulary was awarded an excellent for strategic management and a good for investigating major and level 2 crimes\u2014the areas critical to the concerns raised from a national perspective last month the whole organisation was recommended for an investors in people award and was graded as being good on financial management in a recent assessment by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary that same body acknowledged that the force had successfully met the challenges of serious and organised crime and terrorism that latter point is most important because the government say that one of the main reasons for proposing mergers is to enable forces to tackle the threat of terrorism more effectively and to counter organised and serious crime however hmic says that gloucestershire constabulary already meets those criterialet me be absolutely clear the fight against terrorism should have as high a profile as possible nothing should be spared in our determination to protect our country and citizens from any form of attack that is one of the biggest challenges that we face and nothing should be allowed to detract from that however as well as that\u2014and not instead of it\u2014it is important to recognise that most of my constituents are more concerned about the yobs on the corner of the street every evening who are drunk on drugs kicking in doors pushing down fences throwing stones swearing threatening and being generally abusive my constituents are more concerned about those people than about alqaedaof course there are criticisms such as we never see a policeman around here the police are obsessed with hounding motorists to the exclusion of everything else and they do not turn up when crimes are reported i am well aware of those criticisms but it must be pointed out that they are made about not just the gloucestershire constabulary or the smaller forces but about forces of all sizes the police are too remote for my liking but that is the fault of too many pointless government targets too much paperwork too much political correctness and yes perhaps too heavy an emphasis on traffic crime when that could be tackled differentlythe police are not just another arm of government they are there to serve the public the question is whether they could better serve the old lady whose purse has been snatched or the shopkeeper whose window has been put in if we made control of the police more remote i do not think that they could the chief constable of gloucestershire dr timothy brain has a detailed knowledge of the entire county when i talk to him about villages or even hamlets in my constituency he knows where i mean and what the issues are would that be true of a chief constable who controlled a force covering three or four counties or for goodness sake the whole southwest it just could not be the caseat present the police authority draws its members from the county but it would become remote unaccountable and unresponsive if members were drawn from three or four counties or from the whole region if the authority represented such a large area how would the enlarged force be financed people make strong enough objections now to paying for increases in the police precept those same people would find it highly objectionable to be asked to pay increasing police precepts\u2014on top of the inexorable rise in council tax\u2014when that money would be spent on police work in other areasthe local aspect is important in the runup to the county council elections the conservatives in gloucestershire said that in office it would fund an extra 63 police officers for the constabulary that is a 5   per cent increase in manpower for the force the conservatives took over administration in may and are starting to fulfil that pledge those extra officers could be lost if the mergers go ahead because the county council is pledged to provide them for gloucestershire onlyin a joint statement chief constable dr timothy brain and the chairman of the police authority brigadier michael browne saidit is our overwhelming conclusion that there is a compelling case for continuing to stand alone as an independent force and we shall be advising the home office of thisthe chief constable goes on to saythe merger process is costly and in assessments made the payback period will be at least eight years which is a cost that will have to be borne by the tax payer this is eight years of money that could and should be invested in the county policethere is no equivocation there from the chief constable or the police authority of gloucestershire they believe that they have met the governments requirements have performed well and are still improving and that to merge police forces would be to throw the baby out with the bathwaterthe government say that forces must be large enough to be blind to existing county borders but even a regional police force would have its borders i live in virtually the most northerly house in the county of gloucestershire i am a long way from cornwall in fact i am as near to the scottish border as to lands end however if a crime were committed just a few hundred yards up the road from me who would deal with it\u2014the remote southwest police force or the much nearer west midlands police force the point that i am making is that taking away county boundaries will not help in that respect a further point is that gloucestershire has far more in common with worcestershire and herefordshire than with cornwall and devon yet the force is more likely to be amalgamated with cornwall and devon or at least wiltshire and avon with which it has nothing in common in other words regions do not exist in any meaningful sensethe people of the northeast voted to reject the proposal to create an elected regional assembly in that area of england yet the government are introducing regional government by stealth proposals to merge the ambulance service the fire service and the police are already on the table as is the move towards regional planning and road funding for example the electorate have never voted for such changes the only place where they are desired is in the proeuropean minds of the prime minister and his governmentto summarise the government say that they want forces to be more capable of tackling national international serious and organised crime and terrorism gloucestershire constabulary which has increased its number of detectives and other specialist investigators has already showed itself to be capable of doing so what the government should be doing is concentrating on improving those forces that are not performing in other words take the rifle approach the blunderbuss approach\u2014setting yet another arbitrary and meaningless target such as the requirement on forces to have a strength of 4000 or more officers\u2014will not achieve the governments objectives nor will it satisfy a dissatisfied public who want osama bin laden arrested but also want an end to the antisocial behaviour at the corner of their streets which is blighting their lives there is an old saying that all politics is local it is not true nor is it true that all policing is local however those are commonly held views", "i am grateful to the hon member who is my neighbour in gloucestershire for making that point the three emergency services moved two years ago into a tristar centre as far as i can see\u2014i have visited it\u2014it is a centre of excellence gloucestershire constabulary has a new building coming as its headquarters yet we are talking about moving it and throwing that all away that is absolutely incredible and he makes a good pointto conclude my remarks in reality control of the police should be a mixture of local as well as national input and there should be no place for mergers based on political dogma arbitrary targets or artificially drawn boundaries i ask the government to think again", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what discussions she has had with the national farmers union about the possible impact of avian influenza on the farming

discuss the more normal aspects of life in northern ireland that makes a pleasant change especially after yesterdays very necessary debate in which probably everyone in this chamber took part i intend to speak for just a few minutes to allow the minister time to respond to the important issues raisedplanning has many objectives it must balance the rights of those who live close to potential developments with the rights of developers themselves and the need for development it must ensure sustainability as well as protect the countryside it must achieve a balance between smaller shops and supermarkets between affordable housing and larger housing and between activity and not having too much traffic there is a balance to be struck the hon member for east antrim was absolutely right when he said that two of the big problems are delays and accountability if those delays are too long or if accountability is not there it is very difficult to achieve the balance and the objectives that i mentionedi pay tribute to the hon members for south antrim dr mccrea for lagan valley mr donaldson for    foyle mark durkan and for upper bann david   simpson who raised a number of local and important issues such as inconsistency in decisions and thirdparty appeals interruption excuse me i have come in this morning not feeling in the best of healthhon members also mentioned levels of investment and the regional planning strategy so many important issues need to be addressed however i entirely concur with the hon member for montgomeryshire when he says that even in england the situation is far from perfect the government have introduced pressure to    delegate many planning decisions to officers indeed   there is a financial inducement to do so i do not necessarily think that that is the right way forward i mention that only to demonstrate that even in england there is concern about the time that decisions are taking that is perhaps something that the minister needs to considerby drawing my remarks to a hasty conclusion i mean no disrespect to hon members from northern ireland i am sure that they realise that the hon member for montgomeryshire and i wanted them to speak rather than to take the time ourselves i had a meeting with the planning people in northern ireland last thursday and one of the questions that i asked was whether it was an objective to move the decisionmaking process to local councils i was a little surprised at the answer which was that not all councils want that authority or power the people to whom i spoke said that some do and some do not perhaps that is a further problem and perhaps the minister could address thatthe other problem relayed to me was the shortage of people considering planning applications given that quite a large number of applications are coming forward as i represent an english constituency i do not know the extent to which those two issues are problems but i raise them because they were raised with me it sounds like they are obstacles in the way of making progress towards a better planning system i look forward to the ministers response not only to those two points but to the many real issues raised by hon members representing constituencies in northern ireland", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement on the progress being made in

schemes for farmers", "i agree with my hon friend the member for aylesbury mr   lidington we regret the necessity for the bill but given the continuing situation in northern ireland it   is indeed necessary that was acknowledged by all   who spoke except the hon member for foyle mark   durkan who would have preferred the government to be bolder in moving towards a more normal situation in northern ireland the rest of the house realises that we are not yet in such a situation i am sorry that we must support the bill but we mustthe hon member for glasgow south mr harris made a measured speech i think he reflected the sentiments of the house in expressing the hope that this was the last occasion on which we would have to consider such legislation he acknowledged however that the present circumstances could represent a false dawn and regretted the fact that many debates of this kind took place against a continuing threat of violencei hesitate to try to sum up a speech by the hon member for north antrim rev ian paisley\u2014soon to be the right hon member\u2014in just a few words but i   shall do my best the hon gentleman drew attention to an apparent contradiction in the governments position although we are constantly told that things are much better in northern ireland\u2014that the ira has given up all its weapons and is ceasing all its activities\u2014we still need to introduce the bill indeed a number of members drew attention to that apparent contradiction no doubt the minister will set our minds at rest when he explains the governments positionmy hon friend the member for south staffordshire sir patrick cormack who chairs the select committee made\u2014as usual\u2014a telling and powerful speech he called for sinn fein members to take their seats and more important for the government to be seen to treat them in the same way as everyone else that i think echoes the thoughts of many other members my hon friend the member for southwest norfolk mr fraser stressed the need for patience and condemned loyalist violence the hon member for belfast north mr dodds\u2014who has apologised for not being able to stay for the windingup speeches\u2014urged caution and emphasised the importance of not risking the welfare of people in northern irelandthe hon member for leeds northwest greg   mulholland spoke of his first visit to northern ireland he mentioned the many good things that he saw but also his disappointment at some unfortunate aspects of the province that still remain the hon member for east londonderry mr campbell said in a passionate speech that it mattered what the ira did not just what it said he also ridiculed\u2014i think i am right to use that word\u2014the action of members of sinn fein in claiming allowances for a job that they did not actually do it surprises many people that they are able to do thatin another passionate speech the hon member for south antrim dr mccrea said that we should not   thank the terrorists for ceasing to do things that they should never have been doing in the first place he   rightly said that there could be no justification for   acts of terrorism on either side of the divide in a wideranging speech the hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson said that members of all political parties who seek to take their seats in government should support the police it is nonsensical to think that a constitutional party can exist without supporting the police who are there to enforce the laws that that party will passas i have said it is unfortunate that we need the bill but we do need it people in northern ireland want many things but most of them want to be treated normally when i last visited northern ireland only last week i saw the need to go beyond having meetings with the police and political parties important though that is i took myself to a hospital a school and one or two other places and saw excellent work being carried out the school system which for some reason the government seem intent on dismantling is achieving very good results\u2014the best in the united kingdom i   believe\u2014through grammar schools and northern ireland education in general those facts are lost however when all we and the media talk about is security it is important to look beyond thatthat said we must recognise that the security situation in northern ireland is still very difficult according to recent reports dissident republicans tried to attract disgruntled members of the provisional ira following the ira statement the continuity ira remainsa dangerous organisation which planned to engage in terrorism and other crimes possibly more than in the recent pastthen there is the feud between the loyalist volunteer force and the ulster volunteer force like my hon friend the member for aylesbury i visited the police in belfast recently i watched videos showing people dressed in orange order sashes taking them off and throwing missiles at the police that is unacceptable we condemn that violence indeed we condemn violence on both sides of the divide it cannot continue while it does continue however we need the billaccording to the recent monitoring commission report during a period of six months recently there were 69 shootings more or less evenly balanced between the two sides of the divide there were 70 paramilitary assaults and six murders that too is unacceptable at a time when there is supposed to be peace in northern ireland we must recognise however that we have some way to go before we secure the peace that we all wantwe do not just need statements from the ira or indeed the lvf we need action more than anything else we need a change in hearts and minds we need people on both sides of the divide to be unwilling to engage in violence to further their political ends we have needed that change in hearts and minds for a long time but we will see it only when people in northern ireland feel that both sides are being treated fairly\u2014when they perceive that constitutional politicians who seek to advance their arguments by peaceful means are rewarded and that terrorists are notwe shall examine one or two aspects of the bill in more detail in committee but for now i wish it well although i very much regret the need for it", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural

because we remove tariff barriers or subsidies is fantasy when one walks through streets and sees people huddled together banging pieces of tin with bricks to make something to sell one realises that they have a long way to go before they can compete in the markets that should rightly be open to them i am not saying that we should not remove trade barriers or subsidies because we certainly should but we also need to do much more to help those countries progresson a recent visit to ethiopia i visited a hospital where the surgeon was an 80yearold lady who was doing a fantastic job but in the countryside i saw the true meaning of a hospital queue with people physically sitting outside the hospital we saw that people live in a space no bigger than the table in the chamber and it has to accommodate 10 or 12 people or families and their animals we also saw girls who spend their entire lives walking to collect water that made us realise how much we need to do to enable those countries to compete we must remember that we have to provide development aid in particular to them as well as humanitarian aid which is provided in response to disasters as well as removing trade barriers we need to do our utmost to persuade the supermarkets which have enormous power to buy more goods from the third world and to have them correctly labelled so that consumers can choose to contribute to the development of third world countries in that wayalthough it is important to give money to good governments we have to remember that people who live in countries that are corrupt or at war are probably in greater need than those who live in countries without those problems it is more difficult to deliver aid in those circumstances but it is even more important to do so and to find a way to do so that is best done through nongovernmental organisations i pay tribute to the aid workers on the ground i have seen the jobs that they do they risk their lives are away from their families and live in appalling conditions to save the lives of the people in those countries i want to place on the record my appreciation for their work it is important to recognise the value of their enthusiasmthe hon member for glasgow north ann mckechin spoke earlier about our visit to rwanda where we walked through the bones and skulls of people who had been massacred in the genocide strangely enough what made me feel worse was our visit to the trials where we saw quite ordinarylooking people who had hacked others to death we wondered whether the situation could ever be sorted out or whether we were just wasting our time gradually however we realised that the fact that those ordinarylooking people had done that kind of thing was a reason to help that is also what motivates the people who work on the ground in those countriesi think that i shall be the lone voice speaking in support of ethiopia today we have heard a number of criticisms of the ethiopian government and i share the concerns about the situation that led to 20 people being killed there and about the people who are being held without charge for demonstrating i shall certainly do my little bit to persuade the government there to bring about a speedy conclusion to that situation i must point out however that only about 14 years ago ethiopia was in the grip of a marxist government recent elections there were observed by 300 international observers there has been an economic growth rate of about 5 per cent and more and more children go to school these days the ethiopian government have also initiated a resettlement programme although quite crude it is trying to bring people from the nonfertile areas which are desperately poor into areas in which they might be able to grow and have access to foodthe ethiopian government are doing everything that they can i understand the secretary of states decision to suspend the increase in aid to ethiopia\u2014i have discussed the matter with him\u2014but i would ask him to keep in close touch with the ethiopian prime minister i know from our discussions that he will as i said earlier the poorer a country is the more help it needs we have to accept that this is africa for goodness sake and we cannot judge africa by our own standards we have our own problems with electoral systems in this country and if we are going to say that anyone who does not have a perfect government and a perfect country cannot have aid i suggest that we are missing the pointi know that the secretary of state will keep a close watch on what is happening in ethiopia with a view to continuing to increase the aid i commend the government for having done so in the past and i hope that we shall be able to resume providing ethiopia with the help that it needs it is a desperately poor country and it really needs our help the blind children and the crippled children on the streets are the ones who need help not the ethiopian government i urge the house to have some tolerance for what is going on in ethiopia and to recognise the real progress that it has made", "my hon friend will be aware that 20 years ago when live aid started half the entire eu

has come in the past few years and we ought to encourage that country elections have recently taken place in ethiopia and yes there are complaints but we must recognise that for the first time those

opposition in committee on the previous bill i can perhaps anticipate what he might have said but i promise to read it tomorrowthey say some things never change in my first parliament i was frequently the last conservative speaker\u2014the windup speaker as it were\u2014and in my third parliament nothing has changed however i do not mind this afternoon because i have been inspired to even greater confidence that the conservative party will be returned to government very soon the reason for my newfound confidence is the quality of the speeches that we have heard from our new members\u2014my hon friends the member for tunbridge wells greg clark for basingstoke mrs miller for rochford and southend east james duddridge for southwest hertfordshire mr gauke for hornchurch james brokenshire and although it was not his maiden speech by my hon friend the member for wantage mr vaizey who has spoken for two days running all were extremely impressive they spoke with such passion about their constituencies that i am tempted to talk about tewkesbury but i think that you would rule me out of order madam deputy speakeri hope that my hon friends will forgive me for not going into each and every speech due to the lack of time and the fact that there were so many i would just say that i am proud to call them colleagues and look forward to working with them all i am sure that they will make great contributions not only to the conservative party but more importantly to the work of this house parliament has become weakened in recent years sad to say but i am sure that their contributions will help to restore some sense of proportionall my hon friends mentioned their predecessors and i too pay tribute to them i saw richard page very recently at epsom races on friday which will come as no surprise to my hon friend the member for southwest hertfordshireas i said i served on the committee that considered the bill and spoke on second reading report and third reading the issue is of great interest to me because i had frontbench responsibilities for it before the general election i appreciated the ministers openness and i am glad that he brought the measure back to the commons as quickly as he could although we welcome it he knows that in committee i tabled many amendments none of which were accepted\u2014i wish the team who serve on the committee better luck the minister might just slip next time\u2014i accept that he did not on the previous occasion\u2014because some aspects of the bill could be strengthenedi always remember the words of my grandfather who said when youre in debt youre in danger that is true but it is also true that some borrowing is necessary some businesses have to borrow and some people have to borrow to get through a difficult time in their lives or perhaps to realise an aspiration it is important that the opportunity to borrow exists but as has been said indebtedness and defaults on debts are increasingalthough it is true that much debt is to do with mortgages many mortgages nowadays are remortgages to cover previous debts on credit cards and so on we are now in an era when we may make a deal for a fiveyear mortgage let us imagine that we borrow \u00a3100000 at the end of the five years when we come to renew the mortgage and perhaps look for a better deal it is unusual to take out another \u00a3100000 instead the figure would probably be \u00a3110000 or \u00a3120000 to cover something extra although that is linked to the house the sum does not necessarily cover only the mortgage it often covers other debts i therefore do not believe that we should ignore the high level of debt in this countrythe 1974 act was introduced in a different era\u2014it seems such a long time ago i was 16 in 1974 and i remember someone bringing an electronic calculator to school it seemed like a revolutionary machine much has changed since then i therefore welcome the governments attempts to deal with the new status of consumer credit our objective must be to strike a      balance between protecting people and not overburdening what are by and large good businesses that provide a good service we should have available credit but try to ensure that people are not ripped off or end up with more debt than they can manage that is easy to domy hon friend the member for wealden charles hendry described how he was persuaded to take out a credit card with a \u00a33500 limit he has far more resources than me yet i ended up against my better judgment when i was not paying attention at\u2014i will name the company\u2014marks and spencer with a credit card with a limit of \u00a37500 i did not ask for that credit card i thought that i would get a card that simply gained points so that the next time i went to the store i would get 10 per cent off it was not sold to me especially accurately and it was only when i showed it to my secretary that i realised what it was the ease with which i got that card struck me as possibly dangerous it is easy to get into debt and borrow money it is much easier to borrow than to earn money we must remember thatwe have heard a little about the lack of education about debt we rightly warn people of the dangers of alcohol cigarettes\u2014perhaps i should not mention that campaign\u2014drugs and other things however we rarely if ever educate people about the dangers of debt many years ago perhaps it could be said that i had more debts than was good for me it is depressing to go out to work and find that most of ones income goes on paying past bills and debts it is perhaps even worse when someone in employment takes out a loan then things go wrong or they find themselves unemployed and they simply do not have the money to pay off their debts we really must consider the importance of educating people about debtwe also need a very good regulatory regime and i know that that is what the government are trying to achieve i am not quite sure that we shall get there as a result of this bill although i broadly support it as i did last time in committee however certain aspects of it need improvement the main difference in this bill is the change from a test for extortion to a test for unfairness which i welcome however it is extraordinary that the 1974 act included a definition of extortion yet this bill contains no definition of unfairness we have moved from defining what is illegal to not doing so which strikes me as odd there are many drawbacks involved in that move lenders will not know what is illegal but more importantly neither will borrowers how is a vulnerable borrower to decide whether to go to court to get an agreement struck out when he and more importantly his lawyers do not know what is legal and what is not it has been pointed out that until a number of court cases have established case law on this matter there can be no certainty i do not therefore believe that these measures move us forward quickly enough in the right directionwe have also been told that the office of fair trading will issue guidelines well we heard that in january at that time i asked in committee when that would take place it is now june and we still do not have the guidelines even more worrying is the increased power that the bill will give to the oft i have come across a similar problem before and the minister knows the example that i am going to cite i have an interest in horse racing i represent the cheltenham racecourse\u2014the greatest racecourse in the world\u2014which is in the tewkesbury constituency the oft carried out an investigation into the running of the horse racing industry that was potentially destructive because it simply did not understand the industryhowever the most depressing aspect of the matter for me as a constituency member of parliament was that i had no way of affecting the ofts decision i had no access to its representatives i could not go to see them i could write to them and i got some bland replies but i could not bring the case to the house and ask the appropriate minister to intervene actually the minister did his best\u2014in fact i think that there were a couple of ministers involved as the matter spanned two departments\u2014but the issue had already been referred to another body that had the potential to destroy a very important industry in the light of that experience i am very concerned about giving the oft the powers contained in the billregarding the lack of a definition of unfairness it is even worse that the bill will apply retrospectively it is not even as though lenders will be able to say well from now on we are going to be very careful they can say that of course but in the case of agreements that have already been drawn up it will be too late retrospective legislation should not be encouraged i know that there will sometimes be grey areas in which it might have to be considered but i do not think that this is one of them i also expressed my concern about this in committeei am also worried about companies that make small loans\u2014companies that collect \u00a35 a week from their customers who by and large seem very happy with the arrangement this legislation could be a bit heavy handed for those lenders by and large they seem to do a fairly good job and they are quite popular with their customers and i hope that the new provisions do not cause problems for them those small loans can be very helpful to peoplei am also concerned about the problem\u2014i am not sure whether the bill addresses it at all\u2014of people who get into trouble by borrowing not necessarily from one source at a high interest rate but from a number of sources someone who applies for a mortgage is assessed in terms of their income and so on and they either get the mortgage or not the same care is not taken however when someone applies for a credit card it is therefore very easy to borrow \u00a32000 on one credit card \u00a32000 on another and \u00a32000 on another which ends up as an awful lot of money when we considered the bill we heard the sad case of the gentleman who committed suicide because of his spiralling debts from 22 credit cards the fact that he had so many cards is exactly why he got into that situationi discussed the ease with which cards are issued with the industry and received the rather bland response well okay that is the risk we take if there are enough people with credit cards it can afford one or two dropping out\u2014i am paraphrasing what it said\u2014so it does not take as much care on loans of \u00a32000 as it might otherwise do that is okay if someone has only one loan of say \u00a32000 but when they have 10 loans which they have been able to get because of the lack of data sharing the situation ends up being very serious i want the government to examine that", "i entirely agree with the hon gentleman and i think that most would do so as with most legislation we are addressing the small percentage of cases in which that does not happen most borrowers would probably take an interest in what they were borrowing examine the interest rate and assess whether they could afford it but some do not and that is the group whom we are trying to help that is a difficult balance and legislation needs to be shaped to take those different circumstances into accountwith regard to the proposal for an interest rate ceiling i agreed with the government in committee and opposed that not only because it is my natural tendency to want to see the free market work but because practical problems can also arise the interest rate charged is not the only difficulty\u2014other charges can be levied such as a charge made when a loan is taken out a charge made for running an agreement a charge made for defaulting and a charge made for sending letters to borrowers who have missed payments i remember one example of a loan that i had many years ago the lender claimed that i had missed the end payments i said that i had not and i had to take a solicitors advice i won the case\u2014 i did not owe the lender the money that it was suggesting the lender however wrote to me and tried to charge me \u00a320 per letter i wrote back to it saying that is fine i charge \u00a330 a letter most people would not have my nerve or confidence and would end up with a lot of debt because of that my point therefore is that the interest rate is not the only factor about which we need to be concernedas i said earlier i would have preferred a guideline\u2014i tried to introduce such an amendment in committee\u2014under the unfairness test in the bill perhaps considering prevailing interest rates at the time and the relative strength of the parties including such guidelines would not mean that other things could not be taken into account by the courts\u2014the ministers argument was that the courts hands would be tied if the bill were too prescriptive i do not think that that would be the case however the court could consider other factors if the wording of the bill were rightmaximum interest rates could have the effect of dragging up the average of the interest rates charged and as the minister said earlier could exclude those who need to borrow at the lower end of the market and who take out shortterm loans i know that those tend to be the people whom we are trying to protect but again it is a question of striking the right balance and i do not think an interest rate ceiling is the answer i do not think a minister\u2014not this minister in particular for i trust him entirely but ministers in general\u2014should have the authority to introduce such a draconian measurea suggestion that i made in committee does not seem to have been adopted in the new bill under the half rule someone can take out a fouryear loan to buy say a car with the option of returning the car after four years and ending the loan altogether i have spoken to representatives of both sides of the argument consumers and motor manufacturers and i am convinced that that degree of uncertainty helps no one i think that when people can get out of an agreement in that way interest rates may become somewhat higher than they would be otherwise the caveat emptor rule should apply and those who take out a loan for four years should have to pay it off we must have balance and fairness i know that the government consulted widely at the time and i should like to know whether they have made any progressby and large i welcome the bill and recognise the need to update the 1974 act i hope that the minister will be a little friendlier to the new committee than he was when i was trying to get certain amendments past him because i think the bill could be improved it needs a few more teeth in some respects and needs to be less burdensome in others it does not quite strike the right balance nevertheless it represents a good step forward and i wish it and the committee well", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for giving way and apologise to the minister for missing his speech although i served in committee on the previous bill so i have probably heard most of his argumentsi do not usually try to help liberal democrat spokesmen but i will do so on this occasion because we should not go down the road of capping interest rates the bill does not state what constitutes unfairness in section 1382a of the 1974 act one of the things that constituted extortionate was a comparison of interest rates prevailing at the time that an agreement is made we are withdrawing the specification and qualification of what extortionate means and are leaping towards unfairness which is probably a better test but the fact that we are not defining unfairness is the

"i too congratulate the hon member for wansbeck mr   murphy on securing this debate as the hon member for hazel grove mr stunell said it is a timely one because we stand at a crossroads in terms of energy suppliesfrom the research i have had done the world will according to the international energy agency need almost 60 per cent more energy in 2030 than it does now the hon member for wansbeck and indeed other right hon and hon members have explained why that is the case china and india which i think contain about a third of the worlds population are expanding at a rapid rate of knots and will create an energy need much as i would like to think it were the case it is rather ambitious to expect that energy saving will counter the growing demand the world will require far more energy that is the case at a time when our coal industry is under environmental pressures they largely result from directives from the european union but they also come partly from kyoto and from the fact that we take a very responsible attitude to climate changethe coal industry is under environmental pressure and our nuclear industry is in question because although it currently provides about 22 per cent of our electricity that will be reduced to 2 per cent in only 20   years time given the nature of the nuclear industry if we do not start planning now for life extensions or for new build it will die there is no question about that we are in danger of losing scientists to companies abroad because a number of new nuclear reactors are being built worldwide\u2014or there are plans to build them i think that 23 countries are planning to expand their civil nuclear capabilities we are in danger of losing scientists to the rest of the world on 6 may the next government regardless of which party wins the election will have to look carefully at the future of the   nuclear industryour countrys gas supplies are starting to decline i do not want to be alarmist but we will probably become net importers of gas next year or maybe the year after that we last discussed energy in this chamber on 19   january that debate focused on the future of gas and the minister was extremely candid for which i pay tribute to him he said that if there is high demand for gas in the coming winter or the winter after that our gas supplies could be rather tight i do not particularly blame the minister but that that is the case is a disgrace in a country with an economy as large as ours because we do not need to be in that situation we must give a lot of thought to our energy policyi entirely agree with the comments of a number of   members including the right hon member for cunninghame north mr wilson about the need for   a balanced energy supply in future i say with some trepidation that one reason is that we have in the past been overreliant on a single primary source of energy the coal industry had too much control over our energy supplies i say that as someone whose father was a miner and i am unreservedly sorry that things have worked out as they have for the coal industry but it is important that we learn lessons from the past and i do not want our country to be overreliant again on any one source of energy the way things are going with environmental challenges to our coal industry our countrys dwindling gas supplies and the possible withering of our nuclear industry we could find ourselves in the situation described by the right hon gentleman with gas supplying 70 per cent or more of our electricity production and a large proportion of it being importedas the hon member for hazel grove said there is nothing wrong with importing gas from norway and the negotiations for securing its gas supplies are at an advanced stage but norway will supply only a small part of our future gas import needs gas will have to come from further afield it is possible that the gas supply that we get from russia or qatar or one or two other places such as algeria might not be interrupted because of political instability in those countries or terrorist activity and i sincerely hope that that is the case however if i were energy minister and we were overdependent on gas supplies from certain areas of the   world i would not be too confident that i could guarantee to the people of this country that the lights would not go out such supplies might never be interrupted but the government have to be realistic we must provide greater assurances we should not depend too much on any single source of energy when it comes from such countries and from far awayif our country and the world in general were to become too dependent on gas there would also be an economic danger we could well see the development of a gas equivalent of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries and i would not want to speculate about what effect that might have on the price of gas we must bear that in mindthat brings us back to the question of what our countrys policies should be there must be a debate on the future of the nuclear industry i pay tribute to those labour members who are being open and honest about their views on that it was a tragedy in the past that the conservative party was seen as anticoal and the labour party as procoal and that the labour party was seen as antinuclear and the conservative party as pronuclear i hope that we can consign such divisions to history as they are not helpful the provision of energy supplies should not be a party political issue and i pay tribute to those members of all parties who say that we need a clear policy on new build and on the life extension of existing nuclear plantswhat about the rest of our policy there are opportunities at least to preserve what is left of our coal industry when we talk about that industry we should divide it into two sections the mining industry and the generation of electricity from coal because they are slightly different things as the hon member for hazel grove said we import more than 50 per cent of the coal that we burn there are good reasons for that it is low in sulphur content which helps us meet our environmental requirements however we must look to the future and   explore possibilities for providing clean coal technology i hope that we can achieve that although it is not entirely clear how we can do so without writing cheques for massive sums and i am not going to say that the government should write cheques for sums that are too large for any section of the industrythe creation of a free market in energy has led to a fall in energy prices paradoxically that has created a problem in attracting investment which we must address i hope that we can move towards clean coal technology at least as quickly as the government have tried to move towards wind power that industry has been given \u00a3117 million to develop offshore wind farms the supply of energy from which will be intermittent and unreliablethe great thing about coal is that it has been a very good backstop\u2014i do not want that to sound derogatory the nuclear industry is a base load supplier of electricity but coal is far more flexible and it has provided a very cheap source of electricity if i were to look ahead and see the continuing decline of the coal industry i would be sad i accept that we have to address our environmental challenges but i would be unhappy if the coal industry were to decline in the way that it has done members have quoted figures on that and i will not repeat them but it was only 1990 when coal provided about 66 per cent of our electricity generation and the figure has fallen to below 30 per cent i think that it has fallen recently for the reasons that we have given but the minister will correct my figures if they are wrong it is obvious that the trend is downward regardless of whether the correct current figure is 28 per cent or 32 per cent we must question whether we want to allow that trend to continuei again

if i am in order in doing so on the closing remarks of the hon member for rhondda chris bryant for the courts to consider whether something is unfair it will largely be up to the debtor to take the issue to court i think that i am right in saying that how many debtors will have the confidence to take a matter to court when it is not even established what will constitute an unfair relationship or

1974 act being retrospective when the details of what was required were on the face of the bill and the present bill being retrospective when the details are not on the face of the bill is it not wrong to pass retrospective legislation when the details of its application are to be left to the courts to establish in a piecemeal manner", "i am grateful to the minister but i do not entirely accept that putting something on the face of the bill means that something is left out i suppose that by definition it is but it is possible to put on the face of the bill some examples of what the courts might want to give credence to that does not mean that the courts cannot look at other things as well many acts of parliament contain clauses that end by saying and the secretary of state shall do whatever else he thinks fit\u2014i paraphrase but i think we all recognise that such a provision appears in very many acts of parliament i think it is called a henry viii clause or something like that so i do not accept that stating some examples of what the court should take into account means that it cannot take into account other thingsto summarise i stress that we welcome the change from extortionate to unfair we accept that some retrospection is necessary\u2014perhaps even desirable\u2014in this type of legislation but we do regret the lack of detail as regards what constitutes an unfair agreement we also regret the fact that retrospective legislation is effectively being introduced by the courts and possibly the oft and ministers but not parliament that is the point it is as i said in committee a double whammy it is retrospective legislation introduced other than by parliament that cannot be the right way of carrying out what is generally appropriate legislation and therefore i would ask the minister to reconsider his approach in this respect", "i want to deal mainly with amendment no 22 which relates to retrospection but i also want to add a few thoughts about our debate on amendment no 21 which was ably moved by the hon member for gordon malcolm bruce he touched on many important issues and i agree that it is far too easy for people to take out credit these daysthe hon member for gordon rightly drew attention to the fact that when a \u00a3150000 mortgage is applied for every nook and cranny will quite rightly be examined it is a major commitment on behalf of the lender as well as the borrower which is why such an application is so seriously looked into unfortunately that does not happen when someone wants to borrow just \u00a33000 i know from private conversations that lenders do not really look into the proposal too seriously if they lost one or two lots of \u00a33000 here and there they would still be making enough out of the interest on the many other lots of \u00a33000 for it not to matter that much they tend not to bother too much about applications for relatively small amounts the problem is of course that people can borrow \u00a33000 from this company another \u00a33000 from that company and so forth one lot of \u00a33000 is not very much but when they are all added together it could represent a significant debt for an individuali well understand how easy it is for people to get into great difficulty while we were debating the bill in committee i recall hearing a report on the today programme\u2014a very sad report that featured a widow whose husband had committed suicide because he had got into terrible debt as a result of having 22 credit cards that really set the tone of debate in committee tragic though it was the radio programme did a useful service for our considerations but we all wished that the tragedy had not happened in the first placei was concerned about the issue and tabled an amendment on data sharing unfortunately it was not selected but it would have required many changes to the data protection act 1998 which we are not considering we are amending the consumer credit act 1974 in it i sought to make it easier for lenders to share information on potential debtors the credit reference agency carries many details on people who have defaulted or been late with payments or who have county court judgments that is fine but often they do not share information on how many credit cards people have or what their level of income is that is where the problem begins because it is so easy to take out many credit cardsi do not wish to add to the anecdotes but over christmas i had such an experience i bought several items from marks and spencer i was not paying much attention to what i was doing it was hot in the store and i just wanted to get out and get home i ended up signing up to what i thought was just a points card but turned out to be a mastercard with which i could instantly spend up to \u00a37500 anywhere in the country i did not ask for that or want it that is how easy it is to take out a credit card the minimum number of checks was done presumably a credit check was carried out but the store had no idea whether i had other credit cards and no proof of my income i am probably reasonably safe with that credit card but many people are not in my amendment i wanted to enable lenders to have access to information in that situation", "the minister is as helpful as ever we have made enough points on that amendment and i agree with him in principleamendment no 22 relates to retrospection with particular respect to the unfair test which replaces the extortionate test in the 1974 act we approve of the change of test of an agreements legality from extortionate to fair it fits with the reasonable requirement and test of english law\u2014reasonable being the most important word in english law given the nature of this business it is possible that some retrospection is necessary for example is it not the case that a respectable company would only ever enter into what could be considered a fair agreement with an individual if an unfair agreement continues to run is it not right that the courts should be allowed to look at it and bring to an end the suffering of the weaker party i accept that there are some reasons for retrospectionseveral problems result however philosophically legislation is not normally retrospective indeed it is a principle of legislation that it should not be retrospective because it is unfair in itself for someone to be fined or punished or have their business disbanded because some years previously they behaved in a manner that complied with the law then but the law has subsequently changed as the finance and leasing association has said applying laws retrospectively is equivalent to recording a motorist driving 40 miles an hour on a 40 limit road in 1995 but fining that motorist in 2005 because the speed limit has subsequently been reduced to 30 that sums it up as all students of history will agree figures of the past should be judged by the standards of the times in which they lived not by the standards that exist nowretrospective legislation is bad enough but not having the requirements of the legislation in the bill is worse because lenders will not know what they are supposed to be doing retrospectively the bill does not state what will constitute an unfair agreement and that is the crux of the matter we will never be completely certain of what constitutes an unfair agreement because the courts will have to decide in each case and one case will not set a precedent for subsequent cases unless they are identicalthe government and the office of fair trading may issue guidance but if it is considered to be a remedial order it might contravene schedule 2 to the human rights act 1998 unless it is laid before parliament there is no suggestion in the bill that that is the intentionthe unfairness test is retrospective and i understand that it will apply to agreements reached before enactment of the bill certainly in some respects if not all there will be a transitional period which the secretary of state can extend but existing agreements will be affecteda further point which is slightly complicated is that if the industry complies with the original guidance and it later changes will we be creating further retrospection because of the fluid nature of the business and the change to the guidelines leaving those details out of the bill is a backward step because section 138 of the consumer credit act 1974 defines the meaning of extortionate by listing the evidence that should be taken into account\u2014for example prevailing interest rates the age experience business capacity and state of health of the debtor the degree to which he was under financial pressure at the time the degree of risk accepted by him his relationship to the lender and whether a cash price was quoted for any goods or services included in the credit bargain the bill repeals that section leaving lenders totally in the dark about what constitutes an unfair agreement i tabled amendments in committee which would have gone some way towards addressing the problem but sadly the government did not accept themthat vagueness has led to a great deal of unrest and concern in the industry i have received representations from among others the british bankers association the council of mortgage lenders the consumer credit association the finance and leasing association the association for payment clearing services cattles royal bank of scotland barclays the zacchaeus trust and mbna europe bank ltd all are concerned about the lack of guidance on the unfairness test and that concern is increased by the retrospection in the billas i said there is a transitional period for the industry to clean up its act and to clean up the agreements that it feels it should clean up but how can it do so if it does not know what the criteria are for determining what represents an unfair agreement", "the minister mentions\u2014as did i\u2014competitiveness and the free market in a competitive world the free market will put a downward pressure on interest rates because companies obviously want to sell their products is there any way\u2014i cannot think of one\u2014in which we can examine the effect on the vulnerable who are more likely to be paying higher interest rates this is a difficult problem but i ask the government to give serious thought when they issue their guidelines to how such people might be protected i do not agree with imposing a ceiling on interest rates but i do accept that such people have a problem", "this has been an interesting debate and it reflects well on the house that we can have such a well informed debate even when we hold different opinionsit is important that we discuss the issue because even if we do not agree with what is proposed the debate sends a message to the industry that it needs to deal with people fairly and compassionately we all know that those who can least afford the higher interest rates are those most likely to have to pay them which is a good reason to discuss the issueanother good reason is that personal debt in increasing only this morning in the times business section there was a report on hbos which has announced that the value of its unsecured loans where borrowers are three months or more in arrears last year rose by more than 20 per cent from \u00a314 billion to \u00a317 billion that is a tremendous amount of money hbos figures also referred to borrowers with secured loans totalling \u00a3952 million being three months or more in arrears which was an increase of 100 per cent in the past year so debt and arrears are increasing the reason for that is not necessarily the rate of interest that those people pay but the point is relevant to this debatealthough the bill is well intentioned and contains much that is good there is a feeling that it lacks the teeth to address the issues that concern us although we accept that as i am sure the minister will say such matters are covered by the unfairness test which we support we are concerned that we do not yet know what unfair means in that context however i shall return to that issue on a later amendment there is a need for clarity on how we will address the problem of indebtedness particularly among those who can least afford itthere are nevertheless a number of reasons some of which have already been raised why i cannot agree that having the minister set the maximum level of interest rates is the way forward one of the most important points which has been mentioned is that the rate of interest is not the only thing that matters there are of course difficulties with agreeing on what that maximum rate should be indeed as the hon member for rhondda chris bryant said if a maximum rate were set lenders might be inclined to increase their standard rates to nearer the maximum than otherwisethe point however is that the interest rate is not the only thing that matters the charges that often go with loans are what count the ability legal or not of lenders to write letters when people have missed payments and charge them \u00a325 \u00a340 or whatever for the privilege of doing so is unfair that adds to the cost of the loan the interest rate is only one part although it is of course an important partwe must also take into account companies that collect money on the doorstep\u2014the hon member for gordon malcolm bruce referred to that rather than companies that lend on the doorstep\u2014which can often provide a more flexible approach although the interest rates of those companies might be higher than what is found through the ordinary way of borrowing money they may offer a more flexible service they know their customers and can sometimes tell them that if they cannot pay one week they can pay twice the next week i accept that that can lead to problems but the difficulty is not crucial when we are talking about amounts of only \u00a35 a week for example to take away the flexibility to benefit customers simply because the interest rate charged is higher than normal would be to miss the real problemmy main reason for opposing setting maximum rates of interest is that i do not consider that to be the governments job we must strike a balance between protecting consumers and making it impossible for people to get a loan or credit even if they have to pay a bit more money i believe in the free market i accept that we have to regulate sometimes but we must not overregulate and allow the government to interfere in every aspect of peoples lives the british people have a good deal of common sense and we must allow them to borrow money at the rates that they deem acceptablequestions have been raised about the transparency of interest rates and to some extent that problem has been addressed by a statutory instrument much remains to be done in that regard however and i accept that we must protect vulnerable people as lack of choice means that they are more likely to borrow at higher rates of interest than the rest of usthat said we must leave the determination of interest rates charged on credit transactions to those who want to borrow and those who want to lend i recognise that this matter needed to be debated and those who tabled the new clauses have done so very competently however for the reasons that i have given i cannot recommend to conservative members that they should support the new clause", "i want to deal with the new clause only briefly and in general terms we made the point on second reading and indeed i made it at considerable length in committee\u2014i think that the minister anticipates what i shall say\u2014that we are really concerned about increasing the power of the oft i should be ruled out of order if i repeated the arguments that i put forward on second reading and particularly those that i gave in committee but the extra powers that the oft will get from the bill are a matter of concern to a great many people\u2014in the industry and generally\u2014and to hon members", "i see my hon friends queuing up i shall give way to my hon friend the member for surrey heath mr hawkins", "my hon friend is right we have a very flexible and successful industry i was going to say that we support the principles of the bill but that we are concerned about aspects of it\u2014which we explored in committee and can explore this afternoon my hon friend has put his finger on one of thosethe oft is already a powerful organisation it was not created by the consumer credit act 1974 but it has been given an awful lot of powers i bored hon members at length in committee and on second reading\u2014", "the minister says that i did noti discussed at great length in committee my problems with another matter in which i have a constituency interest\u2014the horse racing industry as we approach the great week at cheltenham it is probably appropriate to remind the house that the way in which the oft was looking at the horse racing industry was very clumsy", "i apologise madam deputy speakeri was going to say that the oft threatened to wreck the industry with a heavyhanded approach and to make the point that there was little that the house could do about it i am therefore concerned about giving the oft more powers when we cannot affect its decisions i shall attempt to explore that issue a little more deeply on a later amendment however although i shall certainly not recommend to my hon friends that we oppose the new clause i want to put it on the record that we recognise the fears expressed by industry representatives that the oft is becoming far too powerful i regret that", "my hon friend is right and the objective of legislation of this kind is balance that involves being fair to consumers\u2014consumer protection is of paramount importance\u2014but not throwing the baby out with the bath water by being too prescriptive we shall come to that issue in a few minutes i suspect on other amendments i am concerned about the extra powers being given to the oft especially when the house cannot affect what it does when constituents complain to us about matters that we cannot raise with the people who make the decisions that is regrettable", "given that in a debate in westminster hall on 19 january the minister saidgas supplies might be tight if demand rises to high levels in

increase investor confidence and that talk of a windfall tax\u2014or worse its imposition\u2014would destroy confidence at the very time that we need it", "to ask the secretary of statefor health what a instructions and b policy guidelines on proposed mergers of ambulance services have been given by his department to health authorities", "to ask the secretary of state for health if he will make a statement on the merging of ambulance services", "i am grateful to the minister for explaining the issues very clearly i accept what she says but does she not agree that the document is very complex and that it will not be easy for anybody\u2014even people involved in the process\u2014to understand it fully and comment on it especially given the very short time scale", "i accept that there are different stages to the process but i would suggest it is off to a bad start in this particular case the minister says there will be further consultation in 2006 without wishing to be pedantic i have to say that that really proves the point i was trying to make about the document it says if necessary there will be further consultation which seems slightly different from what the minister is saying so will there be more consultation or not is it intended that there will be rather than that it will occur if necessary", "i was referring to the document on housing in cheltenham and gloucester as being very confusing and i went through some of the detailed reasons for that i also mentioned the misleading quote in the document and was about to say that the highlighted bit on page 5 is probably the most important part but is based on a completely false premise falsely represented assumptions arbitrary figures approximations guesswork and a very misleading quote all appear in a very small part of the documentmy next concern is that the regional assembly and the other people who worked on the document are taking the wrong tack on housing altogether i do not intend to be party political but in opposition the labour party said that it would end the predictandprovide approach to planning i welcomed that but in the document we have proposals being made on the basis of birth and death rates migration household size divorce rates and economic trends page 13 statesif this continues the population of gloucestershire in 2026 is likely to be in the order of 668000if that is not a prediction i do not know what is and if this document is not about providing in order to satisfy that prediction i do not know what is unfortunately the principle of predict and provide is still going strong when will the government fulfil their 1997 commitment to end that approach to housingi turn to the green belt in question time on 19 january in answer to a question from my hon friend the member for daventry mr boswell the prime minister saidfor those families who are struggling to get on the housing ladder it is important that we increase the supply of housing in a planned and orderly way that does not affect the green belt\u2014official report 19 january 2005 vol 429 c 810in this document four options for that increased housing are put forward option 1 would be in a green belt greenfield area option 2 would also be in a green belt greenfield area option 3 says that it will have amajor impact on critical area of green belt this development would encroach on the area that is most important for maintaining the separation of cheltenham and gloucesteroption 4 also says that it would include the green belt therefore all four options include major building\u2014if not the entirety of the building\u2014on the green belt how does the prime minister square his words in the chamber less than two weeks ago about protecting the green belt with the document that the deputy prime minister will consider that proposes major incursions into the green belti turn now to the flood plain two rivers the severn and the avon converge at tewkesbury and continue down the severn vale as the river severn causing flooding all the way down at certain times of the year it will make matters considerably worse to build on or near the flood plain last year the governments inspector mary travers suggested building 580 houses both on and near the flood plain between longford and innsworth that was bad enough but this document goes much further its proposals would involve a massive building programme either on or very near the flood plain that could have serious implications and it is wrongthis is a poor document it is badly written its assumptions are general and arbitrary and it proposes a development the size of gloucester\u2014which is a considerable size\u2014to be built largely if not entirely in my constituency on the green belt and close to if not on the flood plain", "the hon gentleman is right i do not want to name areas but there are places where villages are dying they could do with a little extra building and a little extra infrastructure too the hon gentleman is right to say that that need is not mentioned in this document people trot out the mantra the houses have to go somewhere but certain areas of the southwest are not developed properly for example cornwall and devon are not economically developed all we will end up with is a selffulfilling prophecy if we build more and more houses in my constituency the prices will fall and people will fill up the houses and then turn around and say well there we are we needed the housesi am digressing slightly but i am concerned about this document the consultation period ends on 18 february that is bad enough but i defy most people to understand what it is going on about the figures that are being bandied about where they have come from what this means what period of time we are talking about and what is the total number of houses we are talking about it is incomprehensible asking people to respond in such a short time and asking them to understand this nonsense of a document is asking far too much we are talking about a serious matter which given all the problems that go with building houses could completely change not only my constituency but the surrounding areasi would be grateful if the minister could address the points that i have raised about the document and let me know whether there is anything that she can do not to wreck the whole process\u2014i accept that there has to be a process\u2014but to ensure that it is carried out fairly professionally and competently because at the moment that is not being done", "i think that we are about to be interrupted by another vote but i shall see what progress i can make i am grateful to the minister for turning up to hear what i have to say and i look forward to hearing her responsei intend to discuss the south west regional assemblys proposals for housing in gloucestershire and in particular the consultation document that it has issued which is entitled shaping the future of cheltenham and gloucester to 2026 the proposals are part of the spatial strategy required by the planning and compulsory purchase act 2004 the title page of the document also includes the wordswork undertaken on behalf of the south west regional assemblyi understand that some of that work was done by gloucestershire county councili have a number of problems with the document and i will list five of them first the consultation period on the document is very short secondly the document is very confusing and in some areas incomprehensible thirdly it has taken the wrong tack on housing fourthly its proposals seriously compromise the position of the green belt and fifthly they certainly endanger the flood plainpowers given to the south west regional assembly and to the deputy prime minister are quite strong some might even call them excessive in terms of house building in my view it should be left to local bodies to decide the basis on which houses are built in their arearegional government was rejected by the people of the northeast yet the government seem to be introducing it by stealth by giving increasing power to unelected quangos the regionalisation of england is consistent with the breaking down of the united kingdom through devolution which is convenient if we are to move towards a federal europe of regions in which countries do not exist perhaps i digress too much but that is an important argument against regionalisation the quality or lack thereof of the document is also important it demonstrates the folly of having too many layers of bureaucracythe spatial strategies will supersede the local plans and the county structure plan already tewkesbury borough councils plan has cost \u00a3300000 largely because of costs associated with a government inspection of the local plan inquiry there are five other districts in gloucestershire i think that i am right in saying that gloucester itself has not prepared a local plan the hon member for gloucester mr dhanda will correct me if i am wrong a lot of money has been spent on preparing those local plans and the structure plan all of which will be swept aside by the spatial strategyi shall discuss each of the points that i mentioned printed along the bottom of the document in capital letters are the words have your say yet the consultation period is just four and a half weeks it closes on friday 18 february it is already 1 february and this debate has been held as soon as it could be the government guidelines for the consultation period on this type of document suggest 12 weeks why therefore is this consultation period not 12 weeks was the publication of the document delayed has that truncated the consultation period and if so why was that allowed to happeni described the document as confusing the proposals and the analysis are in parts incomprehensible", "the hon gentleman is right the confusion is not helpful and now we get another confusing aspect to the matter with the publication of this documentregional planning guidance note 10 suggests that 2400 houses per annum are required between 2005 and 2016 the document that we are discussing tests other proposals including rpg10 plus 25 per cent and rpg10 plus 50 per cent it saysthe steering groups studies have led to the rpg10 levels of growth  50 being discounted as a viable option due to transport constraints and the inability of the local economy to sustain this level of growthbut it is not being discounted the south west regional assembly and the government could go for that option the wording is not only misleading but downright wrong how can this be a serious consultation document if it says that one option has been discounted when it has not where have the plus 25 per cent and plus 50 per cent figures come from were they just plucked out of the air or are they based on past trends and therefore a reliable extrapolationfurthermore the document says that 60 per cent of the houses should be in the principal urban area that is also not true that is not the proposal the 60 per cent figure is what the county structure plan third alteration panel report 2004 recommended but that has not been accepted by the south west regional assembly it has not been decided that 60 per cent of the houses should be in the principal urban area page 5 of the document headedhow much development are we talking aboutis based on false premises the highlighted

retaining consumer protection which i do not wish to undermine however perhaps consumers are paying more for credit than they should be because of it it is a matter of weighing up and interpreting the evidence and of striking the right balance the department has already looked at section 100 but it may need to reanalyse the situation as it could become a problem because more and more cars are being sold\u2014although the section \u00a0 does not apply only to cars this rather strange area of law should be examined the market was very different when the 1974 act was introduced and because of that\u2014if for no other reason\u2014section 100 should be looked at again in more detail however i beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion motion and clause by leave withdrawn ", " i too thank mr benton and sir john butterfill who chaired the deliberations on tuesday i also thank my colleagues and all hon members who have contributed to the spirit and detail of the discussion of the bill i

left unresolved it is unfortunate that we did not manage to get a goal past himi am reminded of an interview that enoch powell once did on europe the interviewer asked him mr powell havent you failed he replied maybe failed but i wasnt wrong ", " there is not going to be a vote then", " my problem is that when we looked into the situation involving the school and the photocopier we seemed to be unable to move the case forward at all that was despite taking legal advice and indeed because a school was involved the legal department thoroughly examined the case i will look at the case again and see whether the legal bods missed something as i have often said i am not a lawyer and cannot be expected to advise on the law however i want to reexamine the case and perhaps we could return to it on report or consider it in another committee", " i am extremely grateful to the minister for his helpful response i do not want to make this matter purely about me and my constituency many schools in gloucestershire fell foul of that company in that particular situation any clarification will help at a national level but it will also help those schools the matter is not too small to be important so i am grateful to the minister for his sympathetic response with that in mind i beg to ask leave to withdraw the motionmotion and clause by leave withdrawn ", " i beg to move that the clause be read a second timethis is our last throw in committee so i shall try to make it a good one this new clause refers to what is often termed the half rule the voluntary termination of a contract to continue the car analogy if someone enters into a hire purchase agreement to buy a car\u2014having had such an agreement i declare an interest\u2014the law states that they may hand the car back at any time and be liable for only half of the due payments that applies to the capital and the interest i think that i have correctly understood the law on the face of it that is beneficial to consumers who have a car and can hand it back as long as it is in a reasonable condition the definition of reasonable condition can be problematic but that is not the point i am making the finance and leasing association and other groups such as motor manufacturers financiers and rental companies support my amendment it may appear that handing the car back after three months six months or halfway through the term benefits the consumer but there is a problem if that is costing the hire purchase companies a lot of money\u2014i am advised that it is\u2014somebody somewhere is paying for that the hire purchase companies\u2014i mean no disrespect to them\u2014will not foot the bill themselves if i hand a car back somebody else will have to pay for it through slightly higher interest rates indeed i may have done so myself somebody somewhere has to pay the finance and leasing association advises that between 80 and 90 per cent of cars are handed back not because people have got into financial difficulties but because that is the option available to them under those contracts as a consumer i have declared that interest and i may indeed take advantage of the situation given that it is legal there is no reason why people should not do so however that distorts the market and transfers to other people the responsibility of paying a fair price for the credit above all it is a distortion of contract law it is neither a satisfactory way of doing business nor is it beneficial to consumers or hire purchase companies it is an area of the law that needs looking into and if i am correct it emanates from the 1974 act which is 30 years out of date i ask for the ministers thoughts on the amendment and on the situation that i described the department has looked into the matter so he may surprise the committee and amaze me by accepting an amendment to the bill for the first time but i shall not hold my breath ", " it may be helpful to present this clause as clearly as possible if i explain to the committee the mischief that i seek to remove i want to give an example but it is by no means a single example it happens all too frequently a school in my constituency had been \u00a0 dealing with a company that supplied photocopiers the company had a change of personnel and told the school that it could offer a new deal on a new photocopier the school agreed the company said that there was no need to fill in any forms as there was a signature the company said that it would sort everything out the company duly supplied a new photocopierthe problem was that the photocopier was not financed by the company it was financed by a third party abbey national it turned out that the agreement for the photocopier had been fraudulently drawn up\u2014the police are investigating the matter as we speak the problem was that abbey national which had no part in the fraud but which had supplied the money asked for its \u00a314000 back the school is a primary school and \u00a314000 would have put a huge hole in its budget i got involved and i got the police involved eventually to abbey nationals credit it reduced the amount to be repaid to a more realistic \u00a34000 the difficulty was caused by the schools dispute with the company that supplied the photocopier that company was acting as a credit agent for abbey national to which the school owed money that is not an unusual situation it often happens with hire purchase agreements problems can however arise for example let us suppose that the minister is a car dealer from whom i purchase a car let us also suppose that you mr benton finance that purchase in that situation i have an ongoing relationship with the financier\u2014whom i have a duty to pay\u2014rather than with the car dealer were i to cease my payments you mr benton as the financier have a legal redress and may be able to seize the car i however have no such comeback with the minister the supplier of the car such relationships are subject to agency law which must be reexamined i seek to put a duty on the lender not to go into minute detail but to take all reasonable steps to ensure that his or her agent\u2014who provides people with perhaps several thousand pounds\u2014acts in a proper professional reasonable and legal manner it is not unreasonable to expect that were we to turn it on its head and say that the downside for abbey national\u2014to return to the case i cited\u2014would be that it would lose business are we thus saying that most of its dealings are with crooks that is not the case in english law credit providers or financial services sellers are heavily regulated\u2014they have to give best advice among other requirements there is a difficulty in that those who act as their agents do not have to give the same duty of care to the people they advise as a result some people can get into terribly complicated situations i return to the example of the car dealer there may be a way to get back to the initial dealer but it is almost necessary to go nuclear agency law must be reexamined i should be interested to hear whether the minister explored that area of law\u00a0", " as my hon friend the member for northeast bedfordshire alistair burt has said the minister has a reputation on the football field for letting nothing past him however that does not mean that the opposition stops trying in spite of the ministers detailed response i am not satisfied that these arrangements are in keeping with the spirit of natural justice at one point the minister said that if firms that were cleared of an accusation did not pay those that had cases proved against them would have to pay more well what is wrong with that that is in keeping with the spirit of natural justicei accept that there may have to be an annual fee so that the body can operate i do not dispute that neither does my amendment however it is not right that a firm should have to pay a fee when the case against it is not proven and indeed is thrown out that is simply not right therefore on this rare occasion the minister has failed to persuade me that we should let this one go as on the football field we shall have to try to slip this one past him i realise that he has the officials on his side just as he has on the football field but i do want to press the matter to a division question put that the amendment be made\u2014the committee divided ayes 5 noes 7", " i am following the hon gentlemans argument very carefully\u2014it is very persuasive it is purely my ignorance that causes me to intervene will he clarify how a creditcard cheque causes the customer to extend their credit limit i thought that it was more a matter of transferring credit i am not quite following that point", " i beg to move amendment no 44 in clause 60 page 49 line 41 at end add\u2014 16 no licensee shall have to pay to the ombudsman or its scheme operator any money until such time as the case is decided against him perhaps i could provide a little background on how i see the situation not just on the funding of the ombudsman scheme that clause 60 deals with but with the general principle i can illustrate my point with an example some time ago one of my constituents who was an independent financial adviser was reported by a client to the authorities he was charged \u00a3500 for the \u00a0 pleasure of having his case heard the complaint against him was dismissed and it might be reasonably assumed that he could claim back his \u00a3500 i am afraid that that was not the case that seems very wrong for two reasons first why should he pay anything when the case was dismissed that seems to fly in the face of justice we do not normally fine people who have not committed an offence secondly it gives rise to the possibility that vexatious litigants keep reporting someone whom they do not like until that person is bankrupt my amendment states  no licensee shall have to pay to the ombudsman or its scheme operator any money until such time as the case is decided against him i do not see what objection there could be to such an amendment i know that there is a precedent to the opposite effect and i know that it may affect other legislation however i do not see how it can be fair that people should have to pay what are in effect fines when they have done nothing wrong i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say ", " on a point of order mr benton a few minutes ago i tried to get into this room to retrieve papers and to prepare for the debate i was told that members could not enter the room until 230 pm i pointed out that the committee started at 230 pm and that that would make me late but i was still refused access i bumped into you in the corridor and protested further the person responsible for unlocking the room made another telephone call and was eventually told that hon members could enter the room once the chairman had appeared could you through your good offices and as a member of the chairmens panel look into this matter it seems very hit and miss indeed perhaps the way forward might be to agree a time say a quarter of an hour before the committee is due to sit some degree of certainty would be useful it was the most ridiculous situation and it should not occur again", " i beg to move amendment no 48 in schedule 1 page 55 line 24 at end insertor for any other reasonable reason providing that reason is stated welcome back to the chair mr benton the amendment relates to paragraph 4 of schedule 1 which deals with the terms of office of the members of the consumer credit appeals tribunal panel subparagraph 2 states  the lord chancellor may remove a member of either panel from office on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour the meaning of misbehaviour is perhaps obvious the meaning of incapacity might be open to some debate would it be helpful to the lord chancellor to have a slightly extended remit and to allow him to remove a member of the panel for any other reasonable reason provided that reason is stated\u00a0that might enable the lord chancellor to ensure that the panel is flexible and able to understand all the issues likely to come before it ", " the minister has given a sympathetic response but he appears to be fishing for more information from me i do not think that i can explore the matter any further", " i am happy to accept that i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn schedule 1 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " clause 56 concerns appeals to the consumer credit appeals tribunal in a wider context can all oft determinations be appealed to the tribunal does leave have to be sought or is there an automatic right of appeal perhaps the minister could clarify those two points", " i beg to move amendment no 42 in clause 54 page 44 line 34 at end insert who shall have the power to order that the statement of policy shall be amended if he is not satisfied with it clause 54 concerns a statement of policy in relation to civil penalties which the oft is obliged to publish proposed new section 39c3 in the 1974 act says no statement of policy shall be published without the approval of the secretary of statemy amendment is partly a probing amendment although not entirely i want to test what exactly subsection 3 means does it mean that the secretary of state must be satisfied with the details of that statement i would be happy if that were the case because hon members will recall that i have just once or twice been slightly critical of the oft and the extra powers it will gain i am happy for the secretary of state to be required to approve the statement before it is published that is the probing part to which i would like an answer my amendment however goes a little bit further and clarifies subsection 3 if that is not to be the case it gives the secretary of state the power to order that the statement of policy be amended if he is not satisfied\u2014in other words to avoid getting to the point at which he is not satisfied and then nothing seeming to happen from there on that is important because the ofts imposition of civil penalties is a serious matter it may turn out that the oft is too heavy handed in the way in which it imposes penalties or it may turn out that it is not heavy handed enough at some point the secretary of state should be able to affect that i will not go over the horse racing analogy which hon members had to sit through on tuesday in which the secretary of state could not intervene or make any particular difference however with a body as powerful as the oft the secretary of state should have some ability to affect what it does when i say the secretary of state i mean that parliament should have an ability to affect what the oft does i would like an explanation of that may i test your patience just for one minute mr benton this is the final clause that relates directly to the oft i remain concerned by the ofts power and \u00a0 by parliaments lack of ability to affect what it does the minister has said that the oft frequently appears in front of select committees but we all know that select committees do not have any power to affect what the oft does they can produce a damning report and that may or may not happen in the future but i remain concerned by the lack of parliamentary control over the oft and by hon members lack of ability to represent their constituents with regard to the way in which the oft works i would like to put that on the record the bill has added to my concerns in many ways and i have gone through those concerns in great detail i will not repeat them now but i do want to say that i am very concerned about it indeed ", " with the

figure in the bill but labour members were concerned that that figure might not be high enough in certain cases more particularly there is no provision in the bill for the minister to amend that figure by statutory instrument it may be that if we take another 30 years to revisit consumer credit\u2014which we may or may not do i do not know\u2014that figure of \u00a350000 could become rather

might not be long before \u00a350000 is not much more than a slap on the wrist for some companies i am trying to help the minister by tabling the amendment i am disappointed that none of his hon friends did so because the point was raised several times on second reading the amendment does not alter the maximum penalty set out in the bill i do not suggest that the figure of \u00a350000 be changed i suggest that the minister should be able to vary the figure in future if he thinks it necessary given the conditions at the time and possibly the seriousness of any offences that may \u00a0 be committed we do not know what will happen in future so it would be helpful for the minister to have that power i am not normally one for giving too much power to ministers but we must be realistic the bill could become irrelevant if it is another 30 years before the issue is revisited why is that power not in the bill the bill leaves many areas open in which a minister can intervene some of which are desirable some of which perhaps ask too much of a minister i am surprised that this subsection cannot be changed and i look forward to hearing the ministers explanation ", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation i accept that section 181 of the 1974 act covers the clause i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn ", " clause 48 deals with entry into premises under warrant clause 47 gives the oft the power to require access to premises but i presume that clause 48 is subsequent to that should the oft be refused that entry however if the oft has the legal power to enter premises does it not naturally flow that \u00a0 it should be granted a warrant to enter should entry be refused i wonder whether we are going a little too fari understand that there is a need to gather information in order to protect consumers but would it not be better to allow the courts to draw an inference from a refusal to allow entry rather than to give them the power to grant a warrant if some of the wording of the clause had been different i might not have wished to speak about it for example proposed new section 36d3 states that a warrant gives an officer the right a to enter the premises specified in the warrantb to search the premises and to seize and detain any information or documents appearing to be information or documents specified in the warrant or information or documents of a description so specifiedif the court has such a degree of detail is there a need to enter the premises in the first instance it also provides for the power to use such force as may be reasonably necessarythat alarms me it is not clear who is allowed to use such force is it an officer of the oft perhaps i am getting into an area that i do not quite understand but the wording in the bill on the right to obtain a warrant and to enter premises alarms me i wonder whether such officers will be of a certain description or given a certain legal right i am troubled by that and before accepting the clause i would like an explanation of why it is felt that the courts should be able to issue such a warrant and more particularly why there is a need for some of the wording in the bill ", " i appreciate the ministers attempt to define reasonable force which could simply mean breaking open a locked cupboard but it could also mean much more if i may draw an analogy we had a spirited debate recently in parliament about the use of reasonable force to protect ones home and there is much uncertainty about what that term means it troubles me that reasonable force may include much more than breaking open a locked cupboard i am concerned about giving that degree of power which ordinarily is given only to police officers\u2014who are directly accountable\u2014for entering premises what grade of officer will be given the power to use reasonable force i am very troubled by subsection 3d and i ask the minister whether he is prepared to reconsider it", " i am sorry if the minister thinks that i have become unbalanced i assure him that i am not unbalanced\u2014not in this instance anywayproposed new section 36d3b states that the warrant gives the right to search the premises and to seize and detain any information    specified in the warranttherefore courts are already aware of the documents that are required in a short but telling intervention my hon friend the member for northeast bedfordshire highlighted the uncertain nature of subsection 3d what happens if a licensee stands in front of a cupboard or at a front door the minister tells us that force cannot be used against that person courts know what documents are required and given that it is normal practice for them to call for documents would it not be better to do that when the case comes to court ", " i am grateful for the ministers explanation i did say that mine was a technical amendment although probing might have been a better word i am grateful to my hon friend for his eloquent argument in favour of some degree of certainty that would lead to protection i am concerned that people should contribute to the drawing up of the guidelines not merely because i do not want the oft to be too powerful but because i want consumers and licensees to make a fair contribution i am sure that the minister will ensure that that is the case therefore i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn \u00a0clause 42 ordered to stand part of the bill clauses 43 to 46 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 35 in clause 47 page 38 line 27 at end insert\u20147a it shall be the duty of the oft to take all reasonable steps to ensure that its own officers or those of the enforcement agency shall when entering and while on the premises by virtue of this section at all times behave in a reasonable and professional manner i assure the minister that i shall not press the amendment to a division as it too is a probing amendment however it is a continuation of my concern about the oft clause 47 gives the oft power to require access to premises clause 48 gives the oft power of entry to premises under warrant that is quite an extension of the ofts powers they are i suppose similar to the powers of her majestys customs and excise its considerable powers are familiar to any businessman perhaps they are required i do not know amendment no35 requires the oft to ensure that anyone entering premises either as their own agent or as agents of other enforcement authorities should behave in a proper and professional manner that is not an unreasonable requirement it is a probing amendment because there are many requirements on business and on licensees to cooperate i am however concerned about the powers granted to the oft i ask the minister to address not merely the amendment but also to give the committee an explanation of what supervision he envisages for the oft when it has such powers of entry it will concern licensees greatly ", " i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn clause 47 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 33 in clause 42 page 33 line 27 leave out subsection 3 and insert\u20143 the oft shall have the duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the revised guidance is brought to the attention of those likely to be affected by it ", " these are technical amendments clause 42 concerns guidance on requirements of licensees whereas clause 54 relates to statement of policy in relation to civil penalties the amendments seek to place on the oft a duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure that anyone who is likely to be affected by the guidance is notified when drawing up that guidance the oft should also have a duty to consult \u00a0 such persons as it thinks fit however that is already in the bill i seek only to add to that to include a representative sample of those whom it is likely to affectwhat does the minister have to say about technical amendments i reckon i can guess but perhaps they will be moved ", " does the minister always have the benefit of the officials on his side", " i beg to move amendment no 32 in clause 34 page 27 line 39 at end insert\u20141e in all cases the oft shall state its reason for allowing for a limited period only when the application was for an indefinite period and those reasons shall be consistent with the guidelines the oft itself sets out i too welcome you to the committee mr benton as the minister said it has been conducted in a professional and convivial manner i am sure that that will continue under your chairmanship amendment no 32 deals with the length of time for which licences will be given as i understand it licences are currently renewed every five years the clause will enable a move towards licences having effect indefinitely however there is a caveat which is that the office of fair trading can refuse to give an openended licence if it thinks that there is good reason why one should have effect for a limited period only my amendment seeks to ask the oft to state its reason for not giving an indefinite licence i accept that there are many instances when the oft should look at the way in which a licensee conducts business one of the bills general objectives is to allow the oft to do that in between issuing licences as legislation permits at the moment but on a rolling basis when those licences are indefinite all i ask is that the oft when it varies the granting of indefinite licences should give a reason for doing so what i ask may be seen as yet another assault on the power of the oft and i make no apology for that i have said previously and will probably say again that the oft has too much power it is rather a free spirit and that has not always been to the benefit of the business that it is supposed to regulate i make no apology for wanting to try to clip its wings a bit ", " but", " the oft may give reasons but i do not know that it is required to do so the minister referred to the 1974 act which requires the oft to give reasons however the act does not refer to openended licences as they did not exist in 1974 the bill will introduce them my amendment is desirable for technical reasons but on this occasion i shall not press it to a division", " i am grateful for that explanation i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn clause 34 ordered to stand part of the bill clauses 35 to 37 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 46 in clause 38 page 30 line 30 leave out from first licensee to end of linethe clause gives power to the oft to impose requirements on licensees proposed new section 33a1a will apply when the oft is dissatisfied with any matter that is in connection with\u2014 a business being carried on or which has been carried on by a licensee or\u2014this is the crucial bit\u2014 by an associate or a former associate of a licenseethe implication is that if the behaviour of a former associate of a licensee has been inappropriate the oft can impose requirements and either rescind a licence or not grant it that is possibly unfair and rather open \u00a0 ended if by former associate is meant one who was an associate a month ago the oft probably has a right and a duty to investigate the relationship and perhaps to act on it however if an association ended a year two years or five years ago should the oft still be required to investigate it should the oft be given the same power to rescind the licence because of a relationship that existed a long time ago i raised a point at our last sitting on clause 292ad at the last sitting which sets out some of the criteria for deciding whether people are fit to hold licences one example that the oft was considering was somebody who has practised discrimination on grounds of sex colour race or ethnic or national origin and so on that is an allencompassing subsection and at the last sitting i condemned such behaviour however i did not see the relevance of the provision under this clause not only could the licensee be held responsible for any malpractice in that sense but it seems that his former associates could also be held responsible again i am concerned about the power of the oft in that regard especially when the clause and subsection seem rather vague and open ended i would appreciate the ministers explanation as to why that particular wording is in the bill it is not the only instance of it but this is probably where it is of most concern ", " i may have interrupted the minister too early as he might well explain what i am about to ask this may sound ridiculous considering the ministers explanation but can former associate refer to a former spouse my concern is about the former associate", " given the ministers explanation i think that he has a point however the wording is still far too open ended as a former associate who is still alive could presumably be a former associate of someone with whom they dealt previously will he undertake not to change the clause but to consider a better way of wording it", " given the ministers willingness to consider a clearer wording to achieve what he rightly wants to achieve i am prepared to withdraw my amendment i am still a little concerned about the provision extending not only to business relationships but to personal relationships i can see the point of it but i can also see the danger i am unhappy about the openended wording but given the ministers undertaking i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn  question proposed that the clause stand part of the bill \u00a0", "to ask the secretary of state for

resolution vary the guidance or issue further guidance to the office of fair trading oft with \u00a0regard to this section and the oft shall then be required to have due regard to this guidance ", " the amendment gives the secretary of state the right by order subject to affirmative resolution to vary the guidance or issue further guidance to the oft about this section the oft is then obliged to have due regard to that guidanceover recent months i have become increasingly concerned about the ofts considerable powers which it does not always use in the most fair sensible and sensitive way about 15 or 16 months ago an adjournment debate in my name was held in the house of commons on horse racing the oft was investigating the way in which horse racing was being operated and regulated the industry was fearful of the outcome of that investigation the matter was of particular concern to me as a lover of horse racing but more relevantly it is very important to my constituency the cheltenham racecourse is some might say the jewel in its crown it was frustrating to discuss that issue in the house of commons because it became apparent that there was nothing that we could do to influence the ofts deliberations in fact it refused to meet us i realise that the minister would have had greater access that the oft could act as a court seemingly exempt from anyones jurisdiction was wrong even the minister was unable to affect its decision i hope that he will not mind my quoting his words at the time i am sure that the hon member for tewkesbury will understand that the matters being considered by the office of fair trading fall within its ambit so it would be inappropriate for me as a minister with responsibility for competition to seek to intervene in its deliberations\u2014official report 18 september 2003 vol 410 c 1136i understand that to an extent however what that means is that a member of parliament has no right to take a case to the oft regardless of its importance to their constituency there was nowhere for me to go that rather long preamble is the background to this amendment the oft should be under parliamentary control i do not want to see everything centralised or the minister running the oft on a daytoday basis that is not why the oft was set up and i would not find that desirable however it can be demonstrated through parliament that there is something wrong with the way in which the oft goes about its business given that the minister generally accepts the points made\u2014as he and indeed the sports minister did on that occasion\u2014and that we are powerless to do anything ministers should have the ability to act when they consider it to be reasonable that is the basis of amendment no 26 ", " if the minister finds that the oft is not issuing appropriate guidelines to bring about the intentions of the bill particularly that of providing fairness is there anything that he can do without resorting to primary legislation i am keen to avoid bureaucracy but i believe that my way of avoiding it is less cumbersome than his", " the minister said that there was no crossover between the horse racing analogy and this matter but his answer proves that there is i asked a direct question can he intervene and bring about a change in the guidance his answer was longhand for no", " how", " the analogy that i drew was an exact one the minister admitted that he could not instruct the oft to\u2014", " i inferred that the minister said that he could not instruct the oft to change the guidelines", " we must leave that for history to judge but it strikes me that if we do not put in the bill something along the lines of my amendment it could \u00a0 lead to inappropriate guidelines and that would in turn lead to the same situation that we saw in the horse racing industry that situation could have been terminal for that industry it was very serious and i do not wish to see it replicated i have made my point i look around the committee room and see that i am unable to win the vote even if i were to press it i shall not waste the committees time in so doing i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn question proposed that the clause as amended stand part of the bill ", " may i just take a few moments of the committees time to ask\u2014interruption i do not know whether that refers to me i ask for clarification as to why subsection 2ad is relevant to the bill in so asking i am happy to condemn discrimination on the grounds of sex colour race or ethnic or national origins and indeed many other forms of discrimination during the lunchtime break i asked a question in the chamber on ethiopia and eritrea \u00a0 international development as you are well aware sir john is one of my passions however i do not see the relevance of that to this clause i hope that vexatious litigants will not seek to prevent otherwise goodstanding people from running their businesses and being awarded licences i can see the relevance of that paragraph to general life but i cannot see the relevance to the clause i would appreciate an explanation", " i thank my hon friend for that good point in many ways it is more important than mine the information may be inaccurate the accounts may be sloppy but fraud is also an issue when i was in business i had a dispute with a supplier who had given me faulty goods i refused to pay for them as was my right the company took me to court and the case was struck out however the credit reference company had recorded the case as a county court judgment against me\u2014another instance of sloppy recordkeeping i only found that out while conducting another business transaction and it became a problem i told the credit company to remove the inaccurate information from its records the company contacted leeds county court and it was taken off the record however on a subsequent occasion the same credit reference company still had that judgment on my record even though it was wrong given the amount of time i spent dealing with that problem and the business opportunities i could have lost because a company was saying things about me that were demonstrably untrue i should have been able to say to them im sorry but you owe me some compensation not only have you done this once but twice that is the mischief that the amendment seeks to remove", " i am grateful to my hon friend some people can deal with those situations although that does not mean that it is not stressful timeconsuming and costly for them however other people are unable to deal with such problemsthe data protection act 1998 gives people the right to find out what is on their record however as i found out it is difficult to get the record changed\u2014even for someone as bolshy as i am there must be some form of redress if demonstrably wrong information is being released that is the mischief that i seek to remove with the amendment ", " i am pleased that the problem is in part covered elsewhere however i am still concerned as the minister said that the provision relates only to individuals therefore although that provision is welcome it needs to be extended i do not wish to detain the committee if by and large this point has been covered however i ask the minister to consider through this bill or another bill extending the provision to companies because as i said earlier a company can be one man or woman", " given the ministers response i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn clause 25 ordered to stand part of the bill clause 26 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " how will the charges for licences be set it is not entirely clear what right of appeal would applicants have \u00a0", " i beg to move amendment no 24 in clause 22 page 16 line 6 leave out alleges and insert demonstratesi was concerned by the word alleges because it is easy to allege without substantiation in discussing on the previous clause i spoke at great length about being clear as to what was an unfair agreement the subsection that i seek to amend states if in proceedings referred to in section 140b2 the debtor or a surety alleges that the relationship between the creditor and the debtor is unfair to the debtor it is for the creditor to prove to the contrarythe question is whether that shifts the burden of proof i understand that the minister will respond by saying that it does not but it depends if a creditor takes the matter to court that is one thing but for a debtor to take the matter to court is quite another with regard to the burden of proof however if the debtor \u00a0 only has to allege that it is unfair in order to require the creditor to prove to the contrary that is not a strong enough word there must be some demonstration from the person who has taken the matter to court that it is unfair otherwise there could be frivolous claims the bill seeks not necessarily to achieve anything for consumers or for lenders but to achieve fairness in dealings to allege something is a bit weak and i would rather replace that with demonstrate ", " there is the case that it is quoted in the 1974 act and i accept that however my amendment was not based on that normally allegations must be proved there is a legal difference in this situation it would be easy to allege something without having to produce evidence\u2014for example without having to show that a loan was taken out at x per cent when similar loans are at x minus 10 per cent however in the interest of time i shall not press the matter i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn clause 22 ordered to stand part of the bill clauses 23 and 24 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 25 in clause 25 page 18 line 6 at end insert\u20142a it shall be the responsibility of individuals partnerships companies or organisations acting as credit information services as defined in section 7b0 of the 1974 act or acting as credit reference agencies as defined in subsection 8 of section 145 of the 1974 act to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the information which they store on any individual partnership company or organisation and which they impart to a third party is accurate uptodate and gives a true reflection of the credit record of the said individual partnership company or organisation 2aa failure to take the steps identified in subsection 2a shall give rise to the opportunity for the individual partnership company or organisation to seek compensation through the civil courts for the keeping of inaccurate information i attempted to address this amendment prematurely a few moments ago it refers to credit agencies that store information on our behalf then pass it on to third parties when asked i have always been concerned at how some of those companies operate and i raise the issue seeking to strike a balance as the minister said credit can be good and reasonable\u2014for example when people borrow for houses motor cars or business purposes however many people cannot get credit or borrow money because of their credit references it is important that people keep good credit records in order to avoid situations such as the tragic case that we \u00a0 heard about earlier of the poor gentleman with 22 credit cards that is undesirable but it might have happened because of inadequacies in a credit rating system rather than the system being too prescriptive i regret those situations just as i also regret the fact that good and decent people of reasonably sound financial standing are turned down for credit we are all aware of how credit agencies work some years ago just after i had moved house i wanted to take out a shortterm loan for some reason that i cannot remember i was turned down so i asked why i was told that it was because of the credit reference however the credit reference had nothing to do with me it concerned the people who had lived in the house previously i examined their record and it was disastrous i could well understand why nobody wanted to lend them money however that was not my position it was a very sloppy way to do business and it could have become a problem for people who were trying to get credit at a time either of personal difficulty or alternatively at a time of great opportunity because their situation might have become worse or they could have lost that opportunity in other areas of life the provision of incorrect information can often give rise to the right to seek compensation through this amendment i propose that credit agencies should be responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the information which they store on any individual partnership company or organisation and which they impart to a third party is accurate uptodate and gives a true reflection of the credit record of the said individual partnership company or organisationthe amendment also proposes that failure to take the reasonable steps identified in subsection 2a shall give rise to the opportunity for the individual partnership company or organisation to seek compensation through the civil courts for the keeping of inaccurate informationthat is a departure from the present law\u2014or the present lack of law the issue concerns me greatly i do not know whether this is the best approach or whether my amendments are worded as well as they could be but the issue must be tackled it places no additional regulation or burden on companies by analogy other organisations such as banks solicitors offices or accountancy firms have a duty of care to the client the question is who is the client a credit agencys client might well be the company that applies to them for the credit reference but there is still a duty of care to the person on whom information is being kept ", " i agree that the extortionate credit test does not work nevertheless elements of it are quite prescriptive we are repealing those it is not just a matter of adding the clause on unfairness we are actually repealing some of the details of section 138 of the 1974 act we are removing 1382athe comparison of interest rates prevailing at the time it was madein a sense we are moving backwards ", " the right hon gentleman mentioned the term better regulation and that is what i wanted to press for", " i do not agree with the point made by the hon member for edinburgh north and leith because clause 192a statesin particular when determining whether an agreement is unfair the court should consider\u2014however that does not mean that nothing else could be considered on the hon gentlemans other point about whether the initial terms of the agreement might be considered unfavourable i accept that that may be considered a little prescriptive but section 138 of the consumer credit act 1974 is even more prescriptive section 1383a and b mention age experience business \u00a0 capacity state of health and the degree to which a person was under financial pressure at the time of making the credit bargain i do not claim that that is the right approach but it is our approach for tackling the meaning of the word extortion however we have absolutely no guidance for tackling the meaning of the word unfair before the hon gentleman made his helpful intervention we were having an exchange with the minister about his ability to introduce a statutory instrument to give guidance to the courts i am not satisfied that he has that ability under the bill and i cannot see that he has it under the 1974 act because it does not address unfairness i am not a lawyer and i would gladly be corrected on that matter however i am concerned that he would not have the opportunity to introduce those statutory instruments ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for clarifying that matter how do we give that guidance to the courts", " i accept those comparisons however a mass of employment law comes into play alongside the term unfair while i accept that i have been corrected to some extent my point may also have been proven because the mass of employment law makes it easier to define unfairness whereas it is not easy to determine that in this matter", " i am grateful to my hon friend who is a lawyer and knows more about these issues than i do we have probably exhausted that point but it will be important to gain a degree of certainty not \u00a0 only for the industry but for the debtor because on the matter of establishing unfairness a case could be brought by the creditor\u2014or indeed the debtor\u2014if i have read the clause correctly there needs to be more certainty however i fear that several court cases will be heard before we achieve that certaintymy amendment refers to amendment no 17 which fell after i pressed it to the vote my amendment asks the court to consider whether the lender has set out the exact terms of the agreement the court should then ask whether the lender has complied with all the requirements of the bill and the 1974 act when determining whether an agreement is unfair it should also ask whether the initial terms of the agreement might be considered to be unfavourable to the debtor when compared to other similar agreements that is not a new concept it was part of section 138 of the original consumer credit act 1974 no government considered it so unreasonable that they hastened to change it\u2014it has taken 30 years to get to that point proposed new section 140a2ad refers to whether the running of the agreement might be considered to be significantly unfair to the debtor when taking into account the relative financial strength of the parties to the agreementthat concept is already in the legislation that we are seeking to amend the amendment seeks to cover the establishment and the operation of the agreement and there is scope to discuss its terms there is also scope for arguing whether something is unfair or asking how far one has to vary from what is normal before it becomes unfair i accept that that is a difficulty and i sympathise with the minister obtaining certainty of advice is difficult i reiterate the comments of the hon member for richmond park dr tonge in that the longer that i work on the bill the less certain i become that we will be able to protect vulnerable people from debt extortionate charges interests rates compound interest and default fees all of which lead to problems such as those that we heard about on the radio this morning citizens advice has published an interesting briefing that details horrendous stories about how people borrow \u00a31000 and end up owing \u00a330000 members are aware of those situations unless the bill is clearer such cases will continue to exist it is too easy to borrow money after christmas i went into marks and spencer which is a reputable company where i paid around \u00a3200 for several items mainly clothes i was not really paying attention i was hot since i had my coat on i was carrying many messages and i wanted to get out of the store i was informed that if i subscribed to a store card which i imagined to be similar to a petrol card on which one can amass points i could get 10 per cent off my purchases that would have saved \u00a320 pounds i filled in the form and did not think any more of it until a card appeared in the post about a week later on the accompanying piece of paper bigger than any other writing was the \u00a37500 credit limit that occurred without me really thinking about what i was doing so it serves me right i do not seek to blow my own trumpet i am not particularly financially literate i suppose that the company did a credit check but they \u00a0 certainly did not know much about me i was later informed that the card was not a store card but a mastercard that could be used anywhere that was a doublewhammy to coin an old phrase ", " it certainly is a good phrase however i digress sir john i was alarmed presumably i could have gone out and spent that money that same day i did not and i will not spend it because i do not believe that debt for debts sake is a good thing that is one recent example", " i gave the example to support the remarks of the hon member for richmond park about it being too easy to obtain credit and money i wonder how it was possible for the gentleman of the poor widow who was on the radio this morning to obtain 22 credit cardsit is certainly not for the government to determine whether i should get a marks and spencer store card it is none of the governments business and i did not come into politics to encourage the government to interfere more in peoples daily lives\u2014quite the reverse however there is a massive amount of personal debt in this country which is not entirely due to house prices and not entirely asset backed it is a big problem for some people\u2014i do not know how many not everybody who has borrowed money is in trouble i borrowed money for my house and my car i am not in trouble with that but many people are i am concerned about peoples inability to ensure that they are treated fairly because they are not lawyers and do not necessarily understand what constitutes a contract i do not think that many people understand what the essential ingredients of a contract are people seem to think that if a big company states that it can charge x for a letter or for a default on a payment it is entitled to do so many people are not financially literate most certainly have no legal training or indeed legal knowledge i am concerned that the government help those people and prevent them from being ripped off no one is concerned about honest agreements that involve for example people taking out loans that they can pay off at an interest rate of 5 per cent i am not suggesting that the government should restrict the number of products available i do not think that they could if they wanted to however i am concerned that protection is afforded to people who are not financially literate or legally educated i am not sure that the bill goes far enough in doing that ", " i think not for the first time that the hon gentleman makes a very good point my amendment no 25 deals with credit reference agencies and although my intention was slightly different it may just cover his point it is probably largely up to the industry but if companies were not so able to rip some people off as they are they might not be so quick to lend money without taking into account peoples circumstances there is probably a logical thread in thatif we apply to borrow money for a house our income is checked if we try to top that up more than our income allows we will not be lent the money that is because it is not as easy for those companies to rip others off to compensate for bad loans that they may have made in the credit card and in the loan shark industry\u2014if i may put it so crudely\u2014that is not the case it is a bit like thirdworld debt some organisations have lent money at extortionate rates of interest to compensate for the possibility that country b may not repay them we have a similar situation and i am not sure how effectively the government can deal with it they can act by reducing the burden of the test from extortion to unfairness i welcome that but let us clarify the matter so that we can squeeze out those who simply lend money to anyone i do not know how on earth that poor gentleman got 22 credit cards i do not think that many of us would be able to do that but it is obvious that some people can i hope that i have made the case for defining the word unfairness i accept that my amendment is not perfectly worded and that parts of it are better than others but it is a genuine attempt to help the government with the bill rather than to get in the way ", " we have had a very good discussion on this and indeed the previous amendment and that makes it unnecessary for me to repeat many of the arguments that have been made however the committee would be disappointed if i did not refer to my own amendment no 23 in some detail i admit that its drafting may not be perfect the opposition do not have the benefit of officials or parliamentary draftsmen i do not say that maliciously it is true but it may not have captured exactly what i was thinking however i have tried to help to define unfairsection 138 of the 1974 act goes into some detail about what extortion is whereas the bill does not go into any detail on what is meant by unfair i am a bit surprised that the bill does not go into the same degree of detail for example section 138 2a mentions interest rates prevailing at the time regardless of whether we wish to compare what lender a offers and lender b offers my point is that the act goes into far more detail about what is meant by extortion than the bill goes into about what is meant by unfair when introducing a new concept into english law\u2014and the test of unfairness is a new concept\u2014we need to be a bit more prescriptive the most important word in the english legal system is probably the word reasonable i do not suppose that that word is defined anywhere but the assumption is that what is reasonable is what the man on the clapham omnibus \u00a0 thinks is reasonable what test do we have for the meaning of the word unfair i suspect that it will be a matter of several court judgments before we establish precedent and are able to operate in the industry with any degree of certainty there will be a time\u2014from now until those court judgements have been made\u2014in which there will be a great deal of uncertainty not only in the minds of consumers but also in the mind of the industry i said this morning that one of the biggest concerns about the bill is that it is so uncertain and vague in so many areas this clause in particular has excited the industry more than any other in the bill because people simply do not know what unfair means people also do not know how the definition will be determined the exchange that we had a few moments ago with the minister did not satisfy me that we have made any progress on that ", " may i ask the minister for a point of clarification i am not trying to trip him up\u2014i know he will have the answer under which clause or subsection will the minister or the secretary of state be able to issue guidance to the courts", " i am grateful to the minister for that however i am not sure\u2014i am not a lawyer\u2014that the bill provides that opportunity the minister is getting advice i would like to hear what that advice is because i would like the matter cleared up i would be very pleased to be proved wrong", " i may be getting into water deeper than i can cope with not being a lawyer but with respect that is not what i asked i asked what opportunity there is for the minister to introduce a statutory instrument to guide the courts the minister said that the office of fair trading may be able to offer guidance but i am not sure to what extent the minister can guide the oft he knows that we have had that dispute on a separate matter which we will return to later in the bill nowhere on the face of the bill is there an opportunity for the minister to issue \u00a0 guidelines to the court about the meaning of unfairness that would be sufficiently close enough for interpretation by the court", " they are not", " i did not withdraw amendment no 17 i pressed it to a vote as acceptance of the amendment would\u2014", " i hope that the minister enjoyed his lunch i am sure that it was rather better than my lunch in the tea room", " such indeed i did not withdraw amendment no 17 because its acceptance would have improved the world of consumer credit in the sense that it would have required the lender to set out clearly the terms of the agreement into which the borrower was entering however it was lost amendment no 22 is consequential on that so i do not intend to press it to the vote it is important that the lender set out clearly the detailed terms of the agreement so that the borrower has no illusions about what he is entering into or the consequences of any default given that i did not win that vote i do not suppose that i shall win \u00a0 this one so i shall not trouble the committee any further with it i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn ", " will the minister consider extending the restriction to arrears generally or has that been ruled unnecessary or undesirable people get into trouble on arrears generally not only on defaults if a lender attracts simple interest on the arrears or the default the money will be repaid with interest did the minister consider extending the restriction to that extent arrears are potentially more dangerous for borrowers than defaults", "what recent discussions he has had with the government of eritrea about the boundary dispute with ethiopia and if he will make a statement", "i thank the minister for that response at a meeting with the prime minister of ethiopia in november he affirmed his commitment to a peaceful solution with eritrea and indeed wanted to accept what he did not like in terms of the border dispute\u2014he accepted the ruling of the boundary commission indeed in november the parliament of ethiopia passed a motion to that effect recently however ethiopia has been expressing deep concern about the attitude of eritrea towards the boundary solution there is concern that that country which is not democratic and does not have a free press might seek to return to war that would of course cause devastation in the area loss of life and loss of aid will the minister redouble his efforts to discuss the situation particularly with eritrea with a view to persuading that country that the peaceful way forward has to be the only way forward", " i am seeking to protect consumers but also to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy being piled on top of lenders the companies that deal with small loans often have a far more flexible approach to business and while debtors with small loans may end up paying a higher interest rate the fact that there is flexibility within the agreement can change its nature however there may not be the same charges such as those incurred when writing to people as part of the terms of agreements that is one reason why i shall resist interest rate ceilings because the interest rate as the hon member for leeds west said is not the entire storyi accept that the interest rate may be a little bit higher on those loans but all i am saying is that the period before the big machine goes into action writing letters to people should be six weeks rather than four that is not a revolutionary proposal ", " i do not accept that i am proposing that people be treated any differently our only point of disagreement is the interval between failing to make a payment and when the letters start to arrive i do not seek a different rule or a different law the government are increasing the period from two weeks to four so they have recognised that they do not want the whole machinery of bureaucracy to begin too early all i am saying is that they should have relaxed that bureaucracy slightly morethe other point about small agreements is relevant i suppose that if that were a little higher my amendment would be taken care of but i shall not stretch the committees patience we have had a bit of a debate on the point and i do not want to press the amendment to a vote i am happy to have got on the record my concern about there being a little bit too much bureaucracy and that said i understand the ministers position i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdrawn clause 9 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 22 in clause 12 page 10 line 23 at end insert\u20146a the debtor shall not be required to pay a default sum unless the liability to do so is clearly set out in the statement as required under subsection 7 of section 6 of this act the amendment takes us back to what i was saying about statements setting out exactly what a lender is entitled to charge it basically refers to debtors who will not be required to pay a default sum unless the liability to do so is clearly set out in the statement i made the case for the statement under an earlier set of amendments and there is no need to do so again but i really do think that that would form a very important part of the original statement were there to be an original statement\u2014 it being twentyfive minutes past eleven oclock the chairman adjourned the committee without question put pursuant to the standing order adjourned accordingly till this day at halfpast two oclock ", " i beg to move amendment no 18 in clause 8 page 6 line 35 at end insert but shall include\u2014 a details of the rights of consumers under this act and the 1974 act with regard to defaults and b details of redress procedures available to debtors with particular respect to the financial services ombudsman and the financial services authority ", " the amendments follow on from amendment no 17 and address the same problem amendment no18 asks that the rights of redress procedures available to debtors be clearly laid out and that the rights of consumers under this bill and the 1974 act with regard to defaults be carried out it seeks to reinforce the point that the company should be allowed only to do what it originally stated it would do it should be set out very clearly to debtors what their position is under this bill and under the 1974 act \u00a0 what their rights of redress are and what they are legally liable to pay i spoke comprehensively on those matters in the discussion of amendment no 17 so i shall allow the minister to put forward his line of thinking", " let me pick up on the ministers closing comments the amendments would not put a further burden on the industry they are simple requirements the details of the rights of consumers under the bill and under the 1974 act would be set out in a standard document it would not place any extra burdens on businesses i note that the minister will consult with the industry yet again i wish him well in those consultations and on the strength of that i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn question proposed that the clause stand part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 20 in clause 9 page 8 line 6 leave out four and insert sixthe amendment relates to the notice of sums in arrears on fixed sum credit agreements by and large i support the requirements of clause 9 my only slight problem which i have discussed with the industry relates to subsection 8 which refers to weekly payments normally payments are made monthly but there are occasions particularly among lower income groups where repayments are made weekly my simple amendment seeks to address that the current requirement is that if two payments are missed notices must be sent that is to be increased to four payments but four payments may not cover a tremendously long time several very small loan agreements may be repaid at the rate of \u00a35 a week or so and i am persuaded that the industry that operates in that market is often flexible money is collected on the doorstep it is not sent by direct debit a relationship can build up between the collector and the debtor and it may be seen as heavyhanded if notices of missed payments and suggestions to seek advice on debt are sent too quickly when arrears are only approximately \u00a320 i want to do my bit to improve the bill in that respect by preventing it from being too heavyhanded in those circumstances ", " the hon lady makes a fair point but i am concerned the industry itself is pressing for eight weeks but i have suggested six which i think is a reasonable compromise as i have said i am arguing for two points of view i am arguing for the protection of the borrower but also that we should not have too much administration bureaucracy and regulation heaped on top of what is a successful credit industry the mischief that the bill seeks to deal with does not exist too much in the small loans sector that is why i have compromised by suggesting six weeks rather than eight it would be a little heavyhanded for somebody who is perhaps only \u00a320 behind in payment under the terms of their agreement to start to receive letters that suggest taking debt advice and counselling on debt it is too heavyhanded i cannot put it any clearer than thati wish to pick up on another point i am straying slightly from my amendment so you can rule me out of order sir john if i stray too far in subsection 9b reference is made to a small agreement it is my understanding that a small agreement is now \u00a350 \u00a0 which is a very low sum indeed has the minister any intention to increase that i am straying way beyond the thrust of the amendment so i will stop there ", " thank you sir john", " may i pick up on the ministers point that the provision would be too late once the agreement had been set up i do not see it that way the amendment calls for a statement at the outset of the agreement by implication that is when the agreement is made i understand that there is a twoweek coolingoff period for agreements those two weeks could be used to read the statement to see whether in the cold light of day the debtor actually agreed to what was written down and that it was in fact what he intended to agree tothe problem is that the system is not working people are getting into terrible debt and some companies\u2014i stress that it is only some\u2014are changing the terms of agreements as they go along it may or may not be legal to do that and i suspect that it probably is not but it is still happening and we must address it i intend to do that with the amendment amendments nos 18 19 and 21 which are the next group also deal with the way agreements should be run in respect of default payments and we will come to that the bill should address the relative strength of the parties and in spite of the ministers eloquence and detailed information i must insist on this amendment question put that the amendment be made\u2014the committee divided ayes 4 noes 9", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman and we can probably return to those points when we debate amendment no 17 he is right and i am glad of his explanation of the isosceles triangle i shall look for them the next time that i go into my local storei am unable to support amendment no 30 because of the way in which it is worded there are problems with subsection ewhich states that a lender shall be obliged to give free and impartial advice to the debtor as to alternative products i am not sure that that would be legal under the financial services and markets act 2000 although the minister will know more about that than i do i think that it is correct to say that people are entitled to give advice only on the products that they are licensed to sell however i agree with the spirit of amendment no 30 and i have tried to clarify the matter a little with amendment no 16 the minister reacted slightly strongly to an earlier point that i made although i was not criticising the bill many people are concerned that it is vague in \u00a0 many ways and that it gives a lot of regulatory power to the minister i do not doubt that consumer credit will be regulated very well while the minister is in office but he may well not be in office after 5 may even if the unthinkable happened and the labour government were reelected he might not continue to be responsible for this matter i am a little concerned about how much extra power the bill will give to ministers in amendment no 16 i have not tried to strike out what is already in the bill but i added that the statement shall include    the amount paid by the debtor to the lender to date    the amount remaining to be paid by the debtor to the lender and    the remaining term of the agreement those are very simple requirements like the hon member for richmond park i do not see a problem in clarifying that part of the bill ", " i beg to move amendment no 17 in clause 6 page 5 line 37 at end insert\u2014 7a in addition to the statement referred to in subsection 1 above the lender shall also provide the debtor with a statement at the outset of the agreement  7b regulations may make provisions about the form and content of the statements under 7a but the contents shall include a clear guide as to\u2014 a the redress procedures available to the debtor if any dispute regarding the agreement shall arise with particular respect to the financial services ombudsman and the financial services authority\u00a0b sources of information and advice with regard to the debtors rights under the terms of this act and the 1974 act and c any charges other than interest payments which the lender may legitimately make the amendment places a requirement on the lender to provide the debtor with a statement at the outset of the agreement that is frequently done but this would be a little more prescriptive it allows the minister to set regulations about the form and content of the statement but it also specifies what should be in that statement including among other things the redress procedures available to the debtor should any dispute regarding the agreement arise i refer particularly to the financial services ombudsman who will be discussed later in the bill and the financial services authority the amendment also requires them to be told of sources of information and advice with regard to the debtors rights under the terms of this bill and the 1974 act it also requires\u2014this is probably the most important part\u2014that any charges other than interest payments which the lender may legitimately make must be put on this statement which must be given to debtors at the beginning of the contract i was persuaded to table this amendment because financial institutions all too often seem to make the rules up as they go along charges are levied that i am sure are not necessarily part of the contract what particularly annoys people is that organisations write to individuals and then as i said charge them \u00a330 or \u00a340 for the privilege of having been written to some years ago i had a loan towards the end of which i had a dispute with the company i had to instruct a solicitor to sort it out i was successful in doing so\u2014i was right and they were wrong\u2014but they insisted on writing to me and charging me \u00a330 for every letter they sent i wrote back saying that is very good i charge \u00a350 for every letter i send you so you owe me \u00a3x not everyone would have my nerve or confidence and vulnerable people certainly would not they would lose out perhaps in a legal sense but also simply because of the relative strength of the parties involved as i described earlier therefore for the agreement to be legal and this would be consistent with every other area of law in the country the lender should have to state very clearly not only the terms of the agreement but what will happen if x y or z happens the debtor would then have a much clearer idea about the agreement into which he is entering and much bad faith and bad feeling would be avoided the redress procedures available are important and it would benefit consumers to be aware of them i do not see why it should be against the interests of decent and honourable lenders to have to give information and sources of information that relate to the debtors right under the terms of the bill and the 1974 act i raised a point about such agreements on second reading which requires clarification i shall attempt to put it more articulately than i did then if an advertisement or contract carries a term or attractive inducement in large writing but the complete opposite \u00a0 appears in tiny writing it is my understanding of the law that that tiny writing does not supersede what appears in large writing in other words if something in an advertisement or an agreement could be said to be misleading that agreement is struck out most people however are not aware of that and would assume that if something was buried in minute writing on page 25 of a contact a company has a right to rely on that when in fact it cannot i shall give one example of why people must be made more aware of their rights and their rights of redress it returns to what the hon member for richmond park said about education i accept that it is impossible to teach 14 15 or 16yearolds the intricacies of contract law however in general terms we could do more amendment no 17 seeks to do that by putting the agreement on a legal basis whereby companies can charge if those charges were agreed to at the outset of the contract but they cannot impose charges simply because they are the much stronger party and because they can persuade people that they are entitled to do so when in fact they may not be able to do so ", " i sympathise with the spirit in which the hon member for richmond park moved the amendment but i see possible problems with the drafting i entirely agree with the point that very busy and vulnerable people may fall foul of the agreements but it can happen to those who do not fall into either category but who simply do not understand the legal technicalities of a contract that is what we are talking about people study contract law at university for many years then may take articles and study for several more they then become solicitors but even \u00a0 they sometimes do not understand the intricacies of contract law so it is a little much to expect anyone else to understand it fullythere is of course the legal philosophy of caveat emptor\u2014let the buyer beware ordinarily in a free society that is quite reasonable but when we come to very complicated contracts the relative strength of the parties is very different i have many concerns not only about the way in which agreements are set up but the way in which they are run if i interpret it correctly one of the reasons for the governments introducing the bill apart from addressing how contracts are set up\u2014i wish to turn to that important matter during the debate on amendment no 16\u2014is to deal with the way in which they are run i certainly do not want extra burdens to be placed on businesses which are by and large honourable and successful i am part of the shadow industry team and we are attempting to devise deregulation in order to make businesses more competitive there is far too much red tape in europe and in britain and we wish to get rid of much of it but we do not wish to do so to such an extent that it will create unnecessary problems it is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that people are getting themselves into terrible amounts of debt in this country we have record debt of more than \u00a31 trillion it is so large a figure i am not sure that i understand how much it is ", " the minister is about to intervene i hope that he will tell us how many zeroes there are in a trillion", " i am grateful to the minister for that very helpful intervention\u2014i did not know that figure obviously we support entirely people who buy their own houses i remind the minister that we introduced the ability to do so in many cases so i entirely support that i am glad to see that this week the prime minister is adopting our policy", " i am grateful to my hon friend for that telling intervention it is absolutely true and it is a modern phenomenon that when people take out a mortgage\u2014let us say for \u00a3100000\u2014they may get a capped rate for five years but at the end of those five years they rarely take out a mortgage for \u00a3100000 again it will be for \u00a3110000 \u00a3120000 or \u00a3130000 nevertheless the minister has a point however i do not think that the minister was suggesting that there is no problem with the level of debt in this countryi accept that incomes increase on an ongoing basis and i accept that assets may also have increased however we cannot deny that many people get themselves into debt unnecessarily and the problem is not just the amount that they borrow the right hon member for leeds west made the point that the problem is the way in which agreements are run they work on the basis of compound interest which i could never understand at school i could never work out compound interest even though i passed my maths olevel let alone remember what an isosceles triangle was it is important that we teach people more about compound interest than isosceles triangles ", " i thank the minister for attempting to explain but i still do not see clearly business lending is either protected or it is not but that is not the case here", " i am grateful to the minister for his further attempt but i am not sure of the philosophy behind the provision business lending should either \u00a0 be protected or not but that is not the case here it seems that a limited company is not protected but a company which is not limited is protected have i got that right surely business lending should be protected or it should not it concerns me that i as a sole trader can be protected but if i were to form a limited company with \u00a3100 putting up my house and risking everything on that business i suddenly would not be protected i cannot see the logical leap but the issue probably has been explored far enough", " thank you sir john i should just remind the committee that that was meant to be an intervention from the minister rather than a speech but it is not necessary for me to move the amendments we have not yet reached that positioni am not persuaded that we should not consider what i am saying simply because it is not in the 1974 act and that it would change the 1974 act the bill is about changing the 1974 act so i do not think that that is a valid reason otherwise we would never change anything in this place i do not accept that there is a huge leap from becoming a sole trader to becoming a single director or one of two or three directors of a limited company i am not persuaded that we should go down this route however the minister has said that he will look at it again i do not think that it is just about definition it is a little bit more than that it is about practicalities however the minister said that he would have look at it again and my experience of working with the minister tells me that he will look at it very seriously indeed question put and agreed to clause 4 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " i thank the minister for his detailed and very helpful response i am still a bit concerned that somebody connected to the lender could make the declaration to return to the analogy originally used it would not be acceptable for a financial services company to dispense with the requirement to give best advice that must be done by somebody other than the company and in that case it would be the person taking out the pension plan if that was what they were taking out i am not entirely satisfied but the minister has gone into considerable detail in answering my question i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendmentamendment by leave withdrawn clause 3 ordered to stand part of the bill ", " it may help if i say that these amendments are consequential on deleting clause 4", " i thank the minister for explaining why clause 2 is valuable i admit that i am slightly confused because it seems that business agreements that are worth less than \u00a325000 will continue to be regulated whereas those that are worth more than that will not i do not follow that logichaving considered the clause long and hard my main reason for wanting to strike it out is that as i understand it an incorporated company can borrow more than \u00a325000 and not be covered in many cases there is little difference between an incorporated company and an unincorporated association a partnership or an individual trader when i was in business a few years ago anyone could set up a company for around \u00a3100 often getting the protection that forming a company would give them such as limited liability however in many other cases the director of that company would have had to give a personal guarantee for many of the business transactions that were carried out the director might have had to borrow money to keep the business going would probably have had to give a directors guarantee for that loan and quite often would have had to put his house up as surety that situation is not very different from that of the man next door who might carry on in business without the protection of that limited company my point is that the protection of a limited company often does not exist the sensible clauses of the bill should therefore protect someone in that situation for example if a person were to take out credit with an unscrupulous lender or someone who fires off letters to \u00a0 him every time he misses a payment and charges him \u00a330 or \u00a340 for the privilege his business would quickly get into serious difficulties if that person has been given a directors guarantee he could find himself in exactly the same situation as an individual who has borrowed money for a world cruise i do not see a huge difference will the minister explain why those two situations are different the fact that the borrowing is for business purposes does not change the matter we are still talking about individuals and if the bill is worth passing which in general terms it is everyone should be protected by it otherwise the suggestion is that the bill is flawed before i am happy to accept the clause the minister will need to explain it in more detail and answer some of my points ", " i join the minister in welcoming you to the committee sir john i do not have his breadth of experience of serving under you on committees but i am sure that it will be a very pleasurable and enlightening experiencethe official opposition are of course opposed to programme motions and we voted against the programming of this committee because we feel that these things should be more openended important issues are before us and we cannot tell how long it will take to discuss them however we are where we are and i have no intention of prolonging this part of the proceedings ", " i beg to move amendment no 9 in clause 3 page 2 line 27 after description insert who shall not be connected through pecuniary interest to the lender ", " this is the first clause that might be considered to be in the meaty bit of the bill it deals with an exemption that relates to high net worth debtors and hirers which means that certain people who are declared to be of high net worth do not come within the scope of the bill in a sense it is difficult to understand why the clause is in the bill but there is a precedent in the insurance industry people who go to \u00a0 for example legal and general or prudential to make a purchase or to be sold a pension plan are allowed to state that that is all they want they do not have to accept the wider advice that those companies are deemed to have to providethis provision is slightly different in that people in the insurance industry who take out a pension or a savings plan are not taking out an obligation as such they are purchasing something of lasting benefit if people decide after six months or six years that they do not want a pension they can simply cease payments that is not the case with a credit agreement people who take out credit may get themselves into a difficult situation that is not as easy to get out of i am not sure that that analogy is a direct one i am slightly concerned about people being declared of high net value and therefore not coming under the terms of the bill amendment no 9 seeks to clarify the clause the bill says that someone other than the debtor has to declare himself or herself as being of high net worth the amendment attempts to make it clear who can make that declaration i say that the person making that declaration shall not be connected through pecuniary interest to the lender it is clear what i am trying to get at a lender should not be able to provide a person to declare that the borrower is of high net worth when they have a direct pecuniary interest in doing so because that would let the lender escape the terms of the bill that is a rather convoluted way of describing it but it is probably clear what i mean amendment no 10 requires that such a declaration must be signed by the debtor in the presence of an independent witness who shall not be connected through pecuniary interest to the lender and shall not be the person who has made the original statement it is a little bit complicated but i hope that the committee understands what i am driving at i do not seek to strike out the ability of somebody to be declared as being of high net worth and therefore escape the clutches of the bill i am simply trying to make it a little more certain that the lender does not manipulate the situation ", " amendment no 9 prevents someone who is connected to the lender from giving a statement in other words the lender cannot remove someone from the clutches of the bill", " one of the constant concerns expressed to me about the bill which i supported on second reading so i do not want to be too damning was that certain of its provisions are vague and that we will have to wait for further orders to come forward before we know the details does the minister have any idea about what might be deemed high worth it may be a relative term but it would help the committee if he could say something about its meaning", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions what investigations he has made into the reliability and efficiency of the post office card accounts computer system and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions how many people have been unable to collect their pensions due to breakdowns of the post office card account computer system since its introduction and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what discussions he has had with the canadian government about the culling of seal pups in the forthcoming season and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister what guidelines he issues on periods appropriate for consultation on major documents and if he will make a statement", "to ask the deputy prime minister if he will make a statement on the proposal by the south west regional assembly that up to 30000 houses should be built on green belt land between cheltenham and gloucester", "to ask the deputy prime minister what instructions he gave the south west regional assembly regarding the regional spatial strategy for the south west and if he will instruct the assembly to extend the consultation period on its proposals for gloucestershire to at least three months", "to ask the deputy prime minister what the cost has been to a each of the six local district authorities in gloucestershire in preparation of current local plans and b gloucestershire county council in the preparation of its current structure plan", "to ask the deputy prime minister what studies a the government office for the south west and b his department has commissioned into the effect upon the floodplain in gloucestershire near cheltenham and gloucester of development near the floodplain", "i congratulate the hon member for inverness east nairn and lochaber mr stewart on securing this important debate and on having the foresight to do so at a time when energy is being widely discussed there are unfortunate reasons for its being talked about\u2014the power cuts in london and the midlands a while ago those cuts were not caused by a shortage of supply but they focused peoples minds on what might happen and prompted a television programme that caused a little concernalthough the cuts were to do with infrastructure rather than supply we should take note of them the hon member for inverness east nairn and lochaber and more particularly the hon member for hamilton south mr tynan talked about the dangers and difficulties of bringing gas from as far away as russia that is of course a problem of infrastructure and if infrastructure went wrong in our own country it has the potential to go wrong again if we bring gas from across the world the hon member for hamilton south made a good and wideranging speech which covered many of the issues that i intended to raise so i shall keep my comments fairly brief to allow the minister time for his replythe hon member for selby mr grogan made some good points about gas prices he will know as well as anyone about the decline of the coal industry three mines in selby have i think closed recently he will have firsthand experience relevant to what the hon member for hamilton south was saying on the subject i regret the industrys decline my father was a miner and i have natural sympathy for the mining industry however we must recognise that there are environmental pressures on the coal industry it may be possible to deal with those to some extent through clean coal technology although that will require a great deal of financial input at a time when there is not as much investment in the energy sector as we might want\u2014something that we should be concerned aboutas coal and nuclear power decline and as renewables come along\u2014but slowly they are at slightly less than 3 per cent now\u2014we must consider where our energy supplies will come from at present nuclear energy provides about 22 or 23 per cent of our electricity needs in 20 years that will be down to only 2 per cent unless there is further investment in the nuclear industry we cannot predict exactly what the production from coal will be other than that it was 66 per cent in 1990 and it is now about 33 per cent we do not know what it will be in 20 years but even if it reduces considerably and even if renewables come along as we hope that they will somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of our energy needs will come from gas i have made a few assumptions but they are not outrageous assumptions what i have described could well come to passover the past 30 years\u2014perhaps not quite that long in terms of gas\u2014we have had a lot of reserves from the north sea they are starting to decline although there are still a lot of gas and oil reserves there we are having to look further afield for our gas supplies i do not think that that is necessarily a terrible problem i read in the financial times this morning that the minister is going to norway next month to finalise the treaty for the pipeline from that country which is welcome however it will supply only about 20 per cent of our gas needs at most there is also the interconnector with holland which will come on line in 2006\u201307 i do not know exactly how much gas will come from thatas we increase our dependency on gas we will have to go further afield to get it russia is the obvious place to go there is the theory that it needs the money and therefore it will not cut off gas supplies but tell that to belarus which had an interruption in its supply because of a political dispute i do not claim to be an expert in what is happening in yukos the giant oil company in russia but i cannot persuade myself that there is not some political manoeuvring going on i will not put it any stronger than that but i think there is enough concern about that to give me some concern about becoming overdependent on supplies from russia or any other country that does not have a stable political historythere is also concern about the infrastructure that brings the gas to our country from so far away the government are right to focus on the threat of terrorism in its many forms we cannot exclude the possibility of some terroristinspired interruption to our gas supply if it comes all the way from russia how could we get the gas here we could bring it in a liquefied form but we might be looking to bring it here by pipeline in which case we would be at the end of a very long pipelinejust over a year ago i visited finland to see its new nuclear reactor plans and the way that it deals with nuclear waste the public were persuaded to go for a fifth reactor by the finnish government saying it is up to you mr and mrs elector you have a choice we either build a fifth nuclear reactor or we depend on gas from the russians unsurprisingly they chose to have a fifth nuclear reactorit is interesting that 23 countries are building or planning to build new nuclear reactors that will increase the civil nuclear capacity of the world by 33 per cent we need to ask whether those countries are all wrong and that we are right to allow our nuclear industry to decline to just 2 per cent and to virtually nothing in 20 years with regard to security of supply we must have a balanced energy policy that has been described in previous contributions as an integrated policy i do not think there is much difference between those phrasesthe hon member for hamilton south is not the only member present who is old enough to remember the threeday week sadly i also remember it i think that the slogan at the time was vote for ted and stay in bed as i am a conservative i should not have said that but i remember all the slogans that were going around at the time in our industrialised country we had a threeday week the television was compulsorily turned off at 10 pm we sat in the dark for many nights\u2014although as i was a teenager with a girlfriend at the time i do not think that i was too perturbed by that however from an industrial point of view it was a disaster that was only 30 years ago within our living and working memory my point is that we were in that situation because of an overdependence on one source of energy we should not put ourselves in that position again in relation to coal or gas or any other single form of energy", "hon members will be glad to hear that i am moving off the previous topic however i am very sympathetic to that idea the government are in a difficult position with regard to the nuclear industry any government will be because the most likely builder of a new nuclear plant is british energy and it is in severe financial difficulties it is also constrained by the european union judgment on its aid package\u2014the minister will interrupt me if i am wrong\u2014in that it cannot run a new nuclear plant for i think six years that is a further difficulty therefore i am sympathetic to the idea of a new generation of nuclear plant not because i have a greater regard for that industry than i have for any other but because i cannot see how without a nuclear industry we are to secure supply or cut emissionsif in 20 years we replace our entire nuclear production with renewables\u2014that is a very big if\u2014we will have got nowhere with cutting carbon emissions we will have only replaced one carbonfree industry with another we will not have affected emissions if we are reducing emissions we have to have three things renewables the generation of nuclear power and a reduction in electricity use\u2014it is not a case of eitheror if the hon member for banff and buchan mr salmond is asking me whether as energy minister on 6 may i would sign a cheque for the nuclear industry the answer is that no i would not it is a matter of getting the industry together and asking what is the position how do you see the future and are there things that government can do apart from signing a cheque that might encourage you to address the imbalance of supply that will happen in the near future\u2014in our lifetime i hope that that is a reasonably clear answer to the very sensible question that the hon gentleman asked we have to move towards a balanced energy policy if we are not to be overdependent on one source of energynothing that i have said should be taken as an attack on the gas industry gas has provided a great deal of security of supply over many years it has provided a great deal of money to the exchequer and i congratulate those who operate the industry they have a bright future and they will continue to play a significant role in the supply of energy to this country however i would not want us to be dependent to the extent of say three quarters of our energy coming from gas if much of that gas were to come from countries that do not have proven records of political stabilitythe difficulty is how can a government control that i am not an interventionist politician i came into parliament to try to persuade governments of all colours to withdraw from many areas of life\u2014the government are involved in too many of those so how does one get the country to move towards the balance of energy supply that we need without being interventionist i sympathise with the minister and that is not an easy thing to do our energy market is not a free market it has many environmental constraints and a regulator and a demand on it to persuade its customers not to use as much of its product as they do i do not know whether that is a unique situation but it is very unusual we do not have a completely free market we have a situation in which the government have to keep their hand on the tiller while at the same time not interfering to the point that makes matters worseas we look to the future the government need to give an idea to the energy industries\u2014particularly to the coal industry\u2014about how they think that things will go that is not to interfere beyond where it is right for governments to interfere but so that we have some confidence about the mediumterm futurei do not think that we are facing electricity cuts this winter or next unless an absolutely terrible winter coincides with a number of breakdowns in power generation across the country events which are beyond anything that we can ordinarily control we do not have a shortterm problem however the hon members for inverness east nairn and lochaber and for hamilton south have said that the medium term does not look quite so secure i do not want to be alarmist and no one here today has been but we are right to raise the issues and say lets not wait until the last minute and then paniclet us think five or 10 years ahead where do we see electricity supplies coming from is it right that we should be burning gas to produce electricity when gas itself can be used and when there are other ways of producing electricity including renewables and nuclear as well as the government indicating what sort of future they see for nuclear and coal\u2014and therefore by implication for gas\u2014we need more of a steer on the subject of renewables the hon member for hazel grove mr stunell said that to get half of our electricity from renewables we need only to increase renewable usage by one percentage point each year that is sound mathematics and achieving it does not sound very difficult but 1 per cent of our electricity production is quite a lot in round figures it is about half what a nuclear power station would produce it is quite a challenge to bring on renewable production to that extentour partys policy is to retain the renewables obligation and the targets within it it is also our policy to examine the internal workings of that obligation to ascertain whether it is actually producing what we want and i know that the government have already set about doing that at present the obligation is not producing what we want there is an overemphasis on wind power anyone who thinks that we can solve this countrys energy problems simply with wind is living in cloud cuckoo land i am well aware of the opposition to wind power certainly in some areas of scotland we need a mixed policy and we need to know where we are going with renewables nuclear power and coal which would enable us to know where we are going with gas once again i congratulate the hon member for inverness east nairn and lochaber on initiating this important debate", "to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make a statement on the working of the regional decisionmaking process in relation to the roads programme with particular reference to the southwest", "it is a pleasure to follow the hon member for barnsley west and penistone mr clapham who made a comprehensive speech my hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans who spoke before the hon gentleman is promoting a private members bill on drugs he was lucky enough to come second in the ballot and is putting his good fortune to use in probably the best way possible given the problem that the country facesalthough i am sure that it was unintended i got the impression from the secretary of states tone that he thought that the drugs problem was being beaten but i submit that that is not the case i support the bill because it is an attempt to achieve that although i cannot demonstrate the deep knowledge of the matter that many hon members have shown i want to speak in the debate because we are not beating the drugs problemas my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden david davis said the bill is a step in the right direction but only a small one i regret to say that it is an attempt to correct the damage caused by the government\u2014perhaps inadvertently\u2014when they lowered the classification of cannabis i will make no apology for returning to that point on many occasions the house does not only pass legislation after all legislation can only do so much so we must send messages lowering the classification of cannabis got far more publicity throughout the country than the bill will receiveas i said during an intervention i recently heard that many young people think that cannabis has been legalised one or two labour members said that the police are not bothering to arrest people for cannabis crime let us add those two things together if young people think that using cannabis is legal and the police are not bothering to make arrests why should young people not take cannabis the government are giving the message that drugs are bad yet that taking the socalled recreational drug cannabis is not as bad as it used to be we cannot tackle the drugs problem seriously when we give such mixed and misleading messagesmy hon friend the member for ribble valley referred to the brixton experience a pilot study was carried out but because it did not produce the results that the government wanted the lessons drawn from it have been forgotten the government hired a drugs tsar and because he did not say the things that the government wanted to hear he was moved quickly to one side that is not the way to tackle the problem of drugsthere are good messages in the bill and although it contains some good measures that are too strong for one or two labour members to take on board or agree with such messages and measures are pointing in the right direction however the messages about drugs are rather weak when we compare them to some of the other messages that we send out from this place for example we are rightly deeply concerned about binge drinking but we seem to hear much more about the problems associated with binge drinking\u2014i accept that they are considerable\u2014than about the problems associated with drugsi return to my point that the message about drugs is not consistent and is not strong enough potentially we are turning smokers into criminals if the government are returned it seems that those who have a social drink or a social smoke are being treated like pariahs yet drug takers are having far more tolerance extended to them sympathy they need and i entirely support the calls especially those made by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green mr duncan smith for better rehabilitation but the message about the evils of drugs including the evils of cannabis and the psychological difficulties caused by cannabis must be advanced with greater strengthwe have heard arguments for the legalisation or decriminalisation whichever term we use of drugs especially from the hon member for newport west paul flynn who made a thoughtprovoking speech he demonstrated great knowledge but i disagree with the conclusions that he drew from the extensive studies that he has obviously undertaken he said that if an activity is illegal it arouses curiosity especially in the minds of the young i suppose that that is true i suppose that many young people are curious about what it is like to purchase alcohol if they are not 18 but i did not hear the hon gentleman suggesting that we should legalise the purchasing of alcohol by those who are under 18 i do not think that we can follow the logic of the hon gentlemans argument in terms of what happened during prohibition when i challenged him on whether he would ban smoking in public places he said that he would however that sends out an inconsistent messagethe hon gentleman almost suggested\u2014i am sorry that he is not in his place to hear what i am saying\u2014that the fact that it is illegal to possess and to take drugs made the committing of crime more prevalent i do not follow that logic the crime is committed to secure the money if drug taking were legal given their cost and their effects many people would continue to commit crime to fund their habit on that basis there is no logical or consistent argumentdrug taking or drug possession must be illegal if there is to be legal consistency the taking of drugs fuels crime and crime fuels the taking of drugs not only crime such as burglary or theft\u2014those are the obvious two crimes\u2014but as the hon member for barnsley west and penistone said prostitution when prostitution is fuelled by drug taking further problems ensue such as the trafficking of young girls the result is a terrible vicious circle the outcome is also higher rates of other crime in northern ireland where i happen to spend a little time and carry out studies the drugs trade is an industry in itselfi cannot follow the logic of the argument that the problems would be removed if we legalised drug taking if the crime that fuels the drugs is illegal the drugs themselves should be illegal as i pointed out in an intervention if drugs are to become acceptable we would have to decriminalise them and make them legal that process would send the wrong message are people who propose that drugs should be legalised suggesting that they should be sold alongside the mars bars in the shop of my hon friend the member for ribble valley that would not be appropriate but where would people obtain drugs if they were made legal i believe that they would probably obtain them at the same places that they obtain them now they would buy them from dealers but cannabis dealers i am afraid also deal in stronger drugs they do not just deal in what are sometimes erroneously termed soft drugs where will young people be advised to buy drugs if they are made legalpeople take drugs for different reasons some turn to crime to fund their habit but others may be considered the silent victims and are members of the working population the middle classes\u2014whatever that means these days\u2014and even higher classes i telephoned gloucestershire constabulary for advice on my speech this morning and asked how many such people take drugs they said that by definition they did not know because those people do not break other laws or steal to finance their habit people who take drugs who then commit crime are the visible drug takers who are in the public eye but worryingly there are others we do not know aboutthe bill that my hon friend the member for ribble valley has introduced is rightly concerned with drug dealers although it also calls for a full survey of the evils of cannabis i am advised that if the police take out a drug dealer and he goes to prison\u2014i am not suggesting that that should not happen\u2014another drug dealer steps into his place and continues the supply of drugs in other words the demand side is probably the bigger problem that does not mean that we should not hammer for want of a better word drug dealers but a more imaginative approach is needed to stem demand as well as supply stemming supply might reduce usage but it might increase the cost of drugs which could have a knockon effect on crime which would increase as people tried to pay for those drugs the solution to that problem is extremely difficult and i shall return to it in a momentthe law as i have said must crack down on dealers and the police are using the proceeds of crime act 2002 to do that they say that it is helpful to be able to seize the assets of people who have been sent to prison for drug dealing because the police do not believe that prison is enough drug dealers like many habitual criminals regard prison as an occupational hazard the police therefore find it useful to confiscate assets so that when those people come out of prison they cannot easily return to their evil trade on the other hand the police say that reducing those people to nothing may mean that when they leave prison they are tempted to return to crime to get started in the drugs trade again i do not know the answer to that problem\u2014i am simply trying to highlight itthe supply of drugs is highly organised and suppliers deal in all kinds of drugs indeed they deal in the drugs that they can get at that particular time in order to sell on if they can get a shipload of one kind of drug at a decent price they will buy that drug and move it on as i said earlier people who supply cannabis also supply many other drugssome aspects of the bill are contentious testing on arrest does not seem much different from breathalysing somebody who is suspected of drink driving if that helps the process i do not see it as a problem another issue is the reasonable test when someone is caught in possession to determine whether that person is a dealer not just someone who takes drugs reasonable is probably the most important word in the english legal system but it presents problems what do we mean by reasonable is there any such thing as possessing a reasonable amount of drugs i am not sure how the courts will determine that the committee may want to try to clarify the matterthe supplying of drugs must be tackled as must the demand more joinedup thinking is needed before 1997 we heard how the labour party would introduce joinedup government we are still waiting for that and nowhere more than in drugs policy there must be a stronger link between education health and the criminal process we should not be afraid to teach young people about the evils of drugs the damage they cause the fact that they can be carcinogenic and addictive and about how starting on cannabis often leads on to class a drugs we should say that much more clearly than we do", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that friendly intervention no i cannot say that drinking milk leads one on to whisky but i am advised by many police officers that most heroin addicts started on cannabis i am not an expert on the subject as i said at the beginning of my speech so i am persuaded by the views of the many police officers to whom i have spoken who work at the sharp end of the businesswe must teach young people about the evils of drugs in terms of their cost and the health effects and we must stress how stupid it is to take drugs we cannot do that while reducing the classification of the socalled recreational drug i have frontbench responsibilities on other days for the consumer credit bill i said on second reading of that bill that legislation cannot cure all the ills and i accept that that applies to this bill as well much depends on educationwe have a difficult situation in this country and probably throughout the socalled developed world where attitudes do not help to combat drugs we hear a great deal about civil liberties and i agree with the secretary of state when he says that one mans civil liberties are another mans ruined life i paraphrase but that was his general message we must work on the basis that we believe in the freedom of the individual under the rule of law when it comes to drugs we need such law", "i hope this will be an easier intervention than the last one", "the hon gentleman puts it far better than i could have put it and far better than the secretary of state put it too which is not surprising he has been in the house an awful lot longer than i have but i have been here long enough to know not to take him on in combat i will not go further down that routei want to reemphasise my main points we need a stronger law and i will therefore support the bill which moves us in that direction we need the right messages to be sent from parliament about drugs and we need better rehabilitation treatment and as in so many other walks of life better educationi want to conclude on the point with which i started the drugs problem is not beaten and i am not yet persuaded that at the moment we are beating it", "i am following the hon gentlemans argument about the connection between prohibition and usage by way of analogy would he support a ban on smoking in public places particularly pubs and restaurants", "drugs are illegal in this country and they would have to be legalised if we were to end up where the hon gentleman wants us to end up legalisation would surely send out a message we should learn the lesson from lowering the classification of cannabis which sent out a message that confused young people many of whom thought that cannabis had been legalised this place is not only about passing laws but about sending messages", "if the secretary of state visits gloucester royal hospital will he also visit cheltenham hospital which is facing the closure of the childrens ward in terms of 24hour clinical care i do not rise to make a political point but i think that it is worth mentioning that closure in view of the previous question the primary care trust is pushing the transfer of the ward to gloucester on a clinical basis and recently there have been clinical questions raised about that transfer i do not expect an immediate answer from the secretary of state but will he look into that matter will he satisfy himself that it would be in the wider interests of all the children in gloucestershire for that move to take place and will he endeavour to write to me about it", "to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport if she will make a statement on the public funding of the waterways museums at a gloucester docks b stoke bruerne and c ellesmere port", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills what rights parents have to withdraw their children from religious education lessons in state schools and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry what discussions she has had with the board of british energy on bonuses likely to be paid to executives over the next six months and if she will make a statement", "it is a pleasure to wind up the debate for the official opposition it has been a good natured and well informed debate and i shall deal in a moment with some of the contributionsi too regret the absence of the secretary of state but i pay tribute to the minister for the way he has put his case and drawn up the bill i thank him for his courtesy in inviting me to his office a few weeks ago to discuss the bill perhaps i am not supposed to say that i am sorry but i appreciated the invitation that does not mean that we will agree on everything but when we do not oppose the bill working behind the scenes like that is beneficial to those whom we are trying to helpwe heard from all parts of the house about indebtedness we heard that debt has increased considerably in the past few years we also heard that incomes and household assets have increased\u2014that is true but it misses the point in individual cases there can still be a problem and in some cases a desperate problem to say that income or assets have increased in general is to ignore the deeper point i am pleased that the deeper point has not been ignored by many hon members who spoke today they recognised that debt can be a huge problemi remember my grandfather telling me if youre in debt youre in danger that is true and it is a maxim that i have tried to stick to all my life there are times when it may be desirable to borrow money if one wants luxury items that may be the right way to acquire them although personally i think it is not it may be useful to borrow money or extend ones credit to get over difficult times the problem is that when one is in difficulty one is more vulnerable and when one is vulnerable one is less likely to strike a good deal we should be aware of thatsome people do borrow sensibly but when i nipped out earlier for five minutes for a cup of tea i had a message on my pager somebody who came to see me yesterday\u2014a constituency case\u2014needed a little money the message was to let me know that they had gone into their bank today without much supporting evidence and had come out with a promise of \u00a324000 just like that that i regret to say is not untypical it happens all the time and it proves to be a difficulty for some people i know from experience that when people go out to work on monday morning and get their pay packet on friday or at the end of the month it is depressing to see a large chunk of that money go to pay off past debts perhaps for consumer goods from which the shine the polish and the attraction have worn off we are right to tackle the issueone of the problems is that legislation cannot tackle all the issues we live in a free country where rightly people can borrow money if they so desire nothing that i have said so far should be taken as an attack on the credit industry which is extremely efficient and one of our leading industries there is a case for better education on running finances and the composition of credit agreements from studies that i have conducted for example i know that if a contract includes a big condition in large print minute writing somewhere else on the contract might not be legal and might not reverse what the big writing says i know that but a lot of people probably do not and they may fall foul of such contracts that is one small example of how we might start to educate people better when we are broadening the curriculum in schools such matters could be added to citizenship classes whenever i go to a wedding or speak to couples who are about to get married\u2014they do not come and seek my advice\u2014my advice to them is the same as that given to me do not overstretch yourselves and do not get into too much debti shall move on to hon members contributions the right hon member for dumbarton mr mcfall the chairman of the treasury committee discussed loan sharks and interest calculations and warned about debtthe liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for gordon malcolm bruce spoke at great length about many issues\u2014i shall not try to touch on all of them but his speech was comprehensivethe hon member for burnley mr pike spoke about people being ripped off by loan sharks and cited one or two moving casesmy hon friend the member for upminster angela watkinson made a characteristically good oldfashioned speech containing many good oldfashioned values\u2014that is a compliment she also provided warnings about debt and i echo her remarksthe right hon member for leeds west mr battle discussed interest rate charges i have not been persuaded yet and want to return to this point but his argument for a statutory instrument to allow the minister whoever that may be\u2014an election may well be coming up\u2014to impose a ceiling on interest rates was persuasive interruption i might be that minister labour members seemed to give up on the minister and started to ask conservative members questions about what we would do which is sensible because they will be doing that an awful lot more after 6 maymy hon friend the member for bexhill and battle gregory barker discussed the savings ratio and increased household debt he provoked a number of interventions but he made a thoughtful speech especially when he said that he wanted a more favourable balance in the industry which is a good way to put itthe hon and learned member for dudley north ross cranston made a good point to which i shall return when he asked about the meaning of unfairmy hon friend the member for southwest bedfordshire andrew selous made an outstanding speech especially when he mentioned that financial problems are a considerable factor in many marriage breakdowns although financial problems are not the only reason for marriage breakdowns debts place many marriages under an unreasonable strain and i am glad that he raised that point he raised another important issue the inadequacy of credit ratings and discussed payment protection which he described as a scamunfortunately i missed the speech by the hon member for edinburgh north and leith mr lazarowicz but i am told that he raised the issue of unfairness i apologise for missing his speech and that of the hon member for angus mr weir who made the good point that aprs are not a reliable guide to actual interest ratesin the shortest speech that i have ever heard him make the hon member for ochil mr oneill made the good point that statutory instruments are perhaps neededthe hon member for bassetlaw john mann discussed banks and their practices the hon member for warwick and leamington mr plaskitt spoke about credit card cheques and the hon member for caerphilly mr david from whom we have just heard discussed the difficulties with many money lenders it has been a very wideranging debatei mentioned my concerns about debt levels education and small print like many other hon members i am also somewhat concerned about the way in which opportunities to borrow money are marketed and soldit is right to reduce the burden of proof to unfairness but we need to know what that means otherwise one or two court judgments might be required in order to set a precedent i am not convinced that we should leave the provision as it is and before the committee starts i shall discuss with my hon friends whether we want to try to clarify it after all clarification is one of the governments main motivations for introducing the billon small loans one of the arguments against interest rate ceilings is that the interest rate is not necessarily the allimportant factor many people find small loans of \u00a3100 or \u00a3200 very helpful the interest rate on those loans might be relatively high but the companies who lend that kind of money are often more flexible in their approach so one factor may balance the other we will need to take a sensitive approach to that in committee i would not want such customers to be alarmed for example by getting late payment notices when they are only two or three weeks late with the payment and paying only a fiver a weeki am worried about giving more power to the office of fair trading the bill is all about proper regulation and cutting out the loan sharks\u2014that is necessary and i would not want anyone to get me wrong about that however i remember that when i had an adjournment debate on the horseracing industry in the house about 18 months ago\u2014it was replied to by the minister who will reply today\u2014i said that although parliament can control the oft through primary legislation it has no such control on a daytoday basis i could bring my case to the house of commons but it would not be heard by the oft which had the power to destroy the horseracing industry there was nothing that i as a member of parliament with the cheltenham racecourse in my area could do about it that is an analogy but it is relevant i am particularly worried for example about giving the oft the power to enter premises i shall return to that in committeeseveral hon members said that there should be more scope for statutory instruments in the bill\u2014for example to allow the minister if he so wishes to set interest rate ceilings or to increase the \u00a350000 fine if it is found to be inadequate at the moment i am not persuaded that we should go down that route although i understand the points that have been made again i will discuss it with my hon friendswe will need to analyse many of these matters in committee and i regret that we may not have adequate time to do so i am afraid that it is the hallmark of this government to programme everything that is why in a few minutes we will vote against the programme motion although we will not vote against the bill itselfwe recognise the need for the bill the credit industry and the financial world in general have changed remarkably and are unrecognisable from what they were 30 years ago we need to root out loan sharks and to create more favourable conditions for those who borrow money especially the vulnerable the same people lose out all the time and the bill is welcome if it will prevent those same people from losing out in future i thank the minister for his courtesy in keeping me informed as he introduced the bill and i look forward to taking up the issues with him in committee", "if she will make a statement on the level of farmgate milk prices", "i am grateful to the minister for that response but over the last 10 years farmers have seen their share of the retail price of milk fall from 60 per cent to 40 per cent that perhaps explains why two of the largest dairy farmers in my constituency have given up producing milk and i suspect that more will follow suit a short while ago the secretary of state said that it would be regrettable to introduce a fuel transport obligation because that would suck in imports but if farmers are going to go out of business that is surely what is going to happen with milk when i meet my farmers in the near future what can i say to them given the current dire position what hope can i give them for the future", "if he will make a statement on his planned regionalisation of fire and rescue control rooms", "is the minister aware of the enormous opposition to that scheme across the country from councils local people and the fire service itself why does he feel that all those people are wrong and that he is right will he take into account the circumstances in gloucestershire where the fire and rescue service emergency room has recently moved into a new tristar centre his proposal is not only expensive but wrong", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry when she expects to make a decision on the application

important debate i congratulate the hon member for south derbyshire mr todd on having introduced it i seem to remember a similar debate in this chamber a few months ago which i think was initiated by the hon member for barnsley west and penistone mr clapham that another debate is taking place shows how important people feel the issue is and that there are one or two problems with the schemes administrationin considering how the scheme was set up i have to agree with the hon member for gordon malcolm bruce that it is complicated i suppose that it was inevitable that it would be so given the number of claimants and the difficulties in assessing health and therefore what compensation people are due given as we have heard that many people have received payouts we could say that the scheme is working reasonably well considering its complexities however i am concerned and not only as a result of my own research i was also concerned to hear the hon member for barnsley east and mexborough jeff ennis say that although a number of his constituents had been well compensated quite a few had received a derisory amount some \u00a3200 when the claims handlers would be receiving something like \u00a32200 when that is the case we have to ask the minister again whether nothing can be done to make the system fairerwe have heard in the past that solicitors have double claimed from the information that i have i believe that not many have and i know that the minister has written to solicitors who have been accused of double claiming and has reported those who have not replied to the law society however according to information that i have managed to find of 173 complaints received by the society 63 have been concluded but repayments have been made in only 23 cases so there is still some way to go as i said only a relatively small number of solicitors have double claimed but to prove the benefit of the compensation scheme it is important to bring justice to them and indeed to the people who should have been compensatedit needs to be said that some solicitors have done quite well out of the scheme i think that the most profitable group of solicitors has received almost \u00a350 million when one considers that it has dealt with a great many cases one can say well perhaps that is fair enough however we should remember that many of these cases will be much the same if not all the same so perhaps we should look at what is really happeningclaims for deceased miners were mentioned i suppose that they are the saddest of cases and will be the most complicated but the minister would do himself justice if he went into detail in describing not only that scheme but any changes proposed to it there seems to be doubt about what changes are proposedfinally will the minister update the parliamentary answers that he has given by letting us know when he expects all claims to be settled in other words what is the completion date for compensation payments due to people who in the past let us face it kept this country going i recognise right now that there have been disputes between mining unions and conservative governments however as someone who grew up in mining areas literally next door to a coalfield and whose father was a miner\u2014he told me one christmas that i got present only because he had had an accident

here to respond to the debate and i am grateful to my hon friends the members for cotswold mr cliftonbrown and for witney mr cameron for being here to support me in the debatei have raised this matter many times in the house but i make no apology for returning to it because the school faces closure alderman knight is a special school accommodating in the main children with moderate learning difficulties but also those with severe learning difficulties behavioural difficulties and physical handicaps gloucestershire county councils cabinet has voted to close the school there has been a bit of a kickback from the countys education scrutiny committee but the cabinet and the liberal democrat and labourcontrolled council are determined to close the school their policy is to include all children with moderate learning difficulties at least in mainstream schools i shall return to that point shortlywhenever i have taken this matter up with ministers\u2014i also served on a standing committee considering a relevant bill\u2014i have been told that the legislation should not be seen as a green light for the wholesale closure of special schools however in gloucestershire we have seen that programme being put into motion bownham park the special school at stroud has closed i want to return to that matter too if the governments policy is that their legislation should not lead to the wholesale closure of special schools they really need to have a word with their friends on gloucestershire county council who are not interpreting it in that waythere are many reasons to keep special schools open the prime ministers wife alluded to those reasons on 23 june when she said to me that inclusion can be a very good idea but we also need special schools i am sure that she will not mind my quoting her i would be the first to say that many pupils with special needs can be integrated into mainstream schools\u2014many already are and very successfully too\u2014but that is not suitable for all children with special needs for some integration now can mean exclusion in later lifeif we take what may seem an extreme example although i do not think that it really is and look at the prison population we find that the majority of prisoners are illiteratethere is a link between poor education or the inability to learn and going wrong in later lifemainstream schools will not be able to cope with a massive influx of pupils with special needs the pupils at mainstream schools will be adversely affected by too many pupils with special needs going into those schools again i make no apology for saying that it is common sense the children themselves could not cope with being in mainstream schools that is my opinion it is also the opinion of many other politicians teachers chairmen of governors governors and parents more importantly it is the opinion of the childreni shall read out three letters that i received from children who go to alderman knight school ben waters writesi was at alderman knight school for seven years and i used to be very worried about lessons because i was bullied but when i came to alderman knight school in 1997 i was very nervous but over the years i became more confident if i was at mainstream i wouldnt of taken five gcses or i dont think id pass them i had a d in english d in food tech e in art e in science and a g in maths a lot of those lessons i thought i couldnt do but now i canthere is also a letter from harriet windsorclive who writesalderman knight is my favourite school it helps me learn and i have good friendsi am sad for the younger ones because they will not have a lot more help i feel very very sad about my school closing and having to go to another schooljake rose who is 11 years old met the prime ministers wife jake is autistic he writesi am happy at my school my teachers help me to learn in a way i can understand i feel safe at my schoolthat is very important a number of those children have been down to the house of commons today to make their protestthe education portfolioholder at gloucestershire county council says that children who are attending a special school now will be able to continue to go to a special school even if it is not that special school but if all the special schools are closed how will that be possible what about the officers what are they saying they say that their policy is to include children with special needs in mainstream schools so we do not know what gloucestershire county council is trying to achieve other than the closure of special schools the council does not seem to know which way it is goingi refer to the flawed process that the county council has undertaken it has held various consultations with the public closure was not mentioned in the final consultation it was indeed mentioned in an earlier consultation but the option was rejected by those who were consulted so unsurprisingly it was removed from the final consultation however the council decided that it wanted to go ahead with closure anyway what on earth was the point of the consultations how much did they cost the taxpayer of gloucestershire could not that money have been better spent at say alderman knight schoolwhen my hon friend the member for cotswold and i attended a meeting with the county council leaders on 2 july we were given a briefing paper my hon friend will remember it well on that briefing paper there is no mention of the option of closing the school what on earth is the county council doing the right hand does not know what the left hand is doingthe council predetermined the policy before it went out to consultation i understand that there are rules regarding councillors who are not allowed to attend meetings if they have a prejudged view\u2014if they have already made up their minds that is in the code of conduct for councillors yet the county council can have a prejudged view to the extent that it can reject the consultation results if it does not like them it has clearly said that it does not accept keeping the school open because that is contrary to the councils policy i have that in writing if that is not prejudging the issue i do not know what is", "i am grateful to my hon friend for that intervention i know that he takes a deep interest in these matters i entirely agree that the government should examine what is going on up and down the country because the wrong things are being done in the wrong waygloucestershire county council has consulted on merging schools without the prior consent of those schools and it has failed to consult the children the level of statementing in gloucestershire is very low the council has a duty to provide the education specified in a statement so it is no wonder that it avoids statementing in the first place", "i am grateful to my hon friend who makes a powerful point it is not only people in my constituency and those with special needs who will suffer but those who already attend mainstream schools who will suffer because of the influx\u2014that is not an insult to the children it is a factthe council has undertaken a flawed process i want to make a serious point because i understand that the director of education who has given councillors recommendations to close the school may have been in breach of the county councils own guidance she may have a nonfinancial interest which she has not declared at various meetings and she has not sought to distance herself from involvement in the matter both of those points are recommendations from the county council that she serves and i ask the minister to look into the matter if required i can provide more details that i choose not to make publici also want to draw attention to the behaviour of the leader of the county council councillor peter clarke in 1999 he assured me in front of a number of people that there was no intention to close special schools but we have seen the value of that promise on 9 august he wrote to the chairman of governors at alderman knight school he said that the chairman had expressed extreme views but that is not true he also said that a letter from the chairman which was published in a local newspaper could be construed as agreeing to extreme measures and possibly incitement that is not true\u2014i have the letter that the chairman of governors wrote and to which councillor clarke referredcouncillor clarke went on to say that he was taking the precaution of copying the letters to the countys legal officers the chief constable and the editor of the citizen who allowed that threat to be published there was no threat what we have here is a man running scared and using legal offices paid for by the taxpayer to threaten and bully such behaviour is unacceptablei referred earlier to the education scrutiny committee having kicked back the closure decision to the county councillor clarke attended that meeting as an observer on leaving the meeting a number of people heard him say we are now going to rip apart the head teacher at alderman knight school in publici believe that councillor clarke who is a labour councillor has a lot to answer for and i ask the minister to look into thatfor all those reasons we are considering whether if the closure goes through there are grounds for a judicial review because the process has been flawed there are also attempts to try to prevent some of our councillors from participating in debates and voting by saying that because they have a prejudged view they are not allowed to do so yet the county council is apparently allowed to have a prejudged viewi have raised these issues before and i am aware of the response that i am likely to get from the minister\u2014although he may surprise me he will say that it is due to local decision making however he will know that if the county council does decide on closure and the schools organisation committee is not unanimous the decision goes to the adjudicator when bownham park at stroud was closed that decision did indeed go to the adjudicator but he lived in darlington which is 2251 miles away from stroud according to multimap\u2014i looked it up today can the minister explain how that is local decision making and local democracy in actiona referendum is about to be held by tewkesbury borough council\u2014the government have put that legislation in place\u2014and we are going to raise a fighting fund to fight that referendum i pay tribute to the chairman of governors dave waters the head ieuan walsh and his staff councillors gordon shurmer and brian calway and the parents and pupils who have fought so hard to save the school i assure the minister and the county council that i will do everything in my power to save the school by legal and campaigning means these children have very special needs one can imagine the outcry if a conservative administration tried to close such a school", "to ask the

been as good as his word they are important amendments that allow the house sight of the financial plan and the ndas strategy given the amount of money to be allocated to and deployed by the nda and

concerned that the matter has not yet been raised with the leader of the house will the minister confirm that in line with the new clause it is the governments intention to have the report debated in government time every year is that the intention of this particular minister", "as the minister says this group of new clauses is a response to pressure put on the government in another place over the introduction of a renewable transport fuel obligation it is also a response to the requirements of the eu biofuels directive which requires the government to demonstrate how they will increase the use of biofuelsgiven that requirement it is a little surprising that the governments new clause only gives the secretary of state the power to introduce an obligation it does not require the secretary of state to introduce that obligation it would be interesting to have on record the governments plans in this respect how do they intend to fulfil the requirements of the directive will they indeed introduce the obligationas with the process of generating electricity there is a need to cut carbon emissions from transport which are significantly high as well as to move towards a position of security of supply of fuel for transport as we have already discussed we remember the problems that an overdependence on oil brought to this country and othersthe use of sustainable primary sources of fuel might have the added benefit of assisting our farmers at a very difficult time for them as my hon friend the member for southwest hertfordshire mr page suggested we must ensure that any potential benefit that could come to farmers actually reaches them and does not merely benefit companies that might be commissioned to bring in such crops from abroad that is an important point i am sure it is not beyond the scope of joinedup government to bring it aboutone of the questions arising from the introduction of such an obligation is how it should be approached i note that concerns are being expressed\u2014for example by the united kingdom petroleum industry association to which i spoke this morning it complains ofthe complete absence of consultationduring preparation of the amendmentsand hence any consideration by those most affected by themthat is of concern especially given that as the minister said these new clauses set out various aspects of the obligation in some detail it is unfortunate that the discussions with the industry did not take place before new clause 7 was introduced as my hon friend the member for southwest hertfordshire noted it is a shame that the new clause was not tabled in standing committee when there would have been more time for discussion we are rushing the proposal through the chamber this afternoon and there is only one hour left to debate many other important matters it would have been useful if this new clause had been introduced in committee after discussions with the industry had taken placei hope therefore that the government will consult with the industry before filling in the finer details of the obligation industry representatives have raised questions about how much the administrator will cost who will pay for him and monitor him who is a supplier and on whom the obligation will be placed they want to know at what point the amount of biofuel will be measured and how quality can be assured and they also need to be informed about the details of penalties and about who will get the certificates the government may feel that they have covered those issues but the industry representatives who raised the matter with me this morning and previously are not satisfiedthat said we support in general terms the concept of a renewable transport fuel obligation and look forward to seeing how and when it will be implemented", "may i read out part of a letter from my right hon and learned friend the leader of the opposition in reply to a constituent about energy policy for the future he saysi can assure you that nuclear energy will be a vital part of thisthat is pretty clear", "i thank the minister for the generous and courteous way in which he has dealt with the new clause he has certainly involved me at every stage for which i am grateful to him we have got to a position that is acceptable to hon members in all parts of the house and that is very sensiblei wish to go back a little bit in time and explain what the lords\u2014certainly the conservative lords\u2014were thinking about when they proposed the original provision which placed a duty or even burden on the secretary of state in respect of the integrity and security of gas and electricity supplies of course that provision came on the back of power cuts in california new york italy and more relevantly london and the west midlands those problems arose for different reasons that were not necessarily related to the actual generation of electricity but following those incidents the bbc programme if    the lights go out was broadcast on that day which was particularly cold the national grid and transco issued a warning of insufficient margin as the margin fell to about 7 per cent that is not necessarily a dangerously low position but put together all those factors had an effect and inspired those in another place to table an amendment to the bill that placed responsibility for securing energy supply with the secretary of statethe issue also went wider we now face a situation in which our indigenous gas and oil supplies are starting to decline i shall not put it any stronger than that there are a lot of environmental pressures on the coal industry from the large combustion plant directive and the emissions trading scheme rightly we have our own targets for reducing emissions over the next 20 years unless extensions and new build are embarked upon the nuclear industry will decline from its present 22 per cent of electricity generation to just 2 per cent we all support renewables in terms of the practical challenge of building them and bringing them online as well as in a philosophical sense but there is a long way to go to make up the potential loss of the nuclear and coal generating industriesthe point that i am making in a roundabout way is that there is a question mark over the security of supply and our ability to generate sufficient electricity in the medium term the medium term could be two three four or five years or slightly longer\u2014it is a moveable feast\u2014but however we define it the problem remains it is not only conservative members who put forward that proposition\u2014as the minister and liberal democrat members know many industry commentators share our concern they are worried that falling wholesale prices will make many investors nervous about investing in the generating business given that they have to make money and can choose to invest anywherethat was the general background to the drawing up of the amendment that the lords originally added to the bill the minister is right to say that that was perhaps misinterpreted by the industry people came to us and said you were the party which freed up the electricity industry in the first place\u2014why are you supporting a clause that could reverse that of course it would not have had that effect because it gave the secretary of state no more power than he\u2014or she in this case\u2014already had there was alarm however and the last thing that we wanted to do was to create any more uncertainty in the market i readily agreed to discuss it with the minister and we have reached a sensible compromise whereby the government will produce an annual report on the position with regard to gas and electricity over the short to medium termi entirely accept the ministers explanation as to why the report will not deal with oil because that situation differs in many respects however it is serious and needs addressing we all remember the difficulties in the early 1970s following the huge hike in oil prices and we have all endured the recent scare over the security of oil supplies not to mention price but i digress slightlythe minister said that the report could provide the opportunity for a debate in the house that is important because i would not like the report to be hardly seen heard about or debated people like me can come to the dispatch box and ask for a debate but if the government are not willing to provide the time it will not happen will the minister confirm that he intends the report to be debated in parliament every year if he can give that assurance in clear unequivocal terms i see no reason why we should not support the new clause", "as i acknowledged earlier the minister makes a good point when he suggests that the new clauses are somewhat less than perfect but will he make some proposals about how we can encourage the chp industry although it is not carbonfree it is certainly more efficient than many other traditional forms of electricity generation", "it is a pleasure to follow the minister in speaking to the amendmentsthe bill was greatly improved by members of the other place and was the subject of interesting debate in committee it started off as a necessary and functional bill when the government introduced it into another place but their lordships greatly improved it by introducing a number of measures that went beyond the original content one of those measures was a clause relating to microgenerationit would indeed be a useful step forward if every household in britain could generate electricity as well as use it particularly if they could do so from renewable sources such electricity could be used as it was generated or sent to the grid for use by business at that time the household could perhaps draw other electricity later in the day when it needed to do soobtaining maximum benefit from such an arrangement would probably require a change in building regulations although their lordships amendment did not go so far as to make such a suggestion it was very useful in that it sought to require the government to produce a strategy on microgeneration\u2014a strategy that could perhaps include an intention to amend building regulations to require all new houses to be fitted with solar panels for exampletheir lordships amendment also included a requirement for the government actually to set targets for microgeneration i understand that the government have varied the amendment slightly and are saying that specific targets for microgeneration would cut unhelpfully across other commitments in the energy white paper relating to renewables and combined heat and power that is their reason for attempting to change the original lords amendment i think that that is a little unfortunate because i do not see how that could happen in many ways those strategies are very different however we are where we are and given that new clause 4 is the only one available for the house to consider today we will support iti should like to spend a little time speaking to new clauses 20 and 21 however which were tabled in my name and those of my hon friends new clause 20 attempts to put back into the bill another amendment that was made in another place introducing a clause that attempts to increase the use of combined heat and power\u2014a process that is more efficient than other forms of generation because it uses the surplus heat that is used for generation in the first placein respect of a number of combined heat and power proposals planning permission has been obtained but nothing has yet been built and a number of chp plants are running at below capacity i understand that is the case because there is a lack of confidence and investment in generation at the moment which is a general problem that must be addressed however given that we all want to cut emissions and that it is recognised certainly by the opposition that there may be a problem with security of supply in the medium term due to that lack of investment a greater contribution from chp would be very good news indeed the government must have recognised that that was the case when they set the chp target of 10 gw by 2010 but the industry is apparently on course to realise between only 7 and 8 gw by that date unless something is done to help it along that is what new clause 20 is all aboutmy discussions with the combined heat and power association have led me to believe that excluding chp from the renewables obligation calculation would in fact provide sufficient encouragement to the industry enabling it to have a more realistic chance of reaching the governments own targets in committee however the government had the original clause removed basically because they claimed that removing chp from the renewables obligation calculation would have an adverse impact on the use of renewables the chpa disputes that fact new clause 21 would give the secretary of state the power to amend the renewables obligation target if necessary based on the previous years or the present years chp production to counter any possible adverse effects on renewables that is complicated but i am sure that the house is with mei accept that that arrangement could cause a seesawing of production from each source but that is unlikely once the investment in each has been made it would move us along towards cutting our emissions again in the way that the government say that they want to do otherwise we may have a problem in meeting the emissions targets by making the cuts in emissions that we all want renewables which we all support are struggling along and most commentators feel that the 2010 and 2015 targets are challenging to say the least over the next 20 years the nuclear industry will be reduced to providing just 2 per cent of our electricity generation from its present output of 22 per cent unless there are extensions or new build even if renewables entirely replaced nuclear\u2014and there has to be a big question mark over that\u2014we would have gone absolutely nowhere on cutting carbon emissions because as the minister acknowledged nuclear emits no carbon that point is frequently made by my hon friend the member for salisbury mr keycombined heat and power can make a contribution in that situation however the government seem to be saying carbon emissions bad no carbon emissions good that is true but surely lower carbon emissions as with chp represent a move in the right direction it is wrong to say that because it is not a zerocarbon process it should not be encouraged because if it emits less carbon it is better than those methods which produce much carboni am disappointed that the government chose to strike out the help and encouragement that we are trying to give to the chp industry if they believe that our amendments were and are imperfect i regret that they did not and have not proposed their own nor have they proposed any form of assistance to the chp industry that will be a great disappointment to iti should like to give encouragement to the labour members who in committee proposed the amendment on clause 81 which deals with the principal objective to promote renewable energy i have no intention of stealing their thunder by speaking against government amendment no 1 which seeks to undo all their good work but i assure them that if they oppose that amendment and force a vote they will find us in the same lobby interruption i remind labour members that we won that vote in committee so there is all to play foron the new clauses relating to the renewables obligation we support moves to strengthen the security of the obligation in terms of moneys paid in or due to be paid in and we recognise the governments attempts to achieve that through new clauses 13 and 14 although like liberal democrat members we have one or two concerns we recognise the need to improve that obligation and accept that the government are doing their best to move in the right direction in that respecti do not intend to say much about new clauses 2 and 3 which deal with energy efficiency indeed i should like to draw attention to the fact almost as a point of order mr deputy speaker that this morning we were informed that my hon friend the member for vale of york miss mcintosh would be able to move those new clauses but it subsequently turned out that that advice was incorrect i regret that because she would have spoken with far more eloquence and knowledge than i could possibly muster", "i was advised only this morning mr deputy speaker that two members could speak from the front bench on this particular group of amendments\u2014probably because it comprises such a broad range of amendments and new clauses that advice turned out to be wrong but i will not detain the house any further on the matterif my hon friend had spoken her main point would have been that we are puzzled as to why a government who love setting targets have removed their very targets relating to household energy efficiency will the minister explain that aboutturnwe support the clause requiring the government to produce and implement a microgeneration strategy although we regret the slight weakening of its original proposal will the minister explain why the government are opposed to the amendments relating to combined heat and power if he intends to say that the amendments are imperfect what strategy will the government develop to help the chp industry to contribute to the clean and efficient generation of electricity and how they will move that industry forward to give it the confidence that its representatives say that it needs", "to ask the secretary of state for transport 1  if he will make a statement on the employment trends of british seafarers over the last seven years2  what effect the tonnage tax scheme has had on employment levels among british seafarers and if he will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for the

obrien and your fellow chairmen mr sayeed and mr gale for your expert guidance and good humour and mr lee the clerk and his staff for their help i should also like to thank my hon friends the members for vale of york for southwest hertfordshire for salisbury mr key and for bury st edmunds mr ruffley for their guidance and good humour and for the hard work that they have put into the bill much of which is complicated i am grateful to them i also pay tribute to liberal democrat members who have contributed greatly as has the hon member for angus mr weir who has all alone provided us with a great deal of worthwhile information  may i also pay tribute to the labour rebels who have made the committee very interesting i look forward to hearing their contributions at later stages i am sure that they will not lose their voices and will continue to promote the beliefs that they hold so sincerely i thank the parliamentary undersecretary of state for trade and industry who has dealt with some of the bill i think that he would acknowledge that the minister for energy ecommerce and postal services has probably handled the greater part of it which is only right given his brief and i should like to pay tribute to him in his absence he showed his customary degree of courtesy and friendliness and was a pleasure to work with i thank him as well ", " obsessed", " on a point of order mr obrien is this really relevant to what we are discussing", " i welcome you back to the committee mr obrien i shall be brief because as ever my hon friend the member for vale of york made a comprehensive speech and advanced many reasons to resist the governments amendments the fact that the clause is a diversion from the free market\u2014i am not criticising it for that reason\u2014through the adjustment of transmission charges means that there should be a report about the charges and costs of the scheme that is not unreasonable there is a requirement on many authorities including local and police authorities to produce reports and strategies one wonders how they deliver services when they have so many reports and strategies to produce given the enormous number of civil servants amassed by the government i am sure that they can publish a report on the matter the adjustment of transmission charges is an important issue it is not asking too much for a report to be produced therefore i am persuaded to vote against the amendment and shall ask my hon friends to do the same unless the minister comes up with a more convincing argument in his windingup remarks than he did in his opening remarks ", " i am still not entirely clear what the difference between british energy and these companies would be and i am not entirely satisfied that the minister has explained the difference although it is an analogy at this stage i cannot see why the european commission would view each company differently surely the government or the courts would grant an energy administration order if a company could not run itself financially i do not see the difference between company a not being able to run itself financially and company b not being able to run itself financially it seems to provide much the same reason for taking that company over i wonder whether these clauses are compatible with european law and it seems that the government are saying that they do not know either are we not are in a bit of a mess", " what i want to say follows on from the questions put by my hon friend the member for vale of york miss mcintosh this strange clause states that the secretary of state may guarantee various sums that are borrowed by the company when the energy administration order is in force it seems odd that even after the government have effectively taken over the company it can continue to borrow sums which the government can guarantee what is the position under european law in that respect will the minister please clarify the effect of the clause", " i accept the good intentions of the clause but the timing is difficult in the sense that the ruling on british energy has not yet been made however if the ruling went against the governments intentions in respect of british energy would that mean by implication that the clause is worthless is that really the position", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and

taking over a company\u2014that it cannot pay its debts that it is likely not to be able to pay its debts or thatit would be just and equitable    to wind up the company in the public interest the latter is a wideranging provision will the minister explain how that fits with the other provisions of the clause which is about companies going into liquidation or administration  the minister for energy ecommerce and postal services mr stephen timms i am pleased that you are chairing our deliberations this afternoon mr gale the clause sets out the powers of the court when hearing an application for an energy administration order an application may be made by the secretary of state or with her consent by ofgem the court may make the order only if it is satisfied that one of three situations applies each of which is taken from existing insolvency law first the company must be unable to pay its debts secondly it is likely to be unable to do so\u2014that is it is facing insolvency thirdly on the point raised by the hon gentleman the company could be wound up in the public interest on petition by the secretary of state under section 124a of the insolvency act 1986  the third situation is tied back to existing powers in the insolvency act that allow the secretary of state to wind up a company if it is in the public interest to do so section 124a applies if a company is being investigated under various pieces of legislation including the financial services and markets act 2000 the companies act and the criminal justice act 1987 when it is expedient and in the public interest the secretary of state may seek a windingup order in respect of the company if it is just and equitable to do so however if the company in question is a protected energy company that could lead to an interruption in supply the provisions will therefore allow the secretary of state in situations of that kind to apply for an energy administration order instead of a windingup

gale clause 129 which concerns the strategy for microgeneration was put into the bill in another place a few minutes ago we were given a copy of the governments preferred amendment which i presume will be moved on report to be fair we have not had a chance to read through it in detail or to consider it i am therefore tempted to stick with clause 129 for now it can of course be revisited i would probably suggest that my hon friends do the same  the hon member for milton keynes northeast brian white made his customary well informed and enthusiastic speech highlighting the need to reduce demand that would be a useful outcome of clause 129 it is also important to promote the clause because of the new concept that it represents we have macromanagement of the electricity system\u2014to describe it crudely\u2014but also the important concept of microgeneration according to my brief microgeneration is when each and every householder will no longer only consume energy but will produce it that will engender among householders an interest which has not existed previously because for 30 years we have had uninterrupted supply whenever anyone including me has switched a light on it comes on without a problem however that situation is changing so we need a strategy for microgeneration and a requirement for the secretary of state to implement that strategy  i have not had a chance to study the proposed amendment the minister will propose it in good faith and we will consider it in good faith but for now i support clause 129 it is an extremely important part of the bill and future energy strategy i welcome its presence ", " i do not think that the ministers argument should be that my amendments might go against the house of lords his argument should be based on why he may not proceed with the obligation", " can the minister help the committee by giving us an approximate time scale for the consultation", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation i do not necessarily hold him entirely responsible for such action but i would have expected such an amendment to be tabled in committee while discussing other clauses during the past few days the minister said that he would table amendments on report that is not out of order as such but it would have been better if the amendments had been tabled in committee so that we could consider them in detail and perhaps consider them further on report i am rather disappointed with that aspect of his response that said he agreed than an obligation might be a way forward and he recognised the current problems as well as the fact that transport contributes a huge amount of emissions that must be tackled the minister said that taking action was the only way to solve the problem however a tax incentive could be more attractive which could be one way of dealing with the problem we frequently criticise the united states for its approach to emissions about six years ago i visited detroit\u2014i think that you were on the same trip mr sayeed\u2014when we considered how the usa was developing clean car technology frankly it left us standing still to my knowledge there is nothing comparable in this country to what we saw then i notice that you are seeking to bring me back to order mr sayeed although i am a little disappointed that the minister has not tabled such an amendment in committee i am encouraged in general by his words so i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment  amendment by leave withdrawn  clause 128 ordered to stand part of the bill it being twentyfive minutes past eleven oclock the chairman adjourned the committee without question put pursuant to the standing order  adjourned till this day at halfpast two oclock ", " the amendments are designed to strengthen clause 128 which introduces a renewable transport fuel obligation the background is the eu biofuels directive 200330ec which was adopted on 8 may 2003 and which set a target of 2 per cent of the market being accounted for by alternative fuels by 2005 and 575 per cent by 2010 climate change and security of supply are cited as key drivers the government must report their plan for targets to the european union by july 2004 whether one approves of things coming from europe\u2014some people do and some do not\u2014the government must respond to the directive they also have to indicate how they will increase the targets for biofuel use everybody is aware of the case for biofuels it is important in terms of security of supply that we develop them as an alternative as the last few weeks have demonstrated those members of the committee with longer memories\u2014that probably includes everybody\u2014can remember the problems of the early 1970s that were caused by being overreliant on one fuel in electricity production just as in fuel we need a balanced energy policy that does not cause us to be overdependent on any one source  the clause provides that the secretary of state may by regulations introduce a renewable transport fuel obligation my amendments would change it slightly providing that the secretary of state shall introduce that obligation the clause is strengthened by making the obligation a requirement rather than a possibility  i have given the committee the reasons why adopting such an approach is important in terms of security of supply and helping the environment in addition it would help farmers who may be involved in providing the raw material given how things are i am not so naive as to think that our own farmers would be the primary source a lead time would be required so quite a bit of the raw material could come from abroad but takes no great leap of imagination to see an opportunity for our farmers while they continue to be paid not to produce on land  in the age of joinedup government\u2014i do not think we actually have it but we were promised it and we all aspire to it\u2014i am sure that the relevant departments could arrange between themselves to ensure that the common agricultural policy was amended in a way that would help our farmers to benefit from the clause i support the retention of clause 128 but think it would be strengthened by the obligation being made a requirement rather than an option", " we could dispute how much extra capacity the clause would bring on board for evermore there are theoretical figures but 27 gw of plant with planning permission is a real figure that already exists", " on the concern that if chp were to be removed from the calculation i presume that the argument will be that as there is less electricity the renewables target of 49 per cent will be 49 per cent of a smaller amount that i think is the industrys argument the minister listed three options to counter that but there is a fourth the 49 per cent could become 59 per cent that would directly address the point", " i want to speak in support of clause 120 and its retention in the bill partly for reasons that have already been given and so i hope not to detain the committee too long the main reason for including the clause in the bill is to assist the reduction of co2 emissions if we imagine a situation where we had a nuclear industry an increased contribution from renewables and a considerable contribution from chp we would be going a long way towards reducing our co2 emissions i thought that was our aim if we are to achieve that reduction in emissions we must think a little more radically if we allow the nuclear industry to wane and if we attempt to bring up the percentage of electricity from renewables kicking and screaming we will go nowhere on emissions we have to do more than that if we are serious about reducing them that is what the clause is about  as the hon member for southampton test said electricity generated from chp is not a renewable as such but it contributes to the reduction in emissions by rejecting the clause we are saying that because we cannot reduce emissions completely we will not reduce them at all that is how opposition to the clause comes across it is a different technology and does not necessarily compete with renewables as the combined heat and power association said wind  farms cannot produce industrial steam it is a completely different concept a different contribution to the generation of power  obviously the government have recognised the role and value of chp to some extent by not subjecting it to the climate change levy it is curious that an industry that contributes to some extent to emissions is excluded from that whereas the nuclear industry which does not contribute is not excluded it is rather convoluted thinking nevertheless i do not want my remarks to be misinterpreted i welcome that little bit of encouragement that is given to combined heat and power yet it is obviously not enough because the target of 10 gw by 2010 is looking extremely ambitious indeed it is unlikely to be achieved as we have not even reached the 2000 target of 5 gw as the hon member for milton keynes northeast said the capacity fell with combined heat and power in 2002  it is obviously not working so far there was clearly a point when the people involved in chp plants were quite encouraged because they went in for planning permission for some of these plants i understand that some 2700 mw of combined heat and power capacity has received planning permission but is on hold or has been scrapped that loses a potential investment of around \u00a31 billion those are the figures that i have been given i have no way of verifying the figures but if i am wrong or the minister disagrees i am sure that he will challenge them that 2700 mw would be a significant contribution to the target of 10000 mw if it could be activated  the other problem is that combined heat and power plants often run at only 50 per cent capacity there is insufficient incentive for chp plants to be used as much as they should be and that concerns me i shall again quote from a letter that all hon members may have received from the combined heat and power association which contains a few disturbing facts it states that the government has repeatedly asked the chp industry for suggestions of what can be done to get the uk back on track to its chp target we have done this only to find each suggestion has been blocked by other parts of government i am sure that the minister was not one of those who blocked those suggestions but will he explain why the combined heat and power association says that its suggestions have been blocked there may be good reasons for blocking those suggestions but i would appreciate an explanation  the letter goes on to state that senior dti officials have gone out of their way to whip up opposition that is a serious charge alarmingly it continues  leading uk chp companies who have invested many millions of pounds in enhancing the competitiveness of the uk business and boosting the uks security of supply have so far been denied the opportunity to discuss face to face with ministers how matters could be progressed apparently only when clause 120 is removed from the bill will a meeting be considered i find that surprising it does not chime with my experience of dealing with the minister so i am sure that there is a simple explanation which we must receive  i have sympathy with amendment no 40 tabled by the hon member for milton keynes northeast but it weakens clause 120 ", " i accept the hon gentlemans explanation it is a matter of real politics and the art of the possible i seek to retain clause 120 but i wait to hear the ministers response to my points and those of other hon members before advising my colleagues whether to support the amendment the amendment would slightly weaken the clause but it might be better than nothing depending on the ministers response for now i would vote to retain clause 120 and i will ask my hon friends to do the same", " there are many other reasons", " how nice to see you back in the chair mr sayeed i tabled amendment no 92 which would strike out subsection 1 as a probing amendment to enable us to discuss the clause and i hope that the minister puts my mind at rest on a couple of concerns the clause is designed to facilitate the renewables obligation and make it more workable i am worried that the late buyout aspect will add to the problem rather than address it recently txu and maverick energy have gone into liquidation owing the renewables obligation buyout fund \u00a3236 million although the government have said that they will consult on the issue of shortfalls they have rightly and understandably said also that the industry must bear the risk the difficulty is that the company that goes into liquidation does not pay the shortfall the rest of the industry picks up the bill  my noble friends in the house of lords were concerned about that\u2014an amendment was discussed but not accepted i am not seeking to reintroduce that amendment but i ask the minister to explain how the clause will make the buyout fund more secure and enable it to work more flexibly and better  speaking of betta\u2014british electricity trading and transmission arrangements\u2014i also ask the minister what the logic is when we move to that from new electricity trading arrangements in keeping the buyout funds in england and scotland separate i am not seeking to remove the clause or to add to it but i would appreciate an explanation on the issues i have raised ", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs 1  what plans she has to expand the warm front grant

me to order mr sayeed if i attempted to emulate that speech\u2014not that i could\u2014but i shall remind the committee of certain aspects clauses 100 and 101 refer to the problems that might be encountered for shipping and navigation if we build wind farms in the sea we have heard both in this committee and in outside debate that it might be more acceptable to build wind farms in the sea rather than on land there are many environmental objections to building wind farms on land but that is also true for building them in the sea my hon friend outlined a number of those problems the most important of which is the possible danger to shipping she also mentioned the problems for recreational activities such as yachting and fishing  last year while attending the conservative party conference in blackpool i had an interesting meeting with the royal society for the protection of birds which is still the largest membership charity in the country\u2014the minister is nodding so that must be right its members wanted to discuss the problems that might be caused to the common scoter by the proposed site off morecambe bay  there are many issues as to exactly where wind farms should be built in the sea when we look to the skies we may see aeroplanes but it is not true that they can fly anywhere in the same way it may seem that the sea is a vast area but there are problems associated with building wind farms just anywhere  the issue was previously considered by the transport committee which stated  clauses 100 and 101 must remain in the bill my hon friend talked about the chamber of shipping the british marine aggregate producers association and uk major ports group which all have concerns about the issue the secretary of state for trade and industry stated  we do indeed intend to retain the substances of those clauses that is open to interpretation it depends what she means by the substances of the clauses no doubt the minister will tell us what she means

collision is inevitable\u2014official report 10 may 2004 vol 421 c 4692 those are strong words indeed i would be grateful if the minister addressed my points and more importantly the substantial

delight mr sayeed to do so under your chairmanship during the week that we have just enjoyed in our constituencies i was considering how to resolve the issue that the hon gentleman addressed i wondered if the right time to do so was later in the bill but on reading this amendment i can understand why it has been tabled here it is important if he will forgive me for saying so to look beyond his natural eloquence and consider whether the amendment addresses what we are trying to achieve having wrestled with the issue myself i think by and large that it does it addresses not only the industrys concerns but those of consumers across the country  we are extending neta to scotland which raises the issue of the important relationship between where electricity is generated and where it is consumed there is the argument with which i teased the hon gentleman that if one phones a longer distance on the telephone network one pays a greater price for the privilege however as he also pointed out there are analogies that suggest the opposite might be the best way forward i am not sure which is the right system perhaps a mixture of the two  we must consider the generation of electricity throughout the kingdom or at least great britain in that context rather than in a piecemeal way especially given the challenge of global warming i am sure that you mr sayeed will call me out of order if i stray too far down that road but what bothers me about global warming is that as well as doing our bit\u2014i use the word advisedly\u2014we must address the problems that global warming will cause throughout the developing world we must not think that we can solve them i want to make that point because it is important that we do not handicap ourselves with systems that will not have a global impact that said i shall move swiftly on however that is not an excuse for doing nothing although we should bear it in mind ", " the hon gentleman is absolutely right i spoke earlier about my visit to finland i have already made it clear that i believe that its advances in the nuclear industry should be exported to this country i accept that anything we can develop would be beneficial my concern is about advances in places such as india and china which have massive populations and the enormous demand that they will create it is important that those countries too address the issue of global warming this country contributes only 2 per cent of the worlds carbon emissions which is a very small amount wiping out all our carbon emissions would have virtually no impact in

people there demonstrated exceptional skill my point was that we would have a better chance of retaining even more scientists if we also had an ongoing programme it is not contradictory to say those two things my hon friend the member for salisbury identified a big problem that faces the uk the skills shortage in relation to very technical work that shortage is not just in the nuclear industry but in the aerospace industry which is big in my constituency and which cannot attract sufficient numbers of people with the right kind of skills there are even skill shortages in the nhs in terms of the more scientific work that is undertaken you are frowning at me mr sayeed as if to suggest that i am out of order but my analogy concerns the skills shortage that problem has been faced by successive governments it has not been brought about by this government  ucas which deals with all the applications for university is also in my area when i visited that organisation recently i was told that there was a serious problem with people applying for sciencebased courses which reinforces the strong point made by my hon friend the member for salisbury the amendment seeks detail of the governments correct intention to ensure that there is a skilled work force that can undertake the cleanup and decommissioning of nuclear sites  the minister mentioned that clause 152b provides that the strategy must set out how it proposes to ensure the maintenance and development in the united kingdom of a skilled workforce however neither that nor unusually the ministers response entirely satisfied me i think that we have made the point that we intended through our discussion and so i reluctantly beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment  amendment by leave withdrawn ", " i beg to

secure pending the commencement of their decommissioning in an attempt to gain the support of the hon member for lewes i emphasise that that does not mean that the nda would in any way be dragged into the longterm operation of nuclear sites for the generation of electricity however the amendment would require that before decommissioning is begun the maximum amount of income should be drawn from those sites the hon member for lewes might be prepared to support that  amendment no 67 is linked to my earlier amendment no 55 which would have required the nda to leave the site in a state in which it could be used in the future if that were appropriate amendment no 67 would require an assessment to be included of the possibility and practicability of extending the productive life of the site where appropriate i believe that i have already made the case for that and so will not detain the committee further by repeating myself ", " i entirely agree with the minister when we get to it amendment no 56 will touch on that issue so i will not go too far down that road now i still think that we must set out exactly what we are going to do i am straying on to the next amendment but if we are to retain a skilled work force we must promise them more than just decommissioning work there must be better career prospects than that if they are to be retained i hope that the minister will forgive me if i rather indelicately suggest that he has replaced one empty phrase with two empty phrases we need action to prove that we are serious the minister conceded that the existing sites would be the most appropriate as my hon friend the member for salisbury said there might be a lack of available sites although places such as sizewell and sellafield would probably be more welcoming there will be a natural objection in some areas to nuclear activity given that attitude we may not be overrun with offers of sites for new nuclear build or for extending the life of nuclear generation therefore it is important that we leave the existing sites in such a state that they can be used should the industry\u2014not the nda or the government\u2014wish to take up that option given the security of supply issue which i have touched on and the environmental problems that we face i must press the amendment to a vote to demonstrate that at least conservative members are serious when they say that the option must be kept open  question put that the amendment be made\u2014the committee divided ayes 3 noes 13", " i beg to move amendment no 56 inclause 12 page 10 line 4 at end

amend clause 122a which refers to a skilled workforce able to undertake the work of decommissioning nuclear installations and of cleaning up nuclear sites we could go further and say that we want a skilled work force capable of taking the nuclear industry onwards and upwards but all the amendment asks is that details be published of how that skilled workforce is to be recruited trained and maintained as i said earlier i am not persuaded that nuclear scientists will be retained in this country if all they have to work on is decommissioning china is considering building new nuclear reactors and it will not be the only country to do so many people involved in the nuclear industry may well be tempted to go abroad if we are not careful the amendment does not address that but merely asks for details to be published about how a skilled work force would be recruited trained and maintained ", " i will take up the ministers invitation to correct him it is easy to argue with what someone did not say and i did not say inferior undemanding or second rate i suggested that if the only option was decommissioning and generation in the nuclear industry did not have a future the attractions proposed to keep people on our shores would be inadequate i do not think that the incentives would be as attractive as they would be if we had a vibrant nuclear industry with a great future", " i agree with the hon gentleman but i do not want him to confuse my amendment with dragging the nda into being a nuclear generator that is not what the amendment is about it has to do with leaving open the possibility of the future use of the site for someone\u2014not the nda\u2014to take forward", " to pick up on the ministers final point i do not think that the amendment would give the nda an obligation to use one type of fuel or energy source what it would do is\u2014to use the ministers words\u2014leave the option open i hesitate to say so but the ministers reply was uncharacteristically unpersuasive we have heard a lot about leaving the option open both from this minister  and from ministers in another place but as my hon friend the member for salisbury said it is an empty phrase perhaps he did not use those words what does the phrase mean new nuclear build is always an option how could we close that option we cannot\u2014it is always there so leaving the option open is an empty phrase especially in opposing the amendment  the amendment does not suggest that the nda should be involved in promoting the nuclear industry in any way it says that in physical terms we should leave open the option or the possibility of using that site for nuclear generation in the future it would not in any way oblige the nda to be involved it would not ask the nda to approve of nuclear power ", " good morning mr sayeed i listened carefully to what the minister said in discussing amendment no 17 but i am not entirely persuaded that we should accept amendment no 16 without a vote the amendments differ slightly clause 135 which amendment no 16 would delete goes a little further as it talks about grants and loans and is much more targeted on helping the areas that need a lot of help i visited sellafield a short while ago i am sure that the minister is aware of the strong concern in the area about the potential loss of jobs that cuts across the labour and conservative parties although i am not sure what the liberal democrat approach in that area is trade unionists labour party supporters and conservative party supporters are concerned about what will happen to sellafield they predict that there could be a threat to as many as 8000 jobs in an area that already suffers high deprivation ", " i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that intervention and i apologise if i have misrepresented him i am referring to the lack of activity by his party in that area on the longterm future of the industry itself i am concerned that the industry should have a future not just in terms of the decommissioning which is probably where we differ he is nodding in agreement there is concern in sellafield about the potential loss of 8000 jobs in a highly deprived and remote area where it would be difficult to attract the necessary new business the loss of activity at nearby barrow has not helped although the minister makes a good case for amendment no 17 which would replace clause 135 i am not entirely persuaded that we should go down that route i would prefer the strengthened proposal given the seriousness of the situation in sellafield and the concern in the area ", " i beg to move amendment no 55 inclause 12 page 9 line 44 at end insert\u2014e the need to preserve where desirable the possibility of the future use of the site for nuclear generation we come to the nittygritty of what decommissioning means i shall speak to the amendment for a few minutes amendments nos 56 and 57 are linked to it to an extent so if i say what i need to on this amendment there will be no need to go into huge detail on those  the amendment would apply when the nda was carrying out its functions and this matter depends on where one comes from on the nuclear issue we would not claim to be pro or antinuclear just as we would not claim to be pro or antiwind we consider each energy source on its merits and consider what is necessary for security of supply which we discussed in great detail during the first sitting i tabled the amendment for several reasons including in part security of supply to which i shall return in a moment  but also because decisions are needed long before any crisis that we might reach with security of supply particularly in the nuclear industry it is necessary and very important to plan for the long term  i have spoken before about the contribution that the nuclear industry makes to electricity generation\u2014about 22 per cent of our electricity i got my figures wrong when i first spoke about this but over the next 20 years to 2023 or 2024 that 22 per cent will be reduced to just 2 per cent which is a significant fall in electricity generated from nuclear sources that bothers me for the reasons that i gave a few moments ago when i spoke about employment opportunities at for example sellafield it also bothers me from the point of view of security of supply because where will the missing 20 per cent come from  if we manage to bring on renewables to the extent that they can replace the entire 20 per cent that will be a good achievement and i hope we can do that however it is looking increasingly unlikely that we will be able to do so even if we succeeded we would not have advanced at all in terms of the effect of carbon emissions on the environment which is a serious consideration  let us say that we increase the contribution of renewables to 20 per cent by 2020 which is the governments target just imagine how good the carbon savings would be if we also had a nuclear industry producing at the current level\u2014in other words if more than 40 per cent of our electricity was produced from carbonfree sources that would be a tremendous advancement for the environment and for security of supply because our reliance on gas from faraway places such as russia would be greatly reduced we should take that issue very seriously  just this week two things have perhaps made us look at the nuclear industry slightly differently the first is the article by the scientist james lovelock that appeared in mondays edition of the independent he says that a nuclear industry will be essential if we are to achieve the carbon savings that we need and avoid the problems of global warming which he rightly identifies as extremely serious and probably more urgent than was previously realised given that he is a celebrated green his proposals and views are very interesting he calls on the green lobby to drop its opposition to nuclear power he recognises that there are risks associated with it but says that if we are serious about reducing global warming which we need to do more urgently than was previously thought we must embrace nuclear power as a main energy source  that was interesting but even more interesting were the comments of the former energy minister the right hon member for cunninghame north mr wilson who said it was a selfevident nonsense for the uk to run down its nuclear capacity while there is an unprecedented emphasis on the need to reduce carbon emissions he went on to say  nuclear power is our only significant source of noncarbon electricity it is the bird in the hand yet the green lobby wants to shoot it  that was a significant contribution from someone who is not on our benches we need to take those two warnings seriously  the second interesting thing that has happened this week is that china has decided that it has a problem with security of supply it is considering building four new reactors i have already mentioned concerns about security of supply in finland which i visited in december the finns are building a fifth reactor they have not found the waste issue too difficult to deal with they have been imaginative about solving the problem and are using a simple process to do so we could have dealt with the problem equally efficiently  i do not want to stray too far from my overall point which is that the nda ought to have security of electricity supply in mind when carrying out its duties and should do everything possible to preserve the possibility of using the site for nuclear generation in future ", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what further research she proposes to undertake to investigate tb in wildlife and if she will make a statement", " the undersecretary is extremely courteous in giving way he is expressing great sympathy for amendment no 99 although he cannot agree with all of it will he therefore reconsider it with a view to accepting a slightly amended version on report", " my point was not about leaving in those three sentences it may be that we agree that the secretary of state should have the ultimate responsibility but the more important part of the amendment states that the nda shall carry out anassessment of the ability of the person in control to pay for it that is what i am getting at would the undersecretary consider accepting that point on report ", " in a sense mr obrien we have already discussed amendments nos 53 and 54 amendment no 54 refers to the revocation of a direction but as i could not persuade the committee to put directions before parliament i do not suppose that i am likely to gain support for putting the revocation of a direction before parliament therefore i do not wish to move amendment no 53 question proposed that the clause stand part of the bill ", " the minister refers to the amendment rather selectively it states that the nda shallpresent    an analysis to the secretary of state and the nda following consultation with the secretary of state shall    determine how the costs of the decommissioning and cleanup work shall be covered without that amendment and the amendments tabled by the hon member for lewes the nda\u2014in other words the taxpayer\u2014could pick up the entire bill i do not understand the ministers objection to amendment no 99 ", " i want to speak briefly in support of the amendments tabled by the hon member for lewes and in support of my amendment no 99 it relates to clause 24 which covers the financial responsibilities of the nda it is obvious to the committee although i will restate it that i do not come from the same position as the hon member for lewes with respect to the nuclear industry it has made a valuable contribution and there remains one for it to make in the future however i agree with him that it needs to be economic i agree too with what i think he is getting at in his amendments certainly amendment no 99 is intended to ensure that where there is a liability\u2014let us say that british energy has a liability for waste cleanup and decommissioning\u2014there should be an obligation as far as possible to deal with that liability  a conflict seemed to arise in discussion earlier the undersecretary appeared when i challenged him about the eu position to be saying that the government were prepared to bail out\u2014in the words of the hon member for lewes\u2014the private sector in the nuclear industry otherwise why were we discussing whether that would be unfair state aid the undersecretary seemed to be willing that that should happen perhaps in some circumstances it might be necessary however it now seems that we are being told that it will not happen but that it will be up to the licensee the operator of the site to pay we need clarification i thought so when i first read the bill and after the debate i am even more convinced of it therefore i am happy to support the amendment", " i largely agree with the undersecretary who made his case reasonably and persuasively however i point out to him that my amendment no 99 is a little more accommodating than those tabled by the liberal democrats\u2014although i support those too my amendment took a slightly different line which is why it relates to a different clause clause 24 appears to suggest that the nda cannot charge the private sector that was my reading of it which is why i tabled amendment no 99 which says that the nda shall carry out an assessment of the ability of the person in control to cover the costs of the decommissioning and cleanup work which the nda considers necessary it goes on to say that the nda following consultation with the secretary of state shall then determine how the costs of the decommissioning and cleanup work shall be covered so my amendment would not have been in conflict with what the undersecretary very reasonably said however i accept his persuasive arguments and i shall not push the matter to a vote although it would not necessarily have been detrimental to the environment and public safety ", " i am not entirely convinced by the undersecretary about how unnecessary the amendments are i mentioned for example that thorp has an order book of \u00a312 billion just for reprocessing spent fuel i am not aware of any transfer of that size going through without some reference to parliament it seems extraordinary to want to avoid that the undersecretary said that it would delay it for up to a month is he suggesting that designation will be made and acted upon within a month that seems a very short time scale", " the hon gentleman is right in another clause\u2014i cannot quote it offhand as i do not have the benefit of the undersecretarys civil servants\u2014a designation can be made a long time ahead what i am proposing is not extraordinary with the proviso that i can speak briefly to amendments nos 59 and 60 which are linked to this proposal i shall divide the committee on this important matter question put that the amendment be made\u2014the committee divided ayes 6 noes 12", " before he concludes on that point will he make a reference to the position with regard to the european unions unfair state aid rules", " i fear that the situation might be rather worse than the hon gentleman describes given the undersecretarys honest reply to my intervention we do not know whether they can clear the sites or not would not it have been better to clarify that before publishing the bill", " speak for yourself", " i beg to move amendment no 50 inclause 6 page 4 line 30 at end insert\u2014 3a such a direction must not be given by the secretary of state before he has formally consulted the person in control of the site in question and has laid a copy of that proposed direction before parliament", " i am not sure that i can quite match the excitement generated by the hon member for lewes with his amendments in fact i am not sure that i am going to try in a way it is a pity that we cannot discuss amendments nos 59 and 60 now because they are the background to what i am getting at in these amendments amendments nos 59 and 60 if i may refer to them briefly describe the position of british energy the relevance of which will become clear as i proceed in speaking to amendments nos 50 51 and 52 i am trying to show due respect to parliament in the sense that although the number of designations will be small their importance will be large  the electricity miscellaneous provisions act 2003 repealed sections 72 and 74 of the electricity act 1989 and gives the minister the power to repeal to any extent any of the other provisions of part 2 of the 1989 act by statutory instrument as hon members will remember the 2003 act was introduced to rescue british energy and although small was extremely wideranging the minister may want to correct me but it seemed to give the government the power to bring british energy under state control if that were desirable the importance of that is that the nda can take over only installations or sites that are publicly owned  if the government can take over parts of british energy that would become an organisation or an installation that could be taken over by the nda i think that i have interpreted the position correctly given that the minister has such wideranging powers under the 2003 act and because any transfers will be very large in importance it is not unreasonable to ask for the proposals to be laid before parliament a month before they are enacted that is not much to ask  we have had an interesting debate on the future of sellafield and in particular thorp and on the ndas possible role in respect of reprocessing in a parliamentary answer on 15 march the minister said  as far as spent nuclear fuel is concerned thorps order book amounts to some \u00a312 billion\u2014official report 15 march 2004 vol 419 c 70w that figure will probably alarm the liberal democrats greatly but the point is that it is a massive sum and means an awful lot of work for the people in that area making transfers of that amount is very significant it is not asking too much for the proposal to designate such a site to be put before parliament a month before the transfer comes into effect following the ministers consultation with the site in question which is also part of my amendment  there is another aspect to this which i mentioned on second reading i do not know whether the minister has had a chance to consider it although i am sure that his officials will be up to speed on it so no doubt he will be if for example british energy or a  part of it were taken over by the government for the purposes of the nda\u2014to clean up or decommission\u2014would that represent an infringement of european union rules on unfair state aid i am not saying that it would i do not know and i am genuinely asking the question from ignorance but it should certainly be considered the relevance of that to the amendments is that if that occurs it is only right and fair that parliament should be warned about it in advance\u2014interruption i am getting rather worried that the liberal democrat spokesman is agreeing with me but i am sure that i can cope with that for the reasons that i have given i commend the amendments ", " i am grateful to the minister for his explanation he makes a good point about the longterm nature of the work that the nda will undertake and the consequent longterm nature of the nda itself i am happy to accept his advice on that matter however i am slightly concerned that he says he will follow the guidance on public appointments i think he said that it is likely that there will be scope for only one reappointment and a maximum term of 10 years", " i am grateful to the minister for that clarification paragraph 13 of the schedule states thata person is eligible for reappointment on any number of occasions there is therefore a slight discrepancy there is an inconsistency between the minister saying that he does not envisage an appointment continuing for longer than 10 years and the statement that people could be eligible for reappointment on any number of occasions ", " i am grateful to the minister for that explanation which is now on the record it might have been better to reword paragraph 13 to reflect it and perhaps to say that an appointment would be for two terms except in exceptional circumstances that would have been clearer and more transparent however i do not wish to extend the debate and therefore i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdrawn ", " i beg to move amendment no 46 inschedule 1 page 152 line 5 at end insertfollowing consultation with the chairman of the nda", " i thank the minister for that response his last sentence won me over so to speak because he concluded that the figure i proposed\u2014about \u00a3750000\u2014is not too ridiculous given his sympathetic remarks on the need to control costs at the top of the organisation i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdrawn ", " i rise briefly to support the hon gentlemans amendment one problem that the nuclear industry has perhaps had in the past\u2014reference was made to it this morning although i cannot remember which member used this word\u2014was its mystique as we move forward and clean up various operations the nda must be seen to be transparent and work with members of the public i cannot think what objection there should be to the amendment but i am sure i am about to hear it from the minister", " i beg to move amendment no 45 inschedule 1 page 151 line 11 leave out five and insert three the amendment would reduce the appointment time of the chairman and nonexecutive members from five years to three while i would be the first to recognise that we can argue for ever more about how many years it should be i felt that five might be somewhat excessive especially for a completely new organisation i would welcome the ministers comments and perhaps an explanation of why he feels that five years is appropriate at this point in the cycle ", " the amendments that we have tabled come from the opposite point of view to that expressed by the hon member for lewes i propose that before the chairman nonexecutive directors and chief executive are appointed there should be discussions with the industry and i have specified bnfl british energy nirex and the united kingdom atomic energy authority the nda will deal with work of the highest importance indeed it is difficult to imagine anything more important in terms of the environment and public safety the work will be extremely complicated as well as important in fact not much is more complicated than the nuclear industry i am not talking about seeking the industrys permission before making the appointments\u2014that would be wrong\u2014but it would be sensible to seek the advice and opinions of people in the industry beforehand we are involved in setting up yet another body i do not know whether it officially qualifies as a quango but we have thousands of quangos some are useful and some are not but it is very important that this body be useful and effective it would therefore be rather foolish to disregard or reject the advice that may be given by the ukaea which has been operating since 1954 and by bnfl which i understand has been operating for 30 years if not more that is the basis of the amendments they do not suggest that those bodies should have to grant permission but merely that their opinions should be sought given the importance of the work that will be carried out that is the least that we should expect ", " that final point which was raised by the hon member for lewes a few minutes ago is important according to a written answerthe government are giving consideration to the future of nirex it will only be possible to set out definitively the relationship between nirex and the nuclear decommissioning authority once this consideration has been completed\u2014official report 10 march 2004 vol 418 c 1506w i hope that that consideration has been completed and that the minister can tell us about it it is important to establish what that relationship will be as the hon member for lewes said it is also important to establish what the relationship between the nda and the industry will be i do not want to speak too much on that because i have tabled relevant amendments to later clauses  we welcome the creation of the nda successive governments have undoubtedly ducked the nuclear waste issue which is unfortunate and need not have been the case just last december i had the pleasure of visiting finland to see what that country does with its nuclear industry it is building a fifth reactor which is not disproportionately costly and has made some interesting arrangements perhaps we can return to that  the important point is that the finns are also dealing very effectively with waste they have one underground repository for lowlevel and mediumlevel waste and are building a second for dealing with highlevel waste when one considers how efficiently and cleanly they are dealing with that and what a small surface area is taken up one wonders why we in the uk did not deal with these matters as effectively and efficiently that is to be regretted but i welcome the fact that the issue is finally being addressed  we have already expressed many concerns about how the nda will be formulated how it will work and what relationships it will have in principle however it is good that it is being set up there is a great deal for it to do and it has many issues to deal with which we will discuss later however we support the clause ", " on a point of order mr sayeed i said earlier that the amount of electricity derived from nuclear sources would be down to 2 per cent in 10 years i apologise but i should have said 20 years", " in 20 years\u2014by 2024\u2014it will be 2 per cent", " the hon gentleman is right to suggest that the past record of the nuclear industry has left a cost legacy however does he accept that with changed technology those costs would not necessarily be repeated", " i welcome you to the committee mr sayeed we have had a long debate over three sittings on these important clauses and most members of the committee have taken part which is a welcome change as government members often do not participate  we have heard much about the sustainable energy act 2003 on which i made my first speech as shadow spokesman the speech was memorable as it took about 30 seconds to make at about halfpast 2 on a tuesday when it finally got through the commons the act too was memorable because it was considerably weakened compared with the original drafting because targets were removed since enactment an earlyday motion has been tabled on strengthening the measure  clause 3 which has drawn a great deal of support from both sides of the committee is useful because it strengthens the bill in equal measure to the weakening of the sustainable energy act due to the removal of targets  i asked the minister to justify replacing clause 2 with new clause 7 and he has gone some way to doing so but i must ask my hon friends to support clause stand part my only slight concern which relates to the mechanics of the committee and how we consider amendments is that i have considerable sympathy for amendment a which was tabled by the hon member for sherwood and which would include coal methane in the energy sources listed in clause 2 and indeed in the ministers new clause i think we will have an opportunity to vote on that separately and i shall ask my hon friends to consider supporting it  we want to keep the clauses as they stand i am becoming concerned about the position of renewables and that point is emphasised by the intervention about nuclear energy by my hon friend the member for salisbury mr key again we can return to that  debate in the near future\u2014probably under the next set of amendments\u2014but it shows the position that we are in as we discussed on second reading the contribution from nuclear sources is about 22 per cent of our electricity in 10 years time that will be down to 2 per cent there is a very long way to go between now and then to bring renewables up to speed to replace the missing 20 per cent even if we achieve that we will have gone nowhere on carbon reductions because nuclear does not contribute to carbon emissions my hon friend made a good point if prematurely and no doubt we can return to it i ask my hon friends to support the retention of clauses 2 and 3 ", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what cost there will be to farmers from the cattle passports scheme and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement on a the effectiveness of the british cattle movement service and b delays in processing records from farmers", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that the new schemes set up under common agricultural policy reform will be simpler to administer and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement on the rate of takeup of training of farmers at entry level under the modulation scheme", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what discussions she has had with eu ministers on compulsory insurance for product recall costs and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what assessment she has made of the future profitability of farms following the introduction of the single farm payments scheme", "to ask the deputy prime minister for what valid reason local councils may reject proposals made by government inspectors under ppg10 for major housing development sites and if he will make a statement", " an obsession", " my hon friend asks why attempts are being made to remove the targets but the sustainable energy act 2003 was also weakened by having its targets removed when it was a bill", " i begin this part of my remarks by saying what a pleasure it is to see you chairing this committee mr sayeed we look forward to working with you before lunch i was in the process of saying that we had had a good debate on the security of supply it took all morning but it was probably right to take so much time because it is an important issue in summing up the minister expressed sympathy for the clause that had been inserted by the lords and in particular for my amendment no 41 my understanding is that he promised to consider the amendment further he said that he was not happy with all of it but that there were parts that he would discuss with the opposition immediately after the forthcoming recess with a view to perhaps introducing something on report on the basis of those sympathetic remarks i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment  amendment by leave withdrawn  clause 1 disagreed to ", " i shall speak more widely on the clause as it exists which was inserted by the lords indeed discussing lords amendments is becoming a habit will the minister explain why he cannot run with the lords amendment as it stands and why he feels the need to expand it i am sure that there are good reasons for that the list of fuels and energy sources in the bill is impressive there is a need to explain what is going on with regard to the development and the deployment of each different technology we have clean coal technology which we heard quite a bit about this morning it is important to explore the possibilities of clean coal technology i am not too technical a person but i understand that such technologies exist i also understand that they are unfortunately rather expensive as we were saying this morning the issue concerns how to obtain investment in the generating industry to ensure that coalfired power stations can survive  while we are at it we might want to explore how the mining industry can survive too clean coal technology provides a costeffective and flexible means of generating electricity we heard a lot about wind this morning\u2014no doubt we shall hear a lot more about it before we have finished with the bill\u2014but the problem with it is that it is very intermittent and requires backup from another traditional source of electricity coal is that traditional source backup is not possible using nuclear power although it is by gas and coal if we are to meet the co2 and other targets that are set by various eu directives we must establish clean coal technology  we discussed biomass in a recent statutory instrument committee and it presents obvious opportunities a government amendment later in the bill addresses biofuel and that will certainly be an  interesting discussion when we reach it i do not intend to go through in detail the other amendments but as a result of parliamentary questions that i have asked i have been concerned about the relatively low level of investment in research and development of those energy sources for the future however i hope that they are not too far in the future there is the renewables obligation and the need to produce electricity cleanly so i hope that we can develop such sources of power rather quicker than we appear to be doing we do not hear an awful lot about what is being done that is not to suggest than nothing is being done but we do not hear a lot about for example how we are developing geothermal sources the point of the original amendment was to enable us to hear more about how the reports shall contain information on the development of new energy sources which is good if nothing is going on we must be aware of that and address it  i do not want to say much more at this stage except to repeat that i should like the minister to explain what the principal difference is between clause 2 and new clause 7 which he has tabled ", " we have had a long debate\u2014two and a half hours\u2014on this clause but it has been worth while i think 13 members have taken part and a good many points have been raised on amendment no 41 i listened carefully to what the minister said and as i said in an intervention i thank him for his sympathetic approach my understanding is that he wants to consider our amendment and that discussions with the opposition parties will take place shortly after the recess at the end of next week given that he recognised that the government have responsibility for energy supplies and security\u2014i think that his exact words were that that responsibility must rest with the government\u2014 it being twentyfive minutes past eleven oclock the chairman adjourned the committee without question put pursuant to the standing order  adjourned till this day at halfpast two oclock ", " i appreciate the ministers sympathetic approach to the amendment he will acknowledge that i said that we were attempting to strike a balance to satisfy those in the industry who were concerned about the mediumterm security of supply and those who thought that the lords amendment might inadvertently impede that i am grateful to him for saying that he will consider introducing a sympathetic amendment on report how does he intend to finesse that does he intend to hold discussions with the opposition parties", " i think that the minister would acknowledge that the point that i was trying to make is that the secretary of state has a role in the delivery of gas to this country", " the minister has anticipated the point that i was going to make the government have committed \u00a3117 million to developing offshore wind farms so it is not correct to say that wind power is developing because of its own economics it is being pumpprimed by the government he mentioned the money being allocated to other forms of renewables i do not expect him to have the figures on that to hand but for comparison it would be useful if he could obtain them for the committee so that he could demonstrate the governments commitment to other forms of renewable energy", " the hon gentlemans recollection of what was said by my hon friend the member for eddisbury and me is not accurate my hon friend extended an invitation to the minister to discuss clause 1 as we were not entirely happy with it for the reasons that i have given if the hon gentleman checks hansard he will find that that is the case", " even if the reference is deleted from the constitution that is being prepared we have heard much in the past about how the eu will not gain competence over a certain matter only to find that it gains that very competence in the next treaty", " i echo the ministers remarks not for the last time i am sure indeed i entirely agree that it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship mr obrien i have done so before and i know that an enjoyable experience awaits us all i also echo the ministers remarks about welcoming other hon members however i extend an apology to those who attended the programming subcommittee on monday due to illness i could not attend i apologise for my absence and thank those who did attend  the minister said that the second reading debate was interesting and that we agreed on many of the issues raised we also discussed one or two of the amendments to the bill made by members of another place those matters may be slightly more contentious but they are also important i look forward to debating them the minister spoke of the need to set up the nda and to extend to scotland the electricity trading arrangements for england and wales those are both important aspects of the bill  the bill has 194 clauses and a great many schedules and 24 june may seem a long time away however given that we have one week off for the recess and a day off for the local and european elections and especially given that we must reach clause 83 by 5 oclock next thursday we do not have a great deal of time to debate much of the bill i acknowledge that there is a need to make rapid progress but i hope that that does not mean that we cannot give the bill the detailed consideration that these important matters deserve that said i am pleased to serve on the committee may i say again mr obrien that i look forward to serving under your chairmanship", " i beg to move amendment no 41 inclause 1 page 1 line 4 leave out from state to end of line 5 and insert having regard to the regulatory arrangements shall have a duty to enable the framework whereby the market can ensure the security of electricity and gas supplies and the secretary of state shall make regular reports to parliament on these matters", " the clause has aroused great interest throughout the industry the house of commons and the house of lords i first want to discuss the background to the clause which was inserted in another place before explaining why my hon friends and i have tabled amendments to it it is important to put the issue in context given what the industry has said the electricity act 1989 which the conservative party introduced when in government freed up the market through privatisation there was also the privatisation of gas indeed much of what we did then put us ahead of europe in terms of liberalisation the freeingup of the electricity market led to the lowering  of electricity prices nothing in the clause should be seen as a reversal of that privatisation policy and none of the words that i may utter should be taken to endorse such a reversal i merely intend to explain the background to the lords amendment and to our subsequent amendment to their amendment  the house of lords was persuaded to table an amendment after industry representatives expressed concerns about future security of supply because investment was not as forthcoming as they might have wished great concern was also expressed by many experts in the field including dieter helm\u2014who spoke about such matters on a visit to tewkesbury\u2014and professor ian fells i accept that much of that concern was expressed following the power cuts in california new york and italy and in particular those in london and the west midlands ", " the hon gentleman is right there were different reasons for the power cuts the problem arose mainly because of the system network and that requires investment there was deliberate confusion in the press about the two issues which in some ways have nothing to do with one another overall however there is concern about security of supply and the governments response has given us no comfort the engineering inspectorates investigation into the cuts in london and the west midlands was not published but kept secret that was certainly the case initially although the minister will correct me if i am wrong that did not help in terms of industry confidence  i tabled a parliamentary question which was answered on 29 october 2003 to ask what discussions the secretary of state for trade and industry had had with national grid transco about the failures the answer was that she had not had any but that she was being informed of the situation the government having instructed the engineering inspectorate at the department of trade and industry to investigate did not help matters by not releasing the information  i asked a further parliamentary question which was answered on 11 february as to whether the reports findings would be made public and the answer was that they would not again the governments response to the problems in london and the west midlands gave us no real confidence  we cannot blame consumers for feeling the way they do during the past 30 years people have not leapt out of bed in the morning and thought about energy unless they have leapt out of bed switched on the light and found that it has not come on the power cuts in london and the west midlands brought the issue back on to the agenda  there are problems and concerns in the industry and i have been at meetings with the minister where those concerns have been expressed following the  incidents and concerns on 10 march the bbc ran the now famous programme if    the lights go out that caused some alarm but there would have been more alarm had it been announced in the programme or in the subsequent debate on it that earlier that day\u2014i do not know whether hon members remember but it was a very cold day\u2014national grid transco had given a notice of insufficient margin that meant that its margin of surplus electricity had fallen below the desirable level on that day the margin fell to just under 7 per cent when as stated in a parliamentary answer on 26 february it should have been 203 per cent if that had been known when the programme went out it would have had an even greater impact indeed in 2003 13 such notices were issued by national grid transco  added to the concern in the programme those notices the cuts that we have discussed and the industry concern about a lack of investment contribute to a general concern about the electricity supply in the medium term as we discussed on second reading our indigenous gas supplies are running down and coal generation coalfired power stations and the mining industry are under great environmental pressures particularly from eu directives such as the large combustion plant directive and the emissions trading scheme as things stand the nuclear industry will see further decommissioning from 2008 indeed the bill is largely about decommissioning with renewables struggling to meet their target and further targets looking increasingly unlikely the mediumterm supply situation is not as comfortable as we have enjoyed in the past 30 years  as i said the governments response to those problems has not been entirely reassuring especially with the privacy over the engineering inspectorates report i am concerned that discussions with countries such as russia regarding gas supplies are not as advanced as one would hope given that we will become net importers of gas by 2006 and that the norwegian gas pipeline a treaty for which has been signed will not deliver gas until 2007 we have had what can be described only as vague and ambiguous references to the future of the nuclear industry and an apparent obsession with wind power as the only renewable alternative none of that is reassuring to the industry or the country against that background the lords understandably felt that they needed to act and so tabled what has become clause 1  the clause concerns who is responsible for the security of supply the minister of the crown who is paid by the taxpayer clearly has responsibilities if the energy ministers role is not to keep the lights on and ensure that sufficient energy supplies are available to satisfy the demands of the fourth largest economy of the world i do not know what it is the question is not whether the minister has that responsibility\u2014he clearly does\u2014but how it is exercised  i know that concern has been expressed in the industry about whether clause 1 would lead to interference and i would certainly not want that however we do not have a free market in energy  which in some ways is to be regretted freeing up the industry helped enormously in terms of efficiency and price and constraining the market might have the reverse effect so i repeat that nothing i have said should be taken as endorsing a reversal of the privatisation policy which we initiated i have merely been explaining the background to the lords amendment  as i said a free energy market does not exist to start with ofgem regulates the proceedings to a greater or lesser extent and it is ultimately responsible to the secretary of state the government must implement eu directives the renewables obligation was constructed by the government although we do not oppose it we recognise that it will by its very nature have an increasingly distorting effect on the free market as it increases from 49 per cent this year to 154 per cent the government give capital grants to offshore wind farms planning policy is dictated by central government there is also taxation policy such as the climate change levy that they introduced my point is that the lords amendment would not introduce distortion into the market distortion is in some ways inevitably already there  added to the distortions are the functions relating to security of supply that only the secretary of state can carry out such as the signing of treaties with foreign countries for the building of gas pipelines as was the case with norway recently that role is performed by the government the fact that national grid transco reports its notices about insufficient capacity or margins to the dti also shows that the dti has a responsibility in the matter  far from the lords amendment being a ringing endorsement of state interference\u2014i would not hesitate to vote against it if it were\u2014it represents an attempt in an uncertain energy world to get the government to take their existing responsibilities seriously and to address them urgently the question is how the responsibilities are best exercised i recognise the effect that the lords amendment would have on the industry however the responses of industry representatives have been rather too similar to be coincidental i suspect the presence of the heavy hand of whitehall in the manoeuvrings i am anxious to ensure that this place does nothing to destabilise further the already nervous potential investors in the industry particularly on the generating side that would be counterproductive hence the amendment that we have tabled  we have attempted to address the concerns of many people in the industry about the mediumterm security of the supply of electricity\u2014that point also concerned their lordships\u2014and to address the concerns of those in the industry who feel that the lords amendment might inadvertently impede the investment that the industry needs it is a fine balance to try to strike but i hope that our amendment has struck it the market can provide and it has provided that is why we have tabled this amendment instead of just sticking with the lords amendment we want to create a duty so that the secretary of state can enable the framework to ensure that the market delivers and importantly to ensure that she regularly reports to parliament on the effectiveness of her strategy by framework we mean the right remit being given to ofgem the right planning regulations treaties being in place in time to secure gas supplies the right taxation regime an interpretation of eu directives that is sympathetic to our industry a renewables obligation that delivers what it is supposed to and so on we do not mean interference by government that would be counterproductive  of course we endorse the main objectives of the white paper security of supply reduction in carbon emissions and affordable heating for everyone we recognise that those objectives conflict and that it will be difficult to achieve them all at once nevertheless we support attempts to achieve them and we hope that our amendment will provide the right setting to enable the government\u2014whichever government that may

interesting debate i have counted 24 speakers so far and i hope to be forgiven for not mentioning each and every contribution the debate has ranged widely when one speaks with the various interests in the power industry one hears many different views expressed so it does credit to the house of commons that different views have been expressed by hon members during this good debate on an extremely important issuewhen people wake up in the morning they might not think about the energy supply until they flick the light switch and the light does not come on then it becomes an very important matter of course it is important because the first thing people do when starting their day is use one form of energy or another i am grateful to all who have participated in the debate but i shall be forgiven for mentioning in particular my right hon and hon friendsmy hon friend the member for blaby mr robathan spoke of his personal experiences of renewables\u2014", "i do not know the windingup speeches have started a little sooner than anticipated but perhaps my hon friend is on his way he spoke about his solar panel and his windmill in his back garden my hon friend the member for southwest hertfordshire mr page made his usual considered and sensible speech and my right hon friend the member for southwest norfolk mrs shephard spoke knowledgeably about biofuels my hon friend the member for salisbury mr key made a broadbased and interesting speech and my right hon friend the member for fylde mr jack broadened the debate still further speaking not only about the security of physical supplies but about economic security he did not go so far as to say that the world would be troubled were a gas producers equivalent of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries to arise but i am sure that that is the sort of thing he had in mind given the recent increase in oil prices we have to consider that possibilitymy hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans made a passionate speech he tended to focus on windmills but he was speaking from experience it is wrong of labour members to accuse some hon members and members of the public of being nimbies there is little wrong with being a nimby if it means that one defends the area in which one lives and wants to preserve its beauty and economic prosperity as people in the lake district want to doi hope that members representing other parties will forgive me for not going through every one of their speeches but some very interesting contributions were made the right hon member for copeland dr cunningham spoke with his customary knowledge i was in sellafield fairly recently\u2014i hope that i wrote to him at the time to inform him but fear that i might have been a day late in doing so and postal strikes do not help it must have been in the second delivery which never arrived laughter when i was there i saw how crucial the nuclear industry is to the area it was noticeable that support for the industry cut across the political divide\u2014", "no not the liberals i shall not name the people i met but the industry appeared to command great support from the labour party from the trade unions whose representatives i met and of course from the conservativesthere were many other interesting speeches including from hon members who are concerned about the coal industry as the son of a former miner i can certainly sympathise with the sentiments that they expressedthis is an interesting time to be having this debate an   interesting time for the minister for energy ecommerce and postal services to be holding his portfolio and an interesting time for me to shadow him we in this country have enjoyed 30 years of security of power which has benefited not only those who use power but the exchequer that of course is now changing and we must recognise that indigenous gas and oil supplies are running down there are strong\u2014nobody should underestimate them\u2014environmental challenges to the coal industry and renewables are struggling to keep pace it will be a challenge in which i hope that the government will succeed to meet the targets set for renewables as my hon friend the member for eddisbury mr obrien said in an outstanding opening speech in less than 20 years time unless nuclear power plants are extended nuclear will be reduced to providing just 2 per cent of electricity in this country some labour members\u2014not all by any means\u2014might welcome that but those who do must explain how the remaining 20 per cent will be made up as has been explained if it is made up from renewables we may replace that capacity but in terms of carbon emissions we will have gone nowhere we must bear that in mindin terms of financing of new generation and the direction of energy policy in this country we are at a crossroads as has been said we want to avoid an over dependence on any one form of energy including nuclear coal and gas if that gas must come not only from norway but all the way from russia as has been said we are at the end of a very long pipeline with all the implications that go with it we might ask the people would you like to be dependent on imported gas from countries such as russia as for honouring commitments by and large it does so but lithuania and belarus might not agree because both have recently had their supplies cut off by russia for political reasons let us bear that in mind were we to ask people whether they wanted to be in that situation in which the vast bulk of our gas was imported they would say no we must think againthe white paper on the back of which this bill has been introduced raises some commendable objectives security of supply reduction in carbon and reduction in the numbers of fuelpoor consumers we would all say that those three are worthy objectives the problem is that they are conflicting they are made more difficult by the changing atmosphere and circumstances in this country i have been in the chamber for the whole debate apart from one speech and i apologise to the hon member for bolton southeast dr iddon for missing his when i nipped out however i caught a news item in which the chief executive of powergen paul golby said that a 20 per cent rise in prices of electricity over the next decade is possible and that a massive amount of investment is needed in the industry\u2014between \u00a350 billion and \u00a370 billion\u2014to secure supply that is an awful lot of money and the suggestion is not from someone who is ignorant of the factsgiven the white paper and the difficulties to which the white paper has perhaps drawn attention without pointing the way to a solution we generally welcome the bill especially as it has been greatly improved as my hon friend the member for eddisbury said by the sterling work carried out in the other place principally by conservative peers although occasionally\u2014i am sure it was a mental aberration\u2014they were supported by the liberal democrats", "i knew that i should not have said that can the hon gentleman be quick as i do not get time added on", "perhaps we will save the details for the committee stagethis debate is taking place in an atmosphere different from the one which would have existed before privatisation great advances have been made in the industry but the whole house would agree that we need to go beyond this bill it is a start and we welcome much that is in it so much so that we will seek to hang on to quite a few of the amendments passed in the other place i do not understand why the government are having such difficulties with the amendments on combined heat and power for instance when i met representatives of the combined heat and power association recently i was told that it had generating capacity that was not being usedthere is an interesting amendment concerning micropower and as the hon member for crewe and nantwich mrs dunwoody pointed out there are navigation amendments there is also a biofuels amendment we shall look at all those closely because we think that they improve what was rather a bland billthe secretary of state said that clause 1 which began as an amendment was superfluous it relates to the security of supply we look forward to seeing how the government manage to wriggle out of their duties in that regardunfortunately in this industry we do not have the free market that everyone assumes or claims that we have perhaps the minister will tell us what will happen to british energy when the nda is established is it intended that the nda will take over some of british energys liabilities if so will the minister tell us whether he has taken legal advice from the european union i understand that a recent report\u2014it may have been published only yesterday\u2014suggested that such intervention might infringe eu rules i do not say that to be awkward i feel that it should be considered although we support the establishment of the ndawe have heard a great deal about two aspects of electricity generation one is wind\u2014there has been a lot of hot air about that\u2014and the other is the nuclear industry i do not want to spend too much time discussing those two issues but i should point out that we are not for or against one form of energy or another what we are in favour of is security of supplyat present 22 per cent of our countrys electricity is generated from renewable sources if that is to be allowed to decline it is up to the government of the day to tell us where they will find the extra electricity to replace it are we to have wind farms or windmills all over the country they are intermittent and building and maintaining them will be costly thankfully they will not need to be maintained for very long because they do not last for more than about 20 years given those factors and the cost of the electricity they will produce it will be up to the government of the day to explain why so much energy is being focused on the development of wind power to the exclusion\u2014seemingly\u2014of other forms of renewable energy such as thermal and solar power and possibly fusion\u2014my hon friend the member for eddisbury mentioned that possibilityit has been a privilege to take part in such an interesting and crucial debate i hope that the minister will answer some of my questions and more important the many questions asked by members in all parts of the house and representing every possible energy interest", "i have tried to resist intervening on this topic but i must point out that no government would write a cheque for the building of new nuclear power stations we believe in the market and it would be up to the market our point is that it is up to the minister to create the economic conditions that will encourage investment to achieve security of supply the coal industry is under environmental threat gas will have to be imported from long distances and we struggle to meet renewables targets so it is up to the government to say how security of supply will be achieved", "no matter how much is put into wind power it will provide electricity only for a small percentage\u2014perhaps only 30 per cent\u2014of the time that is the difference the nuclear industry provides 22 per cent of all our electricity without failing us at all", " indicated dissent", "will the hon gentleman give way",

warning people of the dangers of debt we warn people about drinking smoking and gambling although borrowing can be used for good it is also terrible to be in debt when one does not have the ability to

for dumbarton mr mcfall not only for the way he introduced the subject but for the work that he and his committee have done in producing what i found to be an extremely interesting and informative report it is a pleasure to take part in the debatein a free society borrowing is a useful and necessary tool it finances homes cars businesses and therefore jobs and can help people through hard times in a free society there is a right to borrow money however i qualify that by saying that whether borrowing is good or bad depends on the need to borrow and the reasons for doing so my grandfather always used to tell me when you are in debt you are in danger that is a truism although i stress that in many cases sensible borrowing can be productivewe have heard that the level of debt is perhaps not as important because of low interest rates but we have also heard that some people are paying high interest rates it has been said that about 7 per cent of people may be considered to be highly indebted but a report in the financial times this morning suggested that the figure may be only half that i am concerned by those figures and there has been no attempt today to play down the seriousness of the problemin a typically enlightened and deepthinking speech the hon member for stroud mr drew referred to the fact that people who cannot afford debt may be becoming more indebted from my understanding of the report there was a slight increase between 1995 and 2000 in unsecured debt as a percentage of income for those earning more than \u00a350000 a year however for people earning less than \u00a311500 that debt doubled that is a worrying trend perhaps more worrying is the fact that unsecured debt as a percentage of income for the over65s has almost doubled i understand from work done by my researcher that a quarter of people who go to citizens advice bureaux about debt have also seen their doctors about the problems that debt has created in their lives that is a big problemthere are good and bad reasons to borrow it can seem okay to borrow money if one is earning but the problems arise when circumstances change i do not have a credit card i use charge cards that is primarily because i do not trust myself with credit cards\u2014i would rather have a card that compels me to pay the amount off the next month frightening though that sometimes is i have been in a position in which i was not deeply in debt but had debts to the point that when i received my pay cheque each month it was disheartening to think how much of it had already been spent that is not a good feelingthe vulnerable such as the lowpaid and pensioners are most at risk because they have less chance to pay the money back especially when things go wrong perhaps those categories of people are less able to understand the complexities of the market some of them might be more vulnerable because they cannot get what might be termed respectable credit and therefore go to people offering high interest rate charges or loan sharks that aspect of the economy is a massively complicated subjecta few months ago i decided to buy a new car i had agreed everything but when i went to pick it up the salesman told me to sign a fiveyear agreement i said hang on a minute i dont want a fiveyear agreement i thought it was a threeyear agreement he said oh no this is five years so i said well thanks very much i am going to do some shopping i got a phone call shortly after that\u2014they were evidently panicking that they would lose my custom\u2014saying we have found another way around it you can cut the agreement off after half if you have paid half the amount owing you can hand the car back and there is nothing more to pay i like most people was not aware of that arrangement and the chap trying to sell me the car said that he was not aware of it my point is that the market is so complex that people especially those in the vulnerable groups may not understand that there are choices although their choice could save or lose them thousands of poundswe have become accustomed to not concerning ourselves too much with the interest rates and bank charges that we pay it is so easy to forget how much we are paying hon members may remember that quite a while ago there was an advert for a bank\u2014i cannot remember which\u2014in which someone on the high street asks for change for a pound and is given 90p the advert then shows the people arguing about the remaining 10p the point that the bank was trying to make was that people will argue over the 10p but they will pay charges without realising that they are doing so to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year that was a powerful pointwho can wonder that we get into so much debt when invitations to borrow money come to our house practically every day we can borrow through loans credit cards store cards or overdrafts we may even get letters saying that we have won prizes and it is only when we try to claim them that we find we have to spend money to do soanother thing that has caused debt to grow is the easy availability of not only mortgages but remortgages when we get to the end of a fiveyear deal\u2014and it may have been a good deal\u2014we may remortgage say someone borrows \u00a3100000 or more for a house after five years when changing that mortgage they might borrow \u00a3110000 just to splash out on a holiday or something it is very easy to accumulate debt in that way the fact that there are so many mortgages available and that there are so many options for the consumer is great it must be it is about choice and availability however there is a slight downside to that as i have just describedanother issue that bothers me is interest rates about which we have heard so much the apr almost seems\u2014no is\u2014an irrelevance because it can be calculated in different ways it is totally misleading there are many other misleading things such as store cards when people take out a store card they get a discount on what they buy the next time they go to the shop but they also get hefty interest to pay unless they pay up fronti am concerned about the proliferation of unnecessary credit although i accept that in a free society people are free to borrow money if they want to the increasing levels of credit and debt are not necessarily good it seems that we are able to borrow ever more money without there being a relationship between what we borrow and our ability to pay many hon members talk about the council tax being unfair because it does not relate to ability to pay and that may well be a solid argument but it seems that these days the credit industry does not take account of that ability eithera friend of mine was working fulltime and had a certain credit limit he was then made redundant the credit company was not to know that and upped his credit limit then he got another job and it managed to up his credit limit again then he went parttime and it was upped again he retired and the company upped it again there was absolutely no correlation between his ability to pay and what he was allowed to borrowi understand that someone who has never borrowed money may sometimes find it difficult to do so because they do not have a good credit record of course they do not have a bad credit record either that seems a strange way of running the industryone or two hon members have touched on the insurance charges paid by those unlucky enough to have credit cards\u2014as i say i do not i got a letter on that subject from a constituent this week i know that many people pay insurance and are not quite sure what it is for when they are made redundant they find that they are not covered by the insurance that they paid for and they cannot get that money back that needs to be looked into tooalso money that goes into paying off loans and credit is not being put into savings what worries me as well as the increasing debt is the reduced levels of savings that cannot be a way to ensure security as people get older i am also bothered by the lack of checks a point that the hon member for stroud touched on the sale of goods process is protected in so many ways quite rightly there are regular inspections of schools and factories and nowadays there are inspections of other financial services there has been quite a clampdown in many waysthe fact that a loan is an invisible product should not mean that it is not subject to the law and to checks to ensure that its sale is being carried out in the right way it is because loans are invisible so to speak that they seem to escape the kind of rigorous attention that is needed i do not want to keep quoting the hon gentleman although he is my neighbour in gloucestershire\u2014i will probably feature in the local newspapers more than he if i keep quoting him\u2014but he was absolutely right when he talked about the lack of a personal touchi cannot phone my bank now if i try to do so i have no idea where the person i am speaking to is they may not even be in this country i say nothing against the service that that person may offer regardless of what country they are in however it used to be nice to phone the bank and speak to somebody who knew a little bit about my account and my record that service is just not available now and we should regret that i am sure that it has added to the problems that we now findwhere does that leave us where do we go i do not know whether i should say this but i do not know whether i envy the minister his role because this issue is so difficult to sort out we have a challenge we have the freedom to borrow and as i said if borrowing finances the right things it can be a good thing we have to be free to borrow i have to be free to go to a bank and if the bank wants to do business with me it is free to lend me the money i believe in freedom that is why i joined the conservative party i believe in extending the freedom of the individual to do basically as he pleases as long as that does not interfere with or damage other peoplehowever against that is the need to protect people not just from themselves but from people who might rip them off that is the difficult balance that has to be struck i do not think that the minister has an easy job i am sure that he is up to it but i do not envy him it the best thing that he could do\u2014and again my thunder has been stolen by previous speakers\u2014is to promote education to start teaching people what the issue is all about there are probably two ways in which we can do thati engage in consuming alcohol in smoking and in gambling and i have no intention of giving up any of them however there are constant warnings about the dangers of those three things there are helplines and all sorts of things that warn us against doing them however there do not seem to be the same sort of warnings against getting into debt and that is something that we should think aboutas has been mentioned these days school does not seem to teach the practicalities of life it probably never has we do not seem to teach people the things that they need to know i am not knocking the teaching of arabic or anything else but i think that as a country with a state education system we ought to make sure that school prepares people for the outside world i always thought that it was meant to do that but it does not at all and it needs to startthere are dangers now in the world which did not exist many years ago so there is a great need to teach people about them and about the opportunities that borrowing affords i hope that we can move towards that that is not the entire answer but i believe that it is a start", "to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland pursuant to his answer of 17

at that time i thought that it was one sport governed by one body and absolutely rolling in money i had that impression for some years until i was elected to this house in 1997 since when i have had the honour of representing the tewkesbury constituency which contains cheltenham race course in january 1998 i applied for and obtained an adjournment debate on national hunt racing it is not an exaggeration to say that that debate changed my life because when it was discovered that i had obtained it i was approached by people from absolutely every corner of the sport it was unbelievable that so many people should be phoning me writing to me coming to see me and which was very pleasurable inviting me to their race courses the reason had nothing to do with me those people were desperate for someone to champion their cause i was aware that other hon members who had been here for some years had done that but the fact that someone else who wanted to champion the cause of racing had come to the house was to those people to be hugely welcomedi then began to look into the industry and i discovered two things first it was very fragmented secondly it was not rolling in money as i had thought we hear about racing being the sport of kings which indeed it is but it is also the sport of many ordinary people and long may it continue to be so it is not rolling in money in the way in which some people not associated with the sport might imaginethe reason for my long preamble which will probably be longer than the rest of my speech is that i want to make the point that now is a very uncertain time in horseracing we have heard about the potential collapse of the attheraces deal which has made for much uncertainty the possible changes that the office of fair trading is promoting are also very worrying that was the subject of another adjournment debate that i had the privilege of holding cheltenham in my view is the greatest race course in the world and very successful but it is not the likes of cheltenham that are likely to be much threatened by the ofts proposals i held that debate to demonstrate my concern for the smaller race courses which depend for their income on newer or smaller trainers\u2014people who are starting out in the industry without the herefords and ludlows of this world there would not be a cheltenham so although it is my job to represent the cheltenham race course in the house i am also very concerned about the possible effect of the ofts recommendations on smaller race coursesthere is a problem with income and with potential income and i want to reinforce what my hon friend the member for southeast cambridgeshire said given the current huge uncertainty in racing not only over who controls it\u2014which is being questioned\u2014but over the financial side is this the time for the minister to bind his hands by abolishing the levy without there being any obvious alternative income stream i welcome the bill and the minister has by and large done a very good job but he seems prepared to have his hands bound over one or two aspects yet not over others perhaps we can touch on the matter again on third reading but i support my hon friend in asking the minister to reconsider this aspect given the tremendous uncertainty in horseracing at the moment", "my hon friend has greater experience of these matters than me\u2014generally\u2014so he will know that that does not just happen at a poorly attended dog track it can also happen at a fairly poorly attended horserace meeting", "i support the amendment moved by my hon friend the member for southeast cambridgeshire mr paice the purpose of the bill is not to nationalise the tote but to privatise it or change its status it is rather odd that that objective is not in the bill the bill deals with the nationalisation of the tote which is not the objectiveas we know the tote was set up in the 1920s for the purpose of racing that is why a racing trust as opposed to any other form of trust has been set up of course the tote takes bets on all manner of sports but a racing trust has been set up because the tote was set up for the benefit of racing the tote is not just any old bookmaker other bookies also put money into racing but the totes profits go into racing as well as the sponsorship that it puts in it is therefore a national institution it has run the exclusive pool betting licence for the benefit of racing and for the benefit of the punters one pool as opposed to several pools means that if the punter is fortunate enough to win they get a bigger prize than if there were many different poolsa sale to any body other than one set up purely to benefit racing would be wrong and would miss the point of the bill in a brief speech the hon member for banff and buchan mr salmond described racings uncertain finances for example there is the change in the attheraces deal we have uncertainty with regard to the future of the levy board and the oft creates great uncertainty everywhere it treads the last thing that racing needs at the moment is the possibility albeit small and albeit inadvertent of any further loss of income if the tote sale does not go to the racing trust as we all intend and as i am sure the government intendgiven all that i am left wondering why the amendment is not already in the bill and why it is unacceptable to the government i cannot foresee circumstances unless they are brought about by the heavy hand of the treasury whereby the amendment should not be included in the bill i hope that when the minister replies he will tell us why it cannot be agreed to and under what circumstances he could envisage selling the tote to a body other than an organisation set up exclusively for the benefit of racing", "to ask the secretary

a bit of a paradox there i understand that they get quite a bit of that money from donor countries but i further understand from a written answer that the chancellor gave me a few days ago that there is a shortage of supply in the money coming from those donor countries what can he do to increase that supply", "i congratulate the hon member for doncaster north mr hughes on securing this debate and on speaking so eloquently on behalf of not only hatfield colliery but the uk coal industry i welcome the chance to contribute to the debate i intend to say a few words but to leave the minister plenty of opportunity to reply to a number of the points that have been made by all the hon members who have spoken in some ways i feel a little sorry for the minister because he is perhaps a bit isolated on the issue inasmuch as there seems to be some concern\u2014as expressed not only in this chamber today but throughout the industry\u2014not about the white papers objectives which we all share but about the lack of direction that i am afraid it seems to show i shall return to that in a minutei have researched hatfield colliery and very interesting reading my brief on it is i do not intend to go through that brief because the hon member for doncaster north has indeed spoken about the colliery and i would not pretend to have anything like his knowledge but i know that the colliery has an interesting history and potentially an interesting future which depends on which way this country decides to go in its energy policywhen i took on the shadow department of trade and industry brief some six months ago i started to look at the issues and it became very clear to me that there was no immediate threat to or problem with the security of supply of course we had some technical problems in london and the west midlands when the power was out for nothing more than a few minutes however those technical problems were in no way related to capacity and were nothing to do with supply and it is unfortunate that the two issues got confusedi am satisfied that in the very short term\u2014this year next year\u2014there is enough capacity to see us through that is a dangerous thing to say when we are not yet quite through the winter but i am assured by those at ofgem and many other people that there is sufficient capacity now and indeed there probably will be for next winter however when we look slightly beyond that the situation possibly changes i share the concern that has been expressed not only by a number of hon members but by people throughout the energy world who seem to be somewhat concerned about the prospect of a possible shortage of supply in the medium termwhat do we mean by the medium term well according to one or two discussions that i had only yesterday with people in the industry who really should know they are concerned not about next winter particularly but the winter after that when demand might possibly begin to exceed supply things can be done to secure that supply in the short to medium term but when we move into the middlemedium term things look a little bit worryingas the hon member for normanton mr obrien has already suggested our current mix is about 22 or 23 per cent nuclear about 32 per cent coal and about 38 or 39 per cent gas with one or two other bits coming in that kind of mix\u2014a third a third a third with a desire to increase renewables\u2014is probably not a bad one but that is of course about to change as there are questions about the future of the nuclear industry i want the government to give some signs about what will happen to the nuclear industry which ought to have a futurei accept that the costs in the past cannot be repeated in the future but there is no need for that to happen there is new technology and there are different ways to do things and to handle the waste i have travelled to finland\u2014a country that is expanding its nuclear industry and indeed finding good safe and not all that expensive ways to handle and deal with the waste i think that the nuclear industry has a future but i am not sure that the government agree and i should like the minister to tell us\u2014although i have heard him speak about this before\u2014about his view of the nuclear industrys future as things stand i do not believe that the government particularly intend the nuclear industry to have a futureif the 22 or 23 per cent of electricity produced by the nuclear industry starts to fall how will we make up the difference well let us look at the coal industry which as hon members have suggested is under some environmental pressure in respect of sulphur emissions and carbon emissions\u2014a double whammy that is a threat to the coal industry and we have to recognise it as such of course we have to play our part in reducing emissions but we ought to remember that the emissions produced in this country amount to about 2 per cent of world emissions although we probably have to play more than our part\u2014that would only be fair\u2014i do not want british industry to be penalised to the extent that we have a power supply crisisif the nuclear industry is allowed to diminish and coal is under environmental pressure so that 32 per cent might drop what will happen where will our power come from well we have gas as the hon member for doncaster north and other hon members have said we are due to become a net importer of gas in 2006 the minister confirmed that in the house only a few days ago therefore the 38 or 39 per cent of supply that is now provided by gas might creep up to 49 59 69 or even 79 per cent a lot of that gas will be imported as we have heardi am not convinced that the government have sufficiently advanced the negotiations with countries such as russia algeria and others to enable us to feel secure in the supply of gas which is so important yes a treaty has already been signed with norway but that will cover only a fraction of the gas that we will need to import as we move forward so where will the security of supply come fromi am concerned about the fact that we could become overdependent on gas we have been overdependent on middle east oil in the past\u2014we have seen where that gets us\u2014and to an extent we have been overdependent on coal at certain times which was not a good situation either what i should like is a balanced energy policy so that we are not overdependent on any one source but the government have not yet come up with such a policy they have given no guarantee that they know how to achieve that nor even that it is their desireof course we have the prospect of increasing our use of renewables everyone who cares about the planet and our ability to continue to generate electricity wants renewables to succeed and increase in importance however our targets of 104 per cent of supply by 2010 154 per cent by 2015 and 20 per cent by 2020 seem ambitious when we consider that the present target which is underpinned by an obligation is only 3 per cent even that target has not been met\u2014i think that last years figure was 18 per cent we are not near achieving even a low 3 per cent target so how will we reach 104 per cent in only six or seven yearsi am worried that the government not only expect renewables to come up to the 10 15 and 20 per cent targets but expect windmills to provide all that energy i am in favour of renewables and although i am not against windmills as such we should consider how unreliable and inefficient they are they are expensive to build they do not last long after they are built the electricity that they produce is expensive and no one wants windmills to be built near them so there is a bit of a problem i encourage the government to try to increase the amount of electricity generated by renewable energy and to look a little wider than simply getting that from windmillsi want to leave the minister plenty of time to reply to the many points made by hon members i once again congratulate the hon member for doncaster north on not only raising the issue of hatfield colliery but giving us the opportunity to discuss energy policy in general", "if he will

will need oneis the minister not concerned that because of that situation we will become overreliant on imported gas is he concerned that the government have not investigated the possibilities of gas

referred and who might be called the underclass\u2014that is an unfortunate term but i cannot think of a better way to put it they have been excluded from so much in society and that starts when they leave school without a proper education as many as one in three may leave primary school with a low standard of literacy and numeracy and that continues into secondary school according to my research about 33000 children leave secondary school with no gcses at all i started by saying that qualifications are not everything but we need to ensure that people leave school with an acceptable degree of literacy and numeracy if they do not we will find if we fast forward a few years that between 50 and 60 per cent of the prison population are still illiterate or innumerate or have very low literacy or numeracy standardsfor the record i am not saying that having no education is an excuse for crime\u2014of course many people with poor education do not commit any crime\u2014nor that punishments for people with no education who commit crime should be less severe than those for anybody else a lack of education is not an excuse for committing crime but it might be a reason for it and we must address thatas the hon member for southport said it is not only a lack of education that leads to crime or to poor behaviour in schools much of it is brought about by changes in society an increasing lack of respect for authority naturally leads to a lack of respect for teachers and an unruly classroom at one time\u2014i accept that it was quite a few years ago\u2014large classes sizes were never a problem and classes of 45 to 50 were not at all unusual they were manageable because there was greater discipline in schools and i suspect in the home nowadays such class sizes would be unacceptable and unimaginable\u2014not only because of the educational problems and challenges that would be created but because of behavioural problems assaults on teachers were once relatively unheard of but are now so commonplace that they go almost unreported in the media according to a recent parliamentary answer in the last year for which figures are available 110 assaults that the health and safety executive describes as serious\u2014that is resulting in the teacher taking more than three days off work to recover\u2014were committed that is a frightening statisticthat change in societys attitudes has led to a great deal of truancy\u2014or bunkingoff as my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale mr collins described it that means that children miss lessons reducing their ability to learn and taking them on the downward spiral that might be an excuse or a reason for them to commit crime whether they truant because they are being bullied or are disengaged with what is going on at school or are bored\u2014they are not necessarily stupid but may be quite bright\u2014the common factor is that they can see no point in school far too many parents these days feel the same and some cause a great deal of disruption by taking their children away on unnecessary holidays during termtime that is not helpful but perhaps it suggests the lack of respect for authority that is prevalent in society todayi appreciate that i am about to tread on dangerous ground but a reason for lack of respect was brought home to me at the school where i was chairman of governors i hope that my remarks will be taken in the spirit in which they are meant fiftyfour per cent of the schools population were muslim and the attitude was different all the children in that population had a stable family background yet in one class every child from the indigenous population came from a broken home i do not want to make moral judgments other than to say that that cannot help behaviour and discipline", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for that helpful intervention i suspect that the two points are closely linked the net result of lack of respect for authority and lack of discipline is bullying truancy and expulsions they are big problems in schools but in many cases they are symptoms of bigger ones i stress that every school must have the right to exclude but we must be careful about our treatment of those who are excluded where do they go and what do they do if we are not careful we shall make matters worsei want to consider further the reason for exclusion which is often unmet special educational needs i have often spoken about that subject in the house i make no apology for that and i hope that i shall have the opportunity to speak about it many more times my research demonstrates that unmet special educational needs are a major source of exclusion the independent panel for special education advice reports that 3000 new cases a year are referred to it and 20 per cent relate to pupils who are excluded or threatened with exclusion largely because their needs are not fulfilledthe needs are often not fulfilled because they are not recognised dyslexia and dyspraxia are hard to detect partly because they are often found in bright pupils yet because the problems are not detected sufficiently early the pupils are perceived to be rather dim that is unfair because the reverse is the case the national autistic society says that children with autism or aspergers syndrome are 20 times more likely to be excluded than pupils without special educational needsi served on the committee that considered the special educational needs and disability bill which was designed to promote inclusion i readily accept that many pupils with special educational needs are rightly included in mainstream schools because we cannot categorise people as normal or not normal however that is not right for all children and it is dangerous to make inclusion a partypolitical issue in gloucestershire that appears to have happenedthe liberal democratlabourcontrolled county council appears determined to close the special schools in gloucestershire it has started by closing bownham park school in stroud and it is targeting alderman knight school in my constituency i fear that the county council is using the special educational needs and disability act 2001 as an excuse to save money that must be unacceptable alderman knight school is under threatexclusion from the activities of an inappropriate mainstream school can lead to exclusion in later life although attendance at a mainstream school does not itself ensure inclusion mainstream schools cannot always provide the care and education required by children with special needs whereas special schools often can do so the children in question do not always suffer from educational behavioural or learning difficulties\u2014which are bad enough many have physical difficulties as with some pupils at alderman knight if they attend mainstream schools they may become bullies themselves or more likely be bullied because their problems make them stand out they might drop out of school play truant disengage or be disruptive\u2014causing problems for other pupils and teachersmany teachers governors parents and pupils are against the proposed closure of alderman knight school and the forced inappropriate inclusion of some pupils in mainstream schools i believe that the county councils consultation in respect of alderman knight school is something of a sham and that a decision has already been made when i made that claim at a county council meeting last friday nothing that was said convinced me that it was not the case it is a shameful decision anyone who decides to close a special school that is doing so well is blighting the lives of many pupils and denying them the help that they need pupils themselves say that they are having their hopes removed it does not matter what we think the pupils themselves know that they could not cope in a mainstream schooli have invited the minister many times to visit alderman knight school where he will be most welcome i hope that he will at last take me up on that genuine offer the minister is generous enough to acknowledge that the threat to alderman knight is close to my heart i do not want more and more pupils put into inappropriate education to become the problems of the future", "the hon gentleman is right does he agree that it is sad that there is always a long queue of people waiting to go into the strangers gallery because they cannot resist watching that event", "my hon friend touches on an issue close to my heart because the alderman knight special school in my constituency is under threat of closure\u2014for no reason that i can see other than the governments inclusion programme does my hon friend agree that if children are forced to attend mainstream schools that may achieve inclusion but the exclusion of such pupils from many activities because of their lack of ability means that they will lose out", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what plans she has to improve the welfare of racing greyhounds and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will hold a public inquiry into the explosion at cleansing services group sandhurst gloucestershire in october 2000 and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department what plans he has to assist a tobacconists b alcohol retailers and c publicans in determining the age of customers where restrictions on sales exist and if he will make a statement", "i do not have any interests in racing that have to be registered but like many hon members i have a longstanding love of the sport indeed i have a serious constituency interest as prestbury park race course at cheltenham is in my constituency i must correct the hon member for newbury mr rendel\u2014prestbury park is the greatest race course in the world the race course and the activities associated with it have a major knockon effect throughout my constituency and indeed beyond especially in midmarch when the cheltenham festival is held i also have a nonregisterable but nevertheless close relationship with the tote which is partly a matter of friendship and partly a matter of holding a tote credit account like other hon members i am not very successful in my transactions this morning i spoke to a friend who asked me what i was doing today i said ive got the tote bill to which he replied how much is it this timethis is an important time for racing as has been said with the oft investigation to which i shall return in a minute various changes that the british horseracing board is introducing in its racing review the levy board changes and the bill which i shall call the tote bill although i accept that its provisions are much wider however i want to concentrate on the toteit is important to remember the huge contribution that the tote has made to the country generally and to racing in particular it has sponsored the cheltenham gold cup which is probably\u2014again i am being parochial\u2014the greatest steeplechase in the world the tote has as we have heard put millions of pounds into racing and given us many interesting betting products throughout its many shops it has the placepot a popular bet that allows people to win rather a lot of money for a small stake although in my case it is usually a lot of stake for a little return nevertheless people can bet without putting down a great deal of money what is called the sport of kings benefits people at all levels and the tote is a major contributor to racing in that respecti pay tribute to the tote staff particularly the chairman peter jones and roger easterby who is in close contact with many members of parliament to provide a great deal of information not only about the bill but about all the events in racing generally racing would not be the same without the contribution of the tote so it is extremely important that we get the bill rightthis is a crucial time for racing given the importance of the tote to racing we must consider the details of the bill i welcome it and congratulate the minister on introducing it the bill is long awaited many of us who were at the tote annual general meeting quite a few years ago\u2014i do not remember how many\u2014heard the then home secretary now the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs the right hon member for blackburn mr straw announce that the status of the tote would be changedas we have heard there are one or two issues that concern us the first is whom the tote will be sold there is no guarantee about that what guarantee do we have that it will not just be sold to the highest bidder what guarantee do we have that the governments finances at that time which are deteriorating will not dictate that the tote is sold to the highest bidder we are expected to take it on good faith the purpose of the bill is not the nationalisation of the tote but to sell it on yet the only thing certain about the bill is the nationalisation of the tote i do not see why it cannot be written into the bill that it will be sold to a racing trustsecondly how much will the trust if the tote is sold to the trust be charged for the tote the price will determine who buys it\u2014not who wants to buy it but who is able to buy it how will that be decided who will decide it i suppose the minister and the secretary of state will decide how much the trust will be charged for the tote but how will that be decided", "i am certain that the minister will not decide to put that in the bill and announce it today the next stage will be the committee stage and it would give the members of the committee and the whole racing world a great deal of confidence if he would tell us the mechanism for reaching the price if not the price itselfi stress that no government have ever put a single penny into the tote and i am not saying they should the government cannot expect any receipts from the tote as has already been said every penny the government charge for the tote will come out of racing there is nowhere else that it can come from so we will end up with a ridiculous situation where the tote puts its profits into racing and the government take those profits out there is no other way of looking at it it is as simple as thatpart of the mechanism i suppose will be the exclusive licence it is extremely important to the tote and to racing the national lottery has been a success most probably because of the large prizes that can be won\u2014again for very little money that is how the pool operates in so much as people can win quite a bit of money for a very little stake as i have said i do not think that the national lottery would be successful if it were broken down into any number of smaller lotteries and not only the tote but other bookmakers recognise that i do not know whether it is widely understood\u2014in this house it will be\u2014but they can tap into the placepot bet for example which thus makes it less of a monopoly the sevenyear period seems to be accepted throughout the industry but why is that not in the bill the length of the licence equals the value of the tote business which equals the price and all that equals who owns it in the endi want to say a word or two about the levy board not because i want to get involved in the detail of the winding up of the levy and not necessarily replacing it but having welcomed the bill the timing is rather uncertain given the ofts investigation i am sure that i would not be allowed to proceed too far down the road of discussing the ofts investigation especially as i have held an adjournment debate in the house to discuss that but this is an uncertain time for the racing industry and the ofts timing is rather bad in so much as the industry is trying to improve itself as i have already mentioned the british horseracing board already has its racing review\u2014a root and branch look at racing it accepts that improvements have to be madeto repeat what i said in an intervention it would be rather curious for the government to give up control of horseracing as they should only for that control effectively to pass to an unelected unapproachable quango with no interest in racing no responsibility to racing and it seems no accountability to anbody the minister again to give him his credit in a written reply to me has said that he has great concerns about what the oft might come up with the minister for employment relations competition and consumers has said the same so parliament does not seem to have any control over the oft ministers do not seem to have any control over the oft racing certainly does not and we cannot even raise the issue with any great success in this housetherefore we must be extremely careful about what we do to racing we could get it right and we could get it wrong the government are understandably changing the levy system and we could also lose money from racing because of the oft if the government charge too much for the tote money will come out of racing in a third way together all that would have a devastating effect it does not need to be that way we could look at the matter positively and that is the way that i would prefer to look at itwhen the minister replies i hope that he will address the points that not only i have made but that many other hon members have made however in general terms i welcome the bill and i wish it well", "does the right hon gentleman like me find it rather curious that the government quite rightly should want to shed the responsibility of effectively running racing but are we not in effect seeing that responsibility passed to an unelected quango called the oft", "i welcome this long overdue bill but i agree with the right hon member for livingston mr cook that the bill does not guarantee that the tote will be sold to the racing trust the minister says that he cannot foresee any circumstances in which that would not happen but one factor that might prevent such a sale would be if the government asked for too much money no government have ever put money into the tote so this government cannot expect to make too much money from its sale", "if he will introduce legislation to require public utilities to obtain planning permission before erecting masts and if he will make a statement", "i thank the minister for that mildly encouraging response in my constituency network rail planned to build a 33 m mast in the village of churchdown but it withdrew its proposals when all the residents formed a group to oppose them may i suggest that organisations such as network rail invest in investigating what alternative and indeed more advanced technology might be available to avoid siting masts where they are clearly not wanted and where they are clearly inappropriate it might also be better if a formal consultation were required so that residents had the right to prevent such things from happening in the first place", "if he will make a statement on plans to improve rail links between london and gloucestershire", "i thank the minister for that reply although i must say that people in gloucestershire who travel to london might not recognise the improvements he describes i spoke to the strategic rail authority only this morning and it told me that there is no certainty of improved services until 2006 i understand that the sra will not advertise the new franchises until next year yet there is an urgent need to improve rail transport between gloucestershire and london furthermore the link with ashchurch station which opened only recently has been made almost worthless by the reduction in services from that station many people who live in gloucestershire choose to drive to london because of the inadequacy of the rail services", "to ask the secretary of state for transport 1  what discussions he has had with the strategic rail authority regarding possible refurbishment of birmingham new street station and if he will make a statement2  what discussions he has had with network rail regarding possible closures of birmingham new street station

hon member for bradford south mr sutcliffe who has ministerial responsibility for competition have expressed a great deal of concern about what is likely to be proposed the minister said that racing has been doing rather well recently so will he redouble his efforts to convince the oft that the last thing that it needs at the moment is for the baby to be thrown out with the bath water the racing industry is improving and making plans for the future the last thing that it needs is a heavyhanded report from the oft", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what

rather a coincidence that i am following the hon member for northeast derbyshire mr barnes because i want to raise a similar issue it relates to a company called cleansing services group which operated\u2014i use the past tense thank goodness\u2014in the village of sandhurst in my constituency three years ago an explosion happened at the works which was a chemical works although it was not authorised to be so it had planning permission from the county council to treat oily waste and such substances yet the environment agency gave it a licence to deal with much more hazardous waste even though it had no planning permission for thatmany villagers warned the environment agency other agencies and people that things were not right at the site a whistleblower was sacked for various reasons and won his case at the industrial tribunal i visited several times and warned the agencies they took some notice but not enough three years ago the place exploded the effects on peoples mental and physical health are difficult to measure i shall not go into the same amount of detail as the hon member for northeast derbyshire because i want to cover one or two other issues and i have raised the matter previouslythe pressure from villagers has driven the company off the site and that might offer some encouragement to the hon member for northeast derbyshire it decided that the best way in which to proceed was to sell the site and we are all thankful for that however the pain misery and effects of the explosion persisti want a public inquiry to look not only into that incident and into the company although those aspects should certainly form part of its terms of reference but into the way in which the environment agency the health and safety executive the county council and to an extent the health authority were monitoring the site they were given many warnings about it and apparently visited it a number of times yet they were unable or unwilling to take the necessary action such a public inquiry might determine that those bodies did not have enough power to take the action that we felt necessary although i do not think that that would be the casemy constituents like everyone else pay an awful lot of tax\u2014an increasing amount sadly under this government but that is not my main point\u2014to fund those agencies on whom they rely to look after their health and the environment that is the agencies job yet in this case they have signally failed to do it to bring justice to my constituents who live in the village of sandhurst and perhaps more importantly to avoid similar situations arising in the future there should be a public inquiry into the performance of the agencies that were supposed to be monitoring that sitethe deputy prime minister and the former minister for the environment the right hon member for oldham west and royton mr meacher were very generous with their time shortly after the explosion they had a number of meetings with me and said that they would consider holding a public inquiry first however they wanted to see whether there would be a court case against the company it was in fact taken to court and a week or two ago was fined \u00a3250000 and ordered to pay \u00a3400000 costs it deserves to pay at least that my point is that that court case is now out of the way so the government could decide to hold a public inquiry into what went on when cleansing services group was not being monitored properly and when the explosion happened causing so many problems for my constituentsthat company is known as csg i now want to move on to sen which stands for special educational needs i have raised this subject many times in the house in an adjournment debate and on other occasions it is a big issue in gloucestershire the county council there is run by an unholy liblab pact\u2014i make that point only so that it is clearly understood it is not a party political point\u2014which has a policy of questioning the viability of the special schools in the area it seems to want to close them all downa few years ago i served on the standing committee that considered the special educational needs and disability bill which was meant to provide for greater inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream schools i was assured by the minister at the time that it should not be seen as giving a green light for the wholesale closure of special schools i think that those are pretty close to the ministers words in gloucestershire however it has had the effect of giving that green light and the county council is trying to bring about such a wholesale closurethe bownham park special school in stroud has been closed and i understand that two schools in the forest of dean have been closed although they are to be put on the site of a new school that has still had the effect of merging two schools into one however the general drift in the county is towards the closure of special schools there is a very good special school in my constituency called alderman knight school whose future is currently out to public consultation given the previous actions of the county council we know what its desires and intentions arei have asked many times for the secretary of state to visit alderman knight school i promise that he would be made very welcome there i want him to listen not just to the politicians but to the teachers and the head teachers of the mainstream and special schools who are all saying the same thing nor do i want him to listen only to the parents i want him to listen to the pupils i want him to stand in front of them as i have done when they break down in tears and speak of their fears of being forced to go to a mainstream school listen to the pupils not me\u2014it does not matter what i think listen to their fears if all the special schools are closed where is the choice it is of course a fact that many pupils with special educational needs go to mainstream schools and do very well which should continue my only point is that that is not right for all pupils if those schools close these pupils will have no optionthe governments intention may be inclusion\u2014i do not generally dispute that\u2014but those pupils will not be included in future life they will be excluded from society because they will not have had the care and education that they need as special cases they will not cope in mainstream schools and they will therefore be excluded from society in future life i ask the minister to come to gloucestershire and see what is going on he should look those children in the eye and tell me whether he agrees with it i do not think he willwe have had csg and sen now i want to discuss the oft the office of fair trading is another subject on which i have held an adjournment debate it is carrying out various investigations as hon members know the investigation that particularly concerns me is the one being carried out into horse racing again i have a constituency interest my tewkesbury constituency contains prestbury park which is the cheltenham race course in my view it is the greatest race course in the world i do not necessarily fear for it as much as for the smaller race courses\u2014the herefords the ludlows and the southwells those are feeder tracks where horses jockeys trainers and owners may start their careers they are very important particularly to national hunt racingthe oft is investigating the control of british horse racing and it says that the british horseracing boards control of the fixture list is noncompetitive technically i suppose that the oft might have a point however despite the fact that this industry is always disunited and has more arguments and rows than any other i have ever known the oft has unbelievably managed to bring all the warring factions together in opposition to its plans it may have a point there may be things in british horse racing that need to improve the issue as regards control of the fixture list is not the only one it has identified there is also the sale of data rights to one buyer rather than a number of buyers which we have heard about in relation to bskyb a parallel case has been dealt with in the european union recentlythe oft says that a number of points in british racing have to change the interesting thing is that the british horseracing board\u2014like racing itself\u2014is not denying that it has to make changes it is making changes but we are very concerned that the oft could end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater if it forces those changes through in a heavyhanded waywho says so the industry says so as i do but interestingly the minister for sport and tourism appears to agree with my points as does the undersecretary of state for trade and industry the hon member for bradford south mr sutcliffe the competition minister they have been honest enough to tell me that how can it be that the oft is doing something that the government and the industry do not want it to do somehow it has become so powerful that it can do that against the wishes of the government and the industry surely that cannot be right i know that the competition minister and the sports minister have made their views known to the oft but i hope that the governments representations to it will be powerful enough to persuade the oft not to drop the case entirely but to proceed sensibly and take on board points made to it by the many strands of the racing industrythose are the main issues that i wanted to raise i want to finish on one point i do not want to take up any more time in wishing everyone in the house a happy christmas and a peaceful new year i echo the views expressed perhaps differently by other hon members one of whom was my hon friend the member for uxbridge mr randall many people in this country and throughout the world cannot look forward to a happy christmas because of their personal circumstances a year ago i was in ethiopia and i witnessed the desperate poverty in that country at that time thank the lord things are slightly easier this year but countries such as ethiopia and others in africa that suffer from war poverty and disease can be forgotten when we are concentrating perhaps rightly on iraq or on the muddle in europe over attempts to introduce a constitution many important issues may make us forget the plight of the starving people who live only to exist and that of the children who each and every day have to walk miles to another village just to bring water back to their own village that cannot be an acceptable life for anyone when we concentrate on the problems of iraq and the european constitution we should not forget the plight of the third worldmr

of the scale\u2014the provision of special needs education a few years ago i served on the standing committee that considered a bill introduced by the government in relation to special needs education its objective was in the governments words to secure inclusion and enable more children with special needs to attend mainstream schools i was told at the time because i was concerned about the matter that the legislation should in no way lead to the wholesale closure of special schools those exact words were used\u2014it was not a green light for closuremy experience however has been somewhat different in gloucestershire\u2014i must point out not for party political purposes that gloucestershire county council is run by an unholy liblab pact with the conservatives even though they are the largest group completely excluded from the executive\u2014the policy is without doubt to close the special schools in the county one at bonnham park in stroud has already been closed two in the forest of dean are being merged and a school called alderman knight in my constituency near tewkesbury is under threat\u2014there is consultation but there is no doubt that a threat exists to that school in gloucestershire therefore it seems that the ministers words that the policy should not lead to a wholesale closure of special schools are not being heededof course many pupils are included in mainstream schools should be so included and are doing well mainstream schools however are not appropriate for all children with special needs many children who go to alderman knight school are even physically handicapped\u2014they have great difficulties the teachers there know that those pupils could not cope in mainstream schools and their parents know that they could not cope in mainstream schools what is even more important however\u2014it is an emotive issue when it is discussed with them\u2014is that the pupils themselves know that they could not cope in mainstream schools and are fearful of being sent to those schools they have broken down in tears when they have explained the situation to me one or two have even been brave enough to attend public meetings to speak against forced inclusion", "i did not imply that there was to be a loss of provision i said that schools were merging i am sure the hon lady is not suggesting that special needs education in gloucestershire is being downgraded she must accept however that people would not go on marches come to the house or sign petitions if they did not believe that the special school of alderman knight was under threatthere is a great danger that those special needs children will be forced into mainstream schools against their will that does not suit them or the pupils and teachers at mainstream schools again hon members do not have to take my word for it they should talk to them as i have done my opinion does not matter what matters is what the pupils teachers and parents think if pupils are forced to go to schools where they cannot cope their right to a good education will have been removed we call it inclusion but they will not be included in society if they do not have the appropriate education or the appropriate care which they can receive only at special schoolswhat is the choice for parents if those schools are closed if they do not have the option of sending their children to them they will have to send them to a mainstream school that is no choice why are the changes being made is it because of party political dogma or for financial reasons in gloucestershire it is both there is party political dogma\u2014there is no question about it\u2014but there is also the problem of financesthe county council is thinking of changing sixthform provision in the city of gloucester and its outskirts some of which also fall into my constituency are those changes motivated by financial constraints we keep hearing from the government that more and more money is going into education yet i find that special schools and sixth forms are under threat one of the wards at tewkesbury hospital was also under threat again because of money yet we are told that the health service is receiving more money where is it all goingi do not want to dwell on finance however if the minister doubts my word he should come to alderman knight school it would be delighted to receive him he should look those children in the eye and tell them that he supports proposals to close their school i do not think he would do that i certainly hope that he would noton topup fees if anyone is advising a couple who are about to get married\u2014although it is probably unwise to do so\u2014the advice should be to avoid debt my grandfather had a saying when you are in debt you are in danger we should not be sending graduates out into the world of work with massive debts hanging around their necks we hear that they are likely to earn much more money because they have university degrees something that i do not own however hon members have missed the point if graduates earn more money they will pay more tax because it is a percentage of our income that seems very simple to mei am proud that i was part of the education team that decided that the conservatives would scrap tuition fees when we returned to government nothing in our policy would prevent students from going to university as has been suggested our aim is to stop what was graphically and well described by the hon member for barnsley central mr illsley as the circle whereby many people go to university but some cannot get a job on leaving and do jobs that do not require degrees yet this country has a skills shortage many people drop out of university because they took the wrong course and we have a massive bill that we cannot pay why not reduce the bill when i speak to representatives of industry in my constituency and to health service workers i hear about the skills shortage but sending more people to university will not redress that shortage if it could the skills gap would not existit was a conservative government who increased the number of students going to university from one in eight to one in three perhaps we should now consider educating and training people in a different and more appropriate way i would have liked to speak further about that issue but i fear i have run out of time", "it is essential that

of trade and industry minister part of my responsibility is for competition and consumers but i am holding this debate as the member of parliament whose constituency contains the cheltenham race course at prestbury park which many people rightly consider to be the greatest race course in the world although i have not yet seen all of them", "my hon friend obviously disputes my opinioni have also been a follower of the sport of racing particularly national hunt racing for more than 20 years so i have a personal interest in the matter having said that i do not have a vested interest in it in that i am not involved in any one aspect of the sport for example i am not an owner trainer or breeder or anything similar i am just someone who loves the sport and who enjoys the odd flutter when i have time although not usually too successfully the point is that i come to the debate as a neutralthe debate is urgent and extremely important to the sport of horse racing because the oft has issued a preliminary notice that it believes that there are unacceptable restrictions on competition caused by the central control of the fixture list by the british horseracing board by the central selling of data regarding details of races by that body and by the setting of rules and orders by the jockey clubit is a sad fact that the many factions in racing\u2014the breeders owners jockeys stable staff trainers bookmakers race courses and so on\u2014represent warring factions the industry is well known for that in fact the former home office minister the hon member for knowsley north and sefton east mr howarth who used to have responsibility for much of racing once said to me laurence for all my experience of dealing with militant in liverpool none of it prepared me for the racing world i think we all know what he meantit must be said however that the ofts preliminary ruling has served to unite almost the entire racing fraternity in opposition to its plans even the minister for sport is concerned about its proposals in a letter to me dated 29 august he wrotei share your view that full implementation of the ofts rulings as far as we understand them may damage the fabric or integrity of the sportthat is a profound statement from the ministerso why is the oft making these recommendations and why is it looking into what is essentially a sport in the first place its concern should surely be for the consumer yet in the last 10 years attendance at race courses has increased by 21 per cent the consumers of this sport do not seem to be unduly worried about the way in which horse racing is run in the same 10year period the amount of prize money has increased by 64 per cent the number of runners by 20 per cent the number of horses in training by 19 per cent the number of owners by 8 per cent the number or races by 7 per cent and the number of fixtures by 4 per cent those figures do not point to a sport that is in crisis or being badly or fairly managed quite the reverseeven more important than those figures is the fact that british horse racing has integrity the latest row in horse racing\u2014i have to say that there are more rows in racing than there are rebellions in new labour\u2014is over whether jockeys should be allowed to use mobile phones i will not get into that argument other than to say that the jockey clubs proposals may be an indication of how seriously this body takes the issue of integritydoes anyone really believe that rich people from abroad such as the maktoum family would play such a large part in british racing if it did not have integrity would such people engage in a sport that was fragmented as the oft seems to suggest that it should be at present racing takes place on almost every day of the year and many evenings there are never fewer than two meetings a day and rarely more than four the types of races run are carefully balanced and prize money is systematically and sympathetically distributed that is not just control it is more than that it is coordination\u2014a coordination that attracts many people including people from abroad to the sporteven given that success story however the major players in the sport\u2014especially the organisation charged with coordinating so much in racing the british horseracing board\u2014recognise that many things must change and that further significant improvements must be made that is why the bhb recently conducted a rootandbranch review of racing that recommends many changes as the chairman of the bhb peter savill in his recent agm speech saidthe racing review committee has proposed some significant changes to the racing product and the racing experience which will improve the integrity of the sport establish a true meritocracy strengthen national hunt racing put british breeding on a more level playing field with its irish and french counterparts and increase consumer interest in the sportthat demonstrates that no one in the sport wants to stand still but the oft recommendations threaten to throw the baby out with the bathwater the chaos that would result from the absence of central coordination of the fixture list and an inability to set the rules and orders for the sport centrally could not possibly bring benefits to the consumer it would be quite the reverse in the absence of any ability to bring together the different strands of racing\u2014all the disparate groups i mentioned earlier\u2014and to set rules and impose discipline the integrity of the sport would suffer how can that act as a protection for the consumerthe basis of the ofts preliminary ruling is chapter i of the competition act 1998 which\u2014here i quote from a letter i received from the oft dated 7 august\u2014prohibits agreements that appreciably restrict competition in the uk unless they deliver countervailing economic benefitsi could respond to that in a number of ways first we are talking about a sport no one has to engage in it watch it or bet on it that is all done voluntarily it is not like buying bread milk potatoes or other essentials this is a national sport which should surely be governed by national rules if i watch my home team bolton wanderers play football they will be using the same rules that would be used were i unfortunate enough to have to watch arsenal or leedssecondly does anyone really believe that consumers would like to see not one national sport called horse racing but a number of different race courses all with different rules and standards of discipline with no coordination of the types of races run or horses attracted all\u2014as minnows\u2014having to sell their own picture rights and data rights to the big bad powerful bookmakers are individual race courses or consumers likely to benefit from such a freeforall the chief executive of the racecourse association stephen atkins\u2014whom i met earlier this week\u2014does not think so might not the oft break down the supposed power of the bhb as many people in the sport fear only for that democratic body to be replaced in effect by an undemocratic cartel formed within the bookmaking industryresponsible bookmakers many of whom are good friends of mine do not want the oft investigation to result in chaos indeed a senior executive at ladbrokes told me that recently and it was peter jones the chairman of the tote who helped me to put together this speech i pay tribute the likes of ladbrokes and the tote for sponsoring so many races most famously the tote cheltenham gold cup which takes place in my constituency each yearthirdly such central coordination of fixtures and rules and of the collective selling of data rights therefore delivers the countervailing economic benefits that the oft requires fourthly such central coordination protects the sports integrity which where betting is involved is crucial to its survival and ability to prosper a freeforall in the control of fixtures and rules could not possibly enhance the sports integrity so how could that benefit the consumer whom the oft is supposed to exist to protectas i have said there is total recognition and acceptance throughout the sport that things must change and many proposals are on the table but changes brought about by heavyhanded demands from the oft will seriously weaken rather than strengthen the sport as a consumer product virtually everyone throughout the industry fears for example for the future of national hunt racing if the ofts proposals bring about the freeforall in which they would surely result smaller tracks in particular would suffer such tracks while being valuable sources of great entertainment in themselves are also feeder courses\u2014training courses perhaps\u2014for larger ones such as cheltenham and aintree so could the wrong kind of oftinspired changes to the sport signal the end of the cheltenham gold cup and the grand national and could such changes bring about a shift away from racing on turf and towards racing on sand somehow a dirt track would not fit too comfortably with the dresses and hats at royal ascot it would seem rather incongruous such things are unthinkable but quite possible as is significant damage to the rural economyso what can be done i suggest that the oft treat this investigation very sensitively it should recognise that it is dealing with a sport not a large and dominant business it should recognise that british horse racing is respected and followed throughout the world and it should attempt to understand racings characteristics which play such a vital role in holding the sport together i therefore ask the oft not to make heavyhanded proposals but to recognise the changes already being proposed within the sport itself and to work with its representatives rather than against them only by doing that can consumers be both protected and wellservedi hope that the oft will be sensible but if its final proposals are in the governments view potentially damaging to the sport i ask the minister to use his powers under the 1998 act to intervene clause 33 of the 1998 act statesthe secretary of state may at any time by order amend schedule 3 with respect to the chapter i prohibition by    providing for one or more additional exclusionsi suggest that sport should be such an exclusioni have to make this request of the minister because it is impossible to question or talk to the oft in this chamber it appears to be empowered to make decisions that could have profound effects on a national sport and thereby on many peoples livelihoods without any reference to parliament it is therefore only reasonable for me to ask the minister to intervene if it is likely that the oft will not take a reasonable and sensible approachthere is a precedent for such action for example the secretary of state provided for an exemption for public transport ticketing schemes which came into force on 1 march 2001 furthermore the government are looking sympathetically at the position on the exclusive pool betting licence as operated by the tote quite rightly they are likely to allow the tote to retain it when the organisation is privatised as the government have pledged i applaud the government for their sensitivity in that respect because it is in the interests of racing and the consumer that the tote retains its exclusive pool betting licence\u2014and even other bookmakers agree i am asking the oft to show the same sensitivity and flexibility in dealing with racing as a whole in the absence of such a compromise i ask the minister to exercise his powers as allowed under the 1998 actbritish horse racing is a national sport admired by millions of people in this country and abroad it is part of our heritage last weekend i had the pleasure of attending the 227th running of the st leger at doncaster the traditions of the sport are an integral part of it disraeli once described himself as a progressive conservative and i suggest that evolution not revolution is the way to improve the running integrity and therefore the performance of horse racing to the benefit of all who take part in itthe oft has the responsibility of safeguarding the interests of consumers and i am asking the oft to do precisely that i am also asking the minister to ensure that it is done in such a way that it benefits consumers rather than risk destroying the sport that so many of us love horse racing is the sport of kings but it is also the sport of many ordinary people who are depending on us to get this right", "the minister will be aware of my

congratulate the hon member for ealing north mr pound on reintroducing\u2014i suppose that is the correct term\u2014the bill and on speaking in its favour in such an entertaining but serious manner i thought the balance of his remarks was absolutely correct because this is a very important issue i also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for solihull mr taylor who has been in the chamber for a large part of today for introducing the bill in 2001 he did so because of the great concern that existed and still existsin general the conservative party recognises the problems associated with high hedges as has been said they block out the light and the sun they can harm soil conditions and damage drains and fastgrowing leylandii trees in certain areas can be a particular problem those problems and the resulting disputes between neighbours destroy previously good relations harming the quality of life of people who have been caught up in them the problem seems to have been the lack of a remedy which has caused difficulties to drag on i understand that the hon gentlemans bill is intended to enable local authorities to take remedial action where necessary\u2014that is the point it is important to ensure that action is taken only where necessary as he rightly said the bill does not ban high hedges or tall leylandii trees\u2014i have tall leylandii trees in my garden and i do not think that those will be banned because i have no neighbours i do not think that the legislation would be a problem to me if it became a problem i would take the matter up again with the hon gentleman", "i have neither my hon friends intellect nor eloquence it therefore might be better if i say that in certain cases whether people object to high hedges will depend very much on the people who were displaying themselves in view of the lack of time i will duck his intervention", "my hon friend has made many good and serious points but probably three quarters of tewkesbury lies in builtup areas and i have had many letters from a great many people on this subject i recognise the point that he makes howeverthe nightmare of high hedges has gone on for some years i regret that there has not been government action to tackle it they have made noises the minister for the environment has mentioned it as has the undersecretary apart from publishing the over the garden hedge leaflet in 2002 however we have not seen a great deal of government action in that regard i wonder whether the government intend to take over the bill because the minister said that we should not reach a point at which councils or the courts need to intervene will he clarify their position in his windingup speechseveral hon members especially conservative members expressed concerns about aspects of the bill i shall not repeat them all owing to the shortage of time but i shall highlight one or two we recognise the worries of people who live next door to high hedges however they can protect peoples privacy as we heard people write to hon members saying that they want their windows or gardens to be protected and kept private and high hedges and trees might be the only way to do that we should bear in mind people who live near roads i live near a motorway that can be noisy in certain atmospheric conditions and the trees in my garden protect me from thatwe want to avoid creating excessive bureaucracy for local authorities because they will have to consider complaints issue remedial notices and ensure that people comply with them will they receive proper financial support to enable them to do that the hon member for ealing north referred to clause 21 which relates to financial provisions but it would not guarantee that the government would provide the money necessary to enable local authorities to take on yet another dutywe recognise the problems disputes and misery that are often caused by high hedges and people who suffer must be able to access a legal remedy i hope that the important caveats that my hon friends and i have mentioned will be addressed during later stages of the bill and with that proviso i hope that it receives its second reading", "as the secretary of state knows i led an interparliamentary union trip to ethiopia in december where i saw at first hand the problems created by the drought despite the understandable focus on iraq will she nevertheless assure the house that she will ensure that ethiopia receives all the food aid that it has been promised as quickly as possible", "if he will pay full pensions to people who are in hospital for longer than six weeks and if he will make a statement", "i am grateful to the minister for that response but does he recognise that the problem is bigger when people have to stay in hospital much longer because of bed blocking is it not also a problem that other benefits such as the disability living allowance and the carers allowance make it increasingly difficult for people to leave hospital i welcome the change of the sixweek rule to 13 weeks but will the minister review other benefits and ensure that people are not kept in hospital when they should not be there", "to ask the secretary of

as was the hon member for richmond park dr tonge whose skills extended to treating me when i became rather ill there thanks to her help however i did not miss much of our visiti congratulate the hon member for north norfolk norman lamb on initiating the debate and speaking so knowledgeably on the subject of rwanda and the great lakes i shall confine my remarks to my experience of rwanda the right hon member for coatbridge and chryston covered much of what i wanted to say and i shall not repeat it however he was right to say that although we were aware of what was going on in rwanda the world stood by and watchedi understand people believing that politics is a hypocritical business at the moment we are rightly concentrating on what is happening in iraq after that perhaps we shall consider what is happening in north korea pakistan and iran but we stood by and watched while 850000 people in rwanda were being massacred in the most horrific waywe visited a church in rwanda where people had taken refuge and had literally to walk through piles of skulls and human bones we laid flowers on massive collections of human remains which brought home the horror of the genocide that had taken place only a few years before unlike a previous parliamentary delegation we did not find out more about how those people\u2014men women and children\u2014had been killed however it was the most horrific thing that i have ever seen and i am sure that i shall never experience anything like it againit got worse however as the right hon gentleman said we visited the court and saw what was described as justice on the grass i happened to meet a woman who had lost her father her husband her sister and three children in the massacre her dignity was incredible she told me that she did not want retribution she did not want to see the young man who had just confessed to the crimes being put to death because that would have added to the carnage she wanted justice but also the reconciliation to which people in rwanda now seem committedthe right hon gentleman was right to say that that reconciliation needs the help of the international community although people there are determined on reconciliation because of the horrors that they have experienced the situation in rwanda is fragile indeed as the hon member for north norfolk said that fragility extends to the countries that surround rwanda when we arrived we found that conflict had broken out on rwandas borders albeit briefly which was a reminder of how fragile the situation isthe right hon gentleman graphically analysed what we found in rwanda i shall not repeat what he said but shall finish by saying that although we concentrated on the carnage and the desperate genocide that took place there it is too easy to forget that the country is poor and diseased that it has no infrastructure and that it suffers under european union trade rules we need to address all those issues we should not forget that side of rwandaa short while ago i had the privilege of leading a delegation to ethiopia which is facing drought and the possibility of starvation however people there can survive\u2014they probably will\u2014with the help of the international community in rwanda such help is necessary i support the prime ministers stance against certain countries but i ask the minister to remind him that in addition to the threat from iraq\u2014we must never take our eye off that ball\u2014murders on the most massive scale have been committed elsewhere right under our noses in what is supposed to be a civilised age", "if he will make a statement on the time taken for uk aerospace companies to be paid for the work they carry out on the eurofighter project", "i thank the minister for that answer but he knows that that system often does not work one company in my constituency which does not want to be named has waited a long time for a tremendous amount of money for working on eurofighter and has been rebuked by eurofighter when it has tried to chase the money on speaking to the company it stressed that it does not blame the government but it does want them to introduce a new system that

debate i was going to apologise to my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west mr brady for missing part of his speech but he is returning the compliment by missing part of mine having left the chamber for a short whilei wanted to make a brief contribution because i believe that there is a need to concentrate on many education issues and i am not confident that we are quite getting the response right it is not necessarily a matter of party politics in some ways the problem is a lack of understanding of what is going on in the countryi should like first to speak generally and then to talk about children and young people who are losing out\u2014perhaps one or two in my own constituencymy constituency is very mixed it is agricultural but it also has a great deal of industry like many others it requires many skills including those needed in the health services i find that there is a great skills shortage there is a shortage of teachers for example every time i meet head teachers they tell me how difficult it is to recruit it is not that they have a great number of vacancies but the quality of applicants is not what it should be one head told me openly last week that if he had the choice he would not employ a number of teachers now in his school if he could find others who were better he thinks that they are substandard that is not a very good situationwe know that in the health service there is a shortage of doctors and nurses but less talked about is the shortage of scientific staff people are not training to go into that kind of workpart of the aerospace industry is in my constituency i was able to ask a question about it earlier today there is a shortage of people entering the industry of people wishing to go into what might be perceived as a dirty job being an engineer is perhaps not as glamorous as certain other types of workwe have skills shortages in so many walks of life yet we are apparently educating many people to degree level i am the first to acknowledge that the party i support when in government considerably increased the number of people going to university i think that that was a good thing i did not have the benefit of a university education i wish i hadsomething somewhere is going wrong when more and more people are entering university but many leave as graduates with no job to go into or enter jobs that do not require degrees i am not saying that one should go to university only in order to obtain a better job the value of the education must also be taken into account but there is something wrong when so many young people find themselves in jobs for which they are overqualified or have no jobs at all we must question therefore whether the governments 50 per cent target is necessaryas i have said while there are graduates who have no jobs or who are doing jobs that do not require degrees we have many skills shortages throughout the country so something somewhere is not working we need to address that problem and i am not convinced that we are doing soi turn to the second part of my speech in which i want to concentrate on the children we are leaving behind as several hon members have already mentioned there is a problem of children and young people missing out statistics from the last century show that most people have become more prosperous and that health services and housing have improved yet we seem to have developed an underclass of people it is an awful phrase which was used earlier but i cannot think of a better way of putting it we have a class of people who miss out completely they miss out on better health services they miss out on better housing they miss out on prosperity one of the reasons is that they also miss out on educationat least 50 per cent of the prison population and possibly nearer 60 per cent now are illiterate or semiliterate i would not for one moment say that illiteracy is an excuse for committing a crime somebody who is illiterate and commits a crime must be punished there is a question about what that punishment should be but they must comply with the law just as the rest of us do however we also have to accept that there is an obvious link between no education and crime our education system has been developing for an awfully long time so we have to question why so many children leave school without the basics of educationhon members have rightly concentrated on gcses international baccalaureates alevels and degrees but the other side of the issue is that a lot of our young people are leaving school without even being able to read and write that is a tragedy it is a waste for them and it is a tragedy for society because those people often go on to commit crimes the statistics show that 40 per cent of street crime 25 per cent of burglaries 20 per cent of criminal damage and a third of car thefts were carried out by 10 to 16yearolds when they should have been in school not only are they missing out on the education that might get them good jobs but they are causing an awful lot of problems for society we must ask ourselves why that is happeningi want to touch on another issue that is linked to that problem special educational needs which is a subject very close to my heart there is a very good special educational needs school called alderman knight in my constituency its pupils are frequently physically handicapped but they also have learning and behavioural difficulties that school does an excellent job my hon friend the member for epping forest mrs laing\u2014who also declines to hear my speech at the moment\u2014visited that school not long ago and she was very impressed by what she saw i ask the minister to visit that school too because it is under threat of closure gloucestershire county council is not conservative run i do not seek to make a party political point but it is run by an unholy liblab pact", "it was not a party political point at all gloucestershire county council wants to close that school it has already closed one special school in gloucestershire\u2014bownham park stroud\u2014and it has two further schools on the agenda for closure a former minister who dealt with special education told me that the governments reforms and proposals should not be seen as a green light to the closure of special schools\u2014okay\u2014but why is it happeningi ask the minister to come to gloucestershire to visit alderman knight school and to look the teachers parents and more importantly the pupils in the eye and tell them that he thinks that that school should close i do not believe that his heart is cold enough to do that i know a number of labour members\u2014perhaps i have had a drink with them downstairs gone on trips with them and perhaps even gone horse racing with them\u2014and i know that they would not want that school to close so why has gloucestershire county council got that agenda why is it allowed to get away with thatspecial educational needs is a big issue in itself but the wider point that i want to make is that such closures will not help to reduce the number of people who are missing out on education the government said that they have an inclusion policy yes a lot of people with special needs can be included in mainstream schools but very many cannot i ask the minister to consider that very important point", "the minister may be aware that the aerospace industry is very important in my constituency although a number of jobs have been lost in it over the years the industry tells me that the best thing that the government can do is ensure that it can compete on a level playing field fair trade was mentioned earlier and it is extremely important that companies in europe do not get help from their governments in meeting startup costs and winning orders when such help is not available to companies in this country will he ensure that we can compete on a level playing field will he also make sure that companies involved in joint projects get paid on time when they do the work", "to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will list the external consultants used by his department

infinitely better", "i rise to speak in the debate without declaring an interest as i am not a regular rail user that is because the service between cheltenham gloucester and london is appallingly bad i support all hon members who have commented to that effecti congratulate the hon member for northavon mr webb on securing the debate i know that his intentions are genuine and that he would not have raised the subject had it not been so importantwhat is wrong with the cheltenham service cheltenham and gloucester are a main town and city and therefore deserve much better rail services than they have the frequency is poor and the reliability is poorthe direct service between cheltenham gloucester and london is limited many trains require passengers to change at swindon and the quality and safety of the train that takes them from cheltenham to swindon is questionable one would struggle to find a bus that was worse or more antiquatedthe length of the journey is another problem it can take well over two hours and it is easy to drive to london in that time if one then adds in the length of time it takes to get to the initial station and the time to travel across london that is at least another hour that is why so many people drive because they cannot depend on the trains to get them to london on time or even to get them there at all nor can they depend on having refreshments when they are on the trainthe whole service is a disaster and i want to bring it to the attention of the minister if he is not aware of it already and to the house i am being far less polite and measured in my terms than the hon member for northavon was but that reinforces my point\u2014the service is dreadfulthe situation has been made worse and possibly more frustrating by the fact that some while ago i attended a meeting with first great western which runs the trains from cheltenham to london and was promised that better services were on the way i cannot remember the exact date of that meeting but it is long enough ago to suggest that there should be some difference by now i am not however aware of any sign of a differenceon top of that is the quality of the station at cheltenham which for a mainline station is appalling some time ago we were promised an hourly service to london from a small station called ashchurch which is near tewkesbury i do not expect the minister to be aware of that station or the situation but i would appreciate it if he examined the matter and wrote to me about it that promise was made to people in the area and just before todays debate started i spoke to the parish council which is concerned about the stations current viabilitytime is short i would like to say a lot more but i cannot i will say only that it is a copout to blame privatisation as it avoids examining the real issue we hear that fragmentation has been the cause of the problem but i cannot think of a transport industry that is more fragmented that the airline industry not all airports are owned by the same company and there are goodness knows how many air operators but the quality of the service is far better and it is safer and more reliablethe fragmentation argument is nonsense if there is any problem in that regard it is that there are not enough rail providers we do not have the choice that privatisation perhaps should have brought and competitive rail services would improve the situation if we are saying that british rail should be the model for every industry it is no wonder that people have no faith in politicians", "to ask the

food shortages and subsequent possible famine in ethiopia i thank the minister the hon member for stroud mr drew\u2014who will accompany me on a visit that i shall mention shortly\u2014and other hon members for attendingthe debate is timely not only because of the recent warnings and appeal for help by the ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi but because an interparliamentary union delegation leaves for ethiopia on saturday i have the honour of having been appointed to lead it i also have the pleasure of being a member of the british ethiopian society and secretary of the allparty britishethiopian group i remain in regular contact with the ethiopian ambassador to the united kingdom his excellency fisseha adugna who is an active and impressive representative of his country and a friendwhy am i so interested in ethiopia like many people my interest developed in the 1984 crisis when bob geldof and live aid did so much to highlight the problems in that country two years ago a threatened famine reawakened that interest i am personally concerned not because i have travelled to that country\u2014i have not yet done so\u2014nor because of any business links to the region but because ethiopia is so poor its residents regularly face hunger and possible starvation the aid agencies believe that things can be done to alleviate that poverty and at least mitigate if not remove the threat of hunger and famine in futurei shall discuss mediumterm and longerterm measures shortly first i want to concentrate on the urgent need for food aid for which the ethiopian government pleaded recently earlier this year the short belg rains failed and the long kiremt rains occurred in late summer rather than earlier resulting in a long dry period the loss of those rains meant crop failure and further reduced pasture and water resources with the latter leading to extensive livestock deaths in affected areas and poor physical conditions for surviving animals in turn that led to severely limited access to a green harvest of important lean season foods and the limited availability of livestock products serious food shortages are reported in several parts of the countrythere is therefore an urgent need for emergency food aid the disaster prevention and preparedness commission says that the people who need assistance between october and december this year will peak at 63 million requiring approximately 270000 metric tonnes of food the world food programme reported last month that such aid has been promised although delivering it as quickly as possible is now urgent however the impact of the current drought is expected to extend into next year as the failure of the rains has affected the growth of longcycle cropsninetyseven per cent of crops are rain fed and more than 85 per cent of ethiopians are subsistence farmers who depend on their maher\u2014november december and january\u2014harvest that food will simply not be there in most years ethiopia depends on a certain amount of food aid to feed its people but the position is now far more acute the disaster prevention and preparedness commission estimates that as many as 143 million people could need assistance in the coming yeara total of approximately 2 million metric tonnes of food will be required to meet the need with 500000 metric tonnes being required in the first quarter of next year such a requirement is unprecedented even during the highly publicised famine of 1984\u201385 i admit that that is the worstcase scenario but the world should be prepared for it the world must respond immediately because it takes a long time from reaching an agreement to help to delivering the food to the needy much food would be delivered through the single port of djibouti and therefore planning is essential to ensure that it has the capacity to cope with the influxthe response from the united kingdom and the european union is disappointing i hope that a further announcement will be made by the department for international development before we leave for ethiopia but i am concerned that the government appear reluctant to commit themselves to providing urgent food aid that could save peoples lives", "the hon gentleman raises a very important point i am not qualified to say whether genetically modified food is safe but i know that many people are concerned about it i am certainly concerned about its safety and perhaps representations could be made for nongm food to be sent after all as i am about to say there is hardly a shortage of food in the worlda world that produces more food than its population can eat can surely provide relief in the european union we actually pay farmers not to farm the 93000 tonnes pledged by the eu out of the first quarter requirement of up to 500000 tonnes could surely be increased let us not forget that during the height of the common agricultural policys folly\u2014ironically around the mid1980s when ethiopias problems came to light and when volunteers such as bob geldof were doing their utmost and the british public were digging deep into their own pockets\u2014the eu spent half its entire budget on storing and disposing of surpluses i realise that distribution problems existed at the time but is it not obscene that people in one part of the world should destroy food while others only a few hours away starve to death it is certainly obscene but it is not inevitablethe failure of the rains has exacerbated an already dire situation which is perpetuated by ongoing poverty at least 80 different languages are spoken in ethiopia\u2014which the secretary of state has referred to as one of the poorest countries in the world\u2014and it contains an even higher number of tribes the common theme that links them all is sadly poverty with a large part of the population living on less than 1 a day on many occasions people have cut trees down to sell for firewood that leaves the topsoil exposed increasing the risk of it being washed away if the rain should come that would leave the ground hard and infertile thereby adding to the desertification additionally with the population growing rapidly in rural areas trees and vegetation are being cleared to create more arable land other family assets have also been sold in an attempt to ward off shortterm poverty all those actions have resulted in the continuation of that poverty and of the cycle of drought and famineit is a paradoxical fact that ethiopia does not have a water shortage\u2014a number of rivers notably the blue nile cross its plateau\u2014but it has a poor record of water management with only 5 per cent of its irrigable land being irrigated the country lacks the money and the expertise to create the necessary irrigation and it is a tragedy that such schemes were not provided by development aid following the tragic events of 1984\u201385 why did that not happenethiopia also lacks adequate storage facilities in the last two years it has enjoyed good harvests but has been unable to store sufficient food to alleviate the present problem again it would have been relatively easy for the developed world to provide such assistance how sad it is that such measures were not taken when those very actions would have had the potential to end famine in the countrythe developed world could have helped in other ways too particularly by reviewing trade rules the value of ethiopias exports per capita is the lowest in the world and even those exports have been hit hard by the slump in coffee prices which have fallen by 70 per cent in four years that has cost ethiopia almost half its total annual export earnings again how sad it is that the country that gave the world coffee is suffering so much from that commodity being its main export however with other products too the european union should look to help by removing the protective barriers that mean that many eu farmers remain inefficient and wasteful while thirdworld exporters are forced to subsist on a pittancedebt too is an area in which the developed world can help total debt in ethiopia has reached about 150 per cent of gross domestic product and the cost of servicing that debt has risen to 118 million a year which is about 12 per cent of revenues by contrast the government have spent only 135 million\u2014a tenth of the cost of their debt interest payments\u2014on food relief since july the world bank the international monetary fund and other shareholders should cancel that debt completely and immediately with strings attached if necessary to give ethiopia a chanceother problems abound aids has had a devastating effect on ethiopia as it has had on other areas of africa many heads of household have lost their lives through the disease and many orphans have been created thereby perpetuating poverty once again poverty leads to further poverty as further shortterm measures are taken with disastrous medium to longterm results yet ethiopia has so much to be proud of in terms of its history and recent developmentsethiopia is the land of the fabled queen of sheba the home of the ark of the covenant the country of origin of coffee and the land where lucy and more recently other remains dating back 44 million years were discovered it can boast not only the longest archeological record of any country but the fact that it has been independent longer than any country in africa and that it was the first in the west after armenia to adopt christianityin modern terms the overthrow of the dictator colonel mengistu haile mariam by the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front and the move to democracy in 1992 which was followed by the appointment of meles zenawi as prime minister in 1995 represent an impressive political turnaround low inflation of 13 per cent and growth of 46 per cent are also impressive but ethiopia cannot realise its full potential nor repeat its impressive history while it remains in the grip of povertyhelp is needed including immediate emergency food aid development aid debt relief a change in trade rules and reduced eu tariffs and it is within the scope of the developed world to help in those ways the uk should lead by setting an example when we leave for ethiopia on saturday we should be delighted to take good news with us including details of how much aid this country is to provide

very important as the minister said in his impressive maiden speech from the dispatch box in an education debate the value of education cannot be overestimated or overstated i should like to explore what that meansi have the distinction which is not unique among conservative members of having attended a secondary modern school when i was 11 although i did go on to grammar school for the sixth form that secondary modern provided me with a good basic education and a lot more i will never forget what the headmaster used to say every day in assembly school assembly is still a legal requirement although some schools do not fulfil their legal duties in that respect he used to remind us that the school was a family and that sentiment will remain with me to my dying day as it was important not only did we learn about history english and french but about behaviour morals and ethics\u2014words that we do not use enough these days i like to think that that fostered good behaviour within the school because pupils went to learn not only about history and geography but about how to behave i do not claim that no one who went to that school went wrong\u2014human nature is such that some did\u2014but it was an important aspect of running the school however that was a long time agoi was looking through some old papers a few years ago and found a report from my wifes school my wife enjoys slight superiority to me and we noticed that in her class she was one of 47 pupils we now have a rule that classes of a certain age cannot have more than 30 pupils but it was acceptable then it was probably easier for the teacher to control the class of 46 or 47 pupils than it is to control a class of 30 now so something has changedone change is that in those days pupils were far better behaved which enabled teachers to control the class with no great difficulty those teachers did not have the same burden of paperwork as presentday teachers and the pupils formed part of a more cohesive family unit i am pleased to see the hon member for west lancashire mr pickthall back in his place because he made a very useful contribution to the debate he spoke about special needs with which i shall deal in a moment but also about the makeup of families although he was not critical of the modern family he pointed out that new challenges were presented by the fact that families are not what they used to be the wider family no longer exists in the same waywhen i visit schools\u2014i have regular meetings with head teachers and meet about a dozen every three months\u2014an issue that comes across strongly is that teachers now feel like social workers the minister and the whole house will be aware of that teachers feel that they are not getting the support to which they are entitled from many families teachers are not social workers and should not be expected to fulfil the role of parents we should not be afraid of saying thatteachers are also concerned about their inability to expel\u2014or exclude or whatever the modern word is\u2014pupils from school and there is some confusion as to whether they can or should expel and what happens to the expelled pupil thereafter i am mature enough to realise that the story does not end with expelling a pupil indeed that is only the beginning what does that pupil go on to do the heads to whom i speak claim with great justification that they must have the ability to remove a pupil from school not only to punish the pupil although that should be part of it but to protect the education of the other 29 pupils in the class another problem is that pupils are aware of their rights how often do we hear the word rights without its being linked to responsibilities pupils are aware of their rights and they play on that teachers have a heck of a job trying to control classesthe hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman said that according to the reports that he has seen only one school in 12 has problems that however is an awful lot of schools it is a frightening figure so let us not try to play it down i come from an area that used to have very high unemployment which i regret with one in 10 or 11 out of work labour members used to say that that was a shameful figure the figure of one in 12 schools is also shameful i do not entirely blame the present government but let us not pretend that there is not a serious problem there certainly isi accept that parents must play their role but i draw the houses attention to one or two other role models who have not quite played the game as they should have done i have deliberately used the phrase played the game because i refer to footballers pop stars and even members of parliament few people are impressed by the yahboo politics that we sometimes have in the house and they wonder why they send us here i am all for the dramatic speeches that we heard from my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant and the hon member for ealing north mr pound and the house would be a much poorer place without such speeches there was a good deal of common sense and sound politics in what they said the house will understand when i say that perhaps we too should take seriously our duty as role modelsi do not want to be party political but i have to be somewhat critical of the government as i deeply regret what they have done concerning cannabis this week the house is not only about passing laws but about the signals that we send and reducing the classification has sent a most unfortunate signal to young people cannabis is not the same as alcohol or tobacco the taking of drugs leads to disrupted and ruined lives and to criminal activity to finance the habit that has a terribly destructive effect on schoolson the subject of crime i return to the value of education this really is a piecemeal speech and i am trying to get through it as quickly as i can i understand that 90odd per cent of people in prison have some form of mental illness be it severe or mild and i think that between 50 and 60 per cent have virtually no education and are either illiterate or semiliterate we should be ashamed of that in this day and age when we spend billions of pounds on education too many people come out of school without being able to read and write that is not an excuse for committing crime but it is a fact that many of those people do it we must accept that that is a failure in our societyi have raised this point with the minister several times and i will continue to do so until i get a satisfactory response i admired the secretary of state when she gave her verdict on the comprehensive system i was a victim of the 11plus\u2014i failed it\u2014but i also stood out against the introduction of the comprehensive system because i thought it was wrong she did not condemn all comprehensive schools and neither will i my daughter went to a very good comprehensive school\u2014bournside in cheltenham\u2014having left a very poor public school the secretary of state made a good point when she said that the system is not delivering what was intendedif the government are being brave and enlightened enough to take that line and accept that comprehensive schooling may not be the answer to all societys ills what is the logic of their programme of the inclusion of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools many such children are included entirely appropriately but a great many others need special schools for their own sake it may be convenient to call it inclusion but if they come out of the school without the proper education that they need they are excluded from society for the rest of their livesi urge ministers to talk to teachers heads parents governors and indeed the children about whether their special schools should be closed the government have said that their inclusion policy is not a green light to close special schools i am sure that everyone is sick of hearing me say it but the fact is that in gloucestershire which is not controlled by the conservative party there is a deliberate programme of closure of the special schools it is a wrong policy pupils have come to me in tears because they feel that they are losing not only their school but their best chance of an appropriate educationthe word appropriate is the key i had an appropriate education it was not a university education\u2014before the sixth form it was not even a grammar school education\u2014but it was the appropriate education for me i urge the minister to look into what is happening in gloucestershire and tell the liberal democrat and labour groups which control the county council that it is not the governments intention that special schools should be closed i urge the minister for goodness sake to go to gloucestershire and tell the council that it should not be closing those schools", "does the minister accept that while it is the task of parliament and ministers to pass legislation the message

have to travel to those areas the town of tewkesbury needs regenerating or there will be serious problems and we will waste a jewel of a place but it has had applications turned downin order for people in tewkesbury to benefit from something in gloucester they have to travel by car i was privileged to take part in the debate on communities initiated by the government a couple of weeks ago it is essential to keep people in the areas where they live for part of their leisure time if we are to build up communities", "i am grateful to the minister for giving way and for his advice on community fund applications at the time of the previous debate it was easier to obtain figures from the department for culture media and sport about the number of applications that were made but i am told that it does not have that information now at that time applications from organisations in tewkesbury were just as frequent and as many as those from other constituencies in gloucestershire and we asked for as much money as they did", "i am pleased to secure this debate and thank the minister for attending i am listed to discuss lottery grants in gloucestershire and indeed i want to do so but i hope that you will forgive me mr deputy speaker for making particular reference to my constituency of tewkesbury as we have lost out considerably in the distribution of such grantsi held a debate on 20 december 2000 to discuss this issue i met the then minister the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey who was helpful since then in spite of her gallant efforts nothing seems to have improved for my constituency i discovered at the time that organisations from tewkesbury were applying for just as many grants as those from other constituencies and for as much money but they were being turned downthere are six parliamentary seats in gloucestershire and tewkesbury applied for about one sixth of the money which was right we played the lottery as much as the other constituencies one sixth is about 17 per cent yet we received less than three per cent of the money coming to the county that did not seem rightthe minister and i discussed a number of the failed bids in detail i was assured that the government were considering improving the processing of applications and the way in which help might be given to applicants at early stages despite that there has been no change in the amount of lottery grant coming to my area since the lotterys inception in 1994 organisations in gloucestershire as a whole have received \u00a3837 million yet only \u00a329 million\u201434 per cent\u2014has found its way to tewkesbury if we divide gloucestershire roughly into six we should have 17 per cent of the money equating to about \u00a3142 million coincidentally that is the national average for lottery grants to constituencies we are nowhere near that figureto put the problem in perspective neighbouring gloucester has received \u00a3287 million and cotswold has received \u00a3202 million i do not begrudge those areas their money\u2014if they have made applications and been given grants good luck to them it seems odd however that compared with \u00a3287 million and \u00a3202 million tewkesbury receives less than \u00a33 million i wonder whywhen i looked into the matter met the minister held a debate and discussed the problem with one or two heads of the departments distributing lottery money one of the criteria given for distribution was deprivation that is not a good measure what does deprived mean does it mean that it is a poor area or that there are few facilities or amenities i mentioned that cotswold has received \u00a320 million in lottery grants one could hardly describe it as deprived yet it received seven times as much money as tewkesbury i stress that i do not begrudge cotswold its money but i would rather see a fairer share come to tewkesburyif the word deprived means poor many betteroff areas have pockets of deprivation but because of the way the calculations are made they are not recognised particularly if those pockets straddle two electoral wards deprived may mean few facilities but many wealthy areas have no amenities some welloff villages do not have a single shop\u2014are they deprived what exactly do we mean by deprivedthe calculation based on deprivation tends to centre on inner cities and towns as i have asked before what about rural poverty i highlighted that in my last speech but since then the situation in the countryside has got worse farming incomes have fallen further and foot and mouth has devastated the rural scene i am pleased that the minister is replying to this debate because he is also the minister for sport and he may know that the cheltenham race course is in my constituency we lost the cheltenham racing festival last year that hit my area hard and should be taken into account in debating deprivation and the allocation and distribution of lottery grantsi do not want to go too far into this subject but my area given its dependence on the racing industry and the national hunt race course will be hit hard if the government decide to ban hunting i say that as someone who does not hunt but the government should be aware of that problem i am sure that i will be called to order if i go any further down that road in those circumstances from where would the compensation come for my constituency would it come from lottery grants or because of the way that it is calculated would we continue to slip through the netthe perception is that tewkesbury is well off but that is not true it is not poor but it is certainly not wealthy like many other areas it has problems with drug pushers drug users and people who commit crimes because they are taking drugs it has a town\u2014tewkesbury itself\u2014that needs regeneration because there are many empty shops it is a wonderful place to visit but it needs some help other areas have few facilities and the constituency also suffers from having excessive housebuilding requirements forced on it it is all right to build houses but that does not create a community we must keep those people in the area to create a community but if the lottery grants do not help the projects that creates a further problemthe southwest is generally not that well off it is poorly served by the railway network although many constituencies could claim that and it loses out on funding for services such as education health policing and local government in recognition of the unequal lottery distribution the government introduced a system for fairer distribution and identified 51 areas for targeting again the criteria were that the areas had to be deprived and have received less lottery funding than other parts of the country so far so good but of those 51 areas 50 had received more money than tewkesbury as i said we have received less than \u00a33 million while brent which was targeted for more money has received \u00a3138 million portsmouth received \u00a363 million my home town of bolton about which i can claim to know a little received \u00a334 million while blackpool received \u00a383 million\u2014is it deprived there are other figures doncaster received \u00a361 million oldham \u00a316 million and kirklees \u00a335 million some of those areas may have bigger populations but even if we multiple tewkesburys population proportionally we do not get anywhere near comparable figures however those areas are targeted under what is called the english fair share initiative where is the fairness and how will things improve for my constituencyorganisations in tewkesbury have made many good applications and i have seen some in detail recently there was an application to make improvements to the famous tewkesbury abbey one to upgrade the bishops cleeve tithe barn and many other examples that i could mention however all were turned down and despite promises the area remains poorly funded in terms of lottery money indeed gloucestershire comes sixth out of six in terms of total funding if we break that down into the six categories it is bottom of the list in four and fifth out of six in the remaining two so we lose out in every which wayperhaps the minister will be kind enough to answer my questions i certainly intend to leave him enough time to do so what about the merits of individual applications how are decisions about the applications weighted and made what is meant by deprivation how is it calculated and how big an area in each constituency is measured i ask the right hon gentleman to review that criterion as a means of deciding which areas should benefit from lottery funding why is the distribution of lottery money across the country still so unequal i have given examples why does my constituency keep losing out so badlythe national lottery was started in 1994 with the objective of helping projects that would benefit the community it was a way of helping those projects without calling on taxation which might be inappropriate the lottery was set up not to supplement taxation but as an alternative way of raising funds so that community projects could benefitthe lottery has had much success in a number of areas the one or two projects that have benefited in tewkesbury have been tremendously successful but there have not been that many of them this is the second time that i have raised the issue in the house of commons and i do not intend to let it slip because a number of organisations in tewkesbury are pressing me to ask why we do not get our fair share", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry if she will make a statement about increased powers which the export control bill will give to her to ensure that exported arms

pleasure to see those who are here and i congratulate them on having turned up and taken partwe have heard no fewer than 14 backbench speeches all of which made an important contribution many debates become repetitive but on this occasion each speech has added something new to the debate and it has been a privilege to listen to itthe secretary of state opened the debate by making several important points one or two of which i should like to add to he talked about the benefits of the european union to wales we should bear it in mind that one of the problems involved in the money that comes from europe is that it is no more than recycled money from the very few net contributors to the european union of which this country is one we should not get too excited about what europe may be doing for wales the secretary of state mentioned that money in the context of objective 1 arrangements as he will be aware the report points to problems with delays in objective 1 payments the welsh european funding office an executive agency of the national assembly is responsible for such payments clearly members of the committee believe that that issue should be urgently addressedthe secretary of state spoke about wales with obvious pride and stressed what a beautiful country it is in describing the importance of tourism he explained why wales has not been able to promote itself throughout the world as have england scotland northern ireland and indeed the republic his comments about the problems faced by wales were useful and gave a good background to the subject although that does not mean to say that we should let the matter rest therethe shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans made several practical points at times he was somewhat controversial which is not unusual for him in discussing the cost of the assembly building he suggested that the money might have been better spent on some of the more important functions of government in walesmy hon friend also covered matters relating to tourism such as peoples ability nowadays to travel abroad very cheaply it sometimes costs more to drive to and park at the airport than to fly to certain elegant settings in europe and beyond that problem should not be underestimated i speak as an englishman\u2014i say that before anyone else can\u2014but i have spent many weeks and months travelling wales and have enjoyed many holidays there it has recently become obvious to me that fewer people are doing that because it is so easy and cheap to travel abroad my hon friend put his finger on an important point and characteristically suggested one or two ways in which it might be addressed\u2014for example by improving airportsmy hon friend touched on the problem of itv digital which has unfortunately hit wales very hard i want to return to that in a few minutesthe hon member for clwyd south mr jones who chairs the welsh affairs select committee gave a comprehensive and useful outline of the report it was interesting to hear about the number and quality of the people he invited to give evidence one or two of whom if they had turned up would have attracted a record attendance at the committee it is sad that that did not happen he also listed several people who have welsh ancestry and pointed out that many people have welsh ancestry but do not recognise it that was an important point he also mentioned several things that are associated with wales again it is perhaps unfortunate that that is not fully recognisedi like and admire the hon member for montgomeryshire lembit \u00f6pik a great deal as ever he made an entertaining speech full of good points he mentioned the aerospace industry which several other hon members discussed it is also important to my constituency of tewkesbury where several aerospace jobs have been lost there have been many aerospace mergers but there are also many opportunities it is therefore important for the united kingdom especially wales to grasp themit is important for aerospace companies in this country to work on a level playing field we hear so much about the level playing field for agriculture but it is no less vital for aerospace we must ensure that our competitors do not receive benefits from their governments that the government do not give ours i am asking not for handouts to aerospace companies\u2014far from it\u2014but for them not to be disadvantaged when competing with companies abroad", "yes i am sure that the minister will respond to that point the hon member for montgomeryshire talked a great deal about his constituency as well as estonia i am sure that he will not be described as the hon member for estonia for long after todaythe hon member for cynon valley ann clwyd spoke about waless wider role in human rights she made an extremely interesting and important contributionthe hon member for meirionnydd nant conwy mr llwyd\u2014i hope that i have pronounced it correctly\u2014hon members well done since serving on a standing committee with the hon member for ceredigion mr thomas i have been practising pronouncing some welsh names the hon member for meirionnydd nant conwy spoke about tourism and the need to market wales better that was a recurring theme of the debatethe hon member for gower mr caton spoke about the importance of perception and stressed the amount that wales has to offermy hon friend the member for hertford and stortford mr prisk spoke about wales positively but he outlined several matters on which we need to concentrate including the need for greater research funding and capability which one or two other hon members also mentioned he referred to waless low profile in the business world but he also mentioned the millennium stadium which adds credibility and brings recognition to wales that is extremely positivemy hon friend spoke about entrepreneurial problems entrepreneurial is difficult to pronounce and i understand why the right hon member for swansea east donald anderson suggested that it was not an english or a welsh word my hon friend also talked about the low rate of startups there is a need in wales and throughout the united kingdom to stop standing in the way of small businesses and to encourage them as best we canthe hon member for vale of clwyd chris ruane mentioned involving more politicians in spreading the news about wales throughout the world and using the many celebrities that wales can boast he made an extremely important point about his regret at the running down of wales and also about\u2014i hesitate to use the term\u2014racist or strongly nationalist remarks perhaps he felt that they were damaging he drew support from all sides about that it is a problem in most countries but it does not help wales and he was right to draw attention to itthe hon member for caernarfon hywel williams discussed secondments from business to promote wales abroad and made many other detailed points the hon member for ogmore huw irrancadavies made a lively speech that reminded me of his excellent maiden speech in which he broke with convention by being controversial and party political as well as entertaining whenever he is on his feet in the chamber i shall do my best to listen to the important points that he makes he stressed how important it is to remember that we are here not only as mps from wales england northern ireland or scotland but as members of the united kingdom parliament and that we should do all that we can to promote the united kingdom as a whole as well as promoting all its partsthe hon member for aberavon dr francis made some important points about welsh history as someone who is interested in history i believe that it can make the present and the future come alive and i found his remarks most refreshing the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan rightly condemned the hooligans at the football match last night he also talked about cardiffs bid to become the european capital of culture in 2008 while hon members from different areas might have conflicting interests in relation to which city achieves that title i certainly wish cardiff wellthe right hon member for swansea east reminded us in a characteristically interesting speech of welsh stars and of famous and important people whom we really should use more as has been suggestedthe hon member for alyn and deeside mark tami spoke about the importance of the aerospace industry and the airbus he also mentioned the textile industry about which i too have some concerns having worked in it for many years in north wales and elsewherelast but not least the hon member for monmouth mr edwards spoke about the attractiveness of his area\u2014which he insists is welsh\u2014and about the importance of japanese investment in wales", "i certainly agree i understand that there are plans to build another race course in wales if that goes ahead i wish it luck it is always a privilege to visit chepstow race course even though i usually\u2014not always\u2014come away a lot poorer but in another way much richer for the experience of having been thereit is important to recognise the investment made not only by the japanese but by the americans that kind of investment adds to the international flavour that we all want to see in wales i was rather disturbed to discover the extent of the decline of inward investment in wales\u2014i was not aware of the extent of it until i researched this debate the levels used to be a lot higher than they are now they are still impressive when compared with the population size but it is a matter that we need to addresswe also need to address the problems of agriculture which is also in decline all these things declining is not very good as the hon member for rhondda mr bryant pointed out in an intervention it is important that we put out goodnews stories about wales by way of an analogy i take a great interest in ethiopia the ambassador for ethiopia always tells me how important it is for his country to get the right image across ethiopia is not just about desperate people suffering starvation and disease that is not the sum total of the country he feels that it is important to get across the right image for his country and it is important to do the same for waleswe need to address the problems of agriculture my hon friend the member for ribble valley was right to say that there should be a public inquiry into foot and mouth disease which was as devastating for wales as it was for so many other areas it is also important that farmers and others working in agriculture should be allowed to diversify we often find however that they are blocked from doing so by the rules of planning i am sure that that applies throughout the united kingdom and it is another issue that needs to be addressedi would like to make many more points but time is against me this has been a very interesting debate and i shall finish by echoing the words of my hon friend the member for ribble valley who suggested that having concluded this debate we should not just go away and forget about what has been said let us use many of the points that have been raised on both sides of the house for the benefit of wales", "that is not the point", "to ask the secretary of state for scotland if she will make a statement on the use of smart card technology in her department and in the areas for which it is responsible and what discussions she has had with private companies about the use of smart card technology within her department", "to ask the secretary of state for health what progress has been made with the review into the kent ambulance nhs trust and when it is expected to be complete", "to ask the secretary of state for the home department if he will make a statement on the use of smart card technology in his department and in the areas for which it is responsible and what discussions he has had with private companies about the use of smart card technology within his department", "to ask the parliamentary secretary lord chancellors department if he will make a statement on the use of smart card technology in the department and in the areas for which it is responsible and what discussions he has had with private companies about the use of smart card technology within his department", "impossible", "will the hon gentleman give way", "the hon gentleman knows that he is my parents mp and that my father was a miner will he not respect the right of rural communities to live the life they have lived for many years just as he wanted mining communities to be able to do", "it is a pleasure to follow the hon member for sheffield attercliffe mr betts i agree with what he has said and want to deal with one or two of those issues myselfthis is an important debate because of course communities collectively make up the nation i want to refer to the fact that a community is more of a spirit of course communities are created in many ways and pubs churches village shops and post offices make them up but the social interaction that takes place is also importanti fully accept that the government and local government have roles to play in engendering that spirit and in improving the lives of people in their local communities however we should remember that the social interaction that i mentioned springs from selfresponsibility and from people doing things for each other not just leaving it to the government or local government too much influence from central and local government can break down communities that is evident in many areaspeople should feel that they have stake in the community that is a matter not only of owning their own houses although that is important but of taking pride in existing institutions\u2014in the churches pubs and shops\u2014and in each other and in their neighbourly behaviour the hon member for sheffield attercliffe gave many examples of how antisocial behaviour can break down communities ownership of communities and of the institutions and spirit within them is extremely importantin a constitutional context too much government can break down community spirit where possible local councils should be made smaller to make them responsible and responsive many parts of the country have parish councils and town councils which are more local and more responsive local people who sit on them often feel a sense of ownership and responsibility in doing so parliament should consider the role of town and parish councils district councils although smaller than county councils can be remote from many of the people whom they represent\u2014especially in areas that are larger in terms of size or population certainly county councils can be remotei urge the government not to go down the road of regional government in the southwest it matters little to people in tewkesbury whether decisions are made in exeter or bristol or in london if possible decisions relating to tewkesbury should be made in tewkesbury if not it makes no difference whether they are made in london or in exeter as neither would bring local benefit to the communityon development\u2014house building in other words\u2014it is important when providing housing not just to build houses several places in my constituency started off as pretty villages where there was a community spirit more houses were built but not a balanced community because there were no amenities to go with them people who live in them have to go elsewhere to shop or to use leisure facilities that does not build up community spirit it breaks it down any development that has to take place\u2014although we should question whether certain areas should be developed\u2014should be sustainable we hear a great deal about sustainability but what does it mean it means building a balanced community and having respect for it so that people can both live and function in it they should not just go home to sleep and have to go elsewhere to do other things\u2014those amenities should exist within the communitydecisions on where to build houses should take account of towns and cities which require regeneration that can by done by building on brownfield sites or by using flats above shops\u2014and by ensuring that shops do not close in the first place as they often do that has the dual effect of not destroying green belt sites or greenfield sites which are quickly being swallowed upwe could also regenerate towns and cities by not taking so much money out of them we should be imaginative about what used to be called enterprise zones if there are serious problems in an area perhaps instead of taxing people who live there and then feeding them the money back under a scheme that was designed in london the government should take less money out of that area in the first place it might be a revolutionary idea perhaps we should have taxfree zones in those areas for two or three years to encourage enterprising people to move there to live to set up businesses and to employ local people on second thoughts i do not think that it is a particularly revolutionary idea but it is an imaginative idea which i have had for a long time i would like the government to engage in that type of thinkingmany hon members have spoken about the destructive effect of crime and the fear of crime on local communities it eats away at the spirit and the performance of a community tolerance of crime is not an option people who have studied what has happened in new york\u2014i have not done so in detail\u2014have found that the successes that they have had in that city seem to have come from the opposite of a tolerance of crime a zero tolerance of crimei understand that in that city people can be arrested for very minor offences but it may then be discovered that those people have committed many other offences and if they are charged for them they can be taken off the streets it has long been true that as has been said a very high percentage of crimes in a given area are committed by a very few people and we really cannot let those people keep disrupting communities in my opinion zero tolerance is the way forward not the tolerance of crime that we seem to be accepting these daysthat brings me to the subject of drugs because we hear reports\u2014i do not know how accurate\u2014that in certain areas tolerance is shown to the possession of cannabis i declare straight away that i oppose the legalisation of cannabis on practical as well as moral grounds because when i speak to the police in my area they tell me that a very high percentage of heroin addicts started off on cannabis it is no use going down the politically correct route of saying that cannabis is okay and is the same as drink or cigarettes it is not it is very different and if we are going to start tolerating crime in that way it will be the thin end of the wedge it is no use having antisocial behaviour orders if we are to tolerate illegal acts that cannot be the way forwardwe all know how much crime is committed in the pursuit of money to buy drugs we should move in the other direction we should stamp out drug use and the drug trade because it is destroying the lives of very many people\u2014not just those who take the drugs but those who are affected by the crimes committed by people who want to purchase thema great deal of crime is committed by people with little or no education i cannot quote the statistic exactly but between 50 and 60 per cent of people in prison are illiterate or have very low literacy that is not an excuse for crime however and we cannot say that because someone is illiterate they should not go to prison i am not making that case i have said that i believe in the tougher control of crime i believe in tougher sentencing for many crimes however we should recognise why crime is committed\u2014not tolerate it but try to understand why it is committed by some people in the first place with a view to stamping it out if we can we should not only provide better education for those who go to university but turn our attention to those who have an alleged education for 11 years and yet leave school without any literacy or numeracy skills that cannot be right and we should try to find out why it is happening", "the hon gentleman makes a good point like other hon members i have discussed such issues with teachers and head teachers however they do point out that the inability to exclude such pupils easily enough causes great disruption to schools that problem must be dealt with but i recognise what the hon gentleman is saying it is all right expelling pupils but where should they then go should they go to another school which they then disrupt or should they simply hang around on the streets where they are a nuisance to societyshould they end up in prison when someone ends up in prison it is a tragedy for them for their family for the taxpayer and even for the victim of the crime we should do our utmost to prevent people from getting into the situations that lead to their committing the crimes that result in going to prison one method is to improve education at school age as i said i am delighted that many people go to university and get a good education but we also need to consider those who are slipping through the net and not getting any education at alla great many people are in employment these days\u2014as my hon friend the member for poole mr syms said we handed the labour government a very sound economy which they have not quite managed to destroy just yet\u2014so to some extent there is a skills shortage however i speak with some experience when i say that the collapse of certain industries has destroyed many communities the mining and steel industries are the obvious examples but we should remember the textile industry in which i worked for many years many people in that industry who were low paid to start with lost their jobs it is very difficult for such communities to share in the general wealth of the nation given that they started from such a low base only for their industries to be destroyed that has proved a terrible problem particularly in the farming industrywe have concentrated\u2014probably rightly\u2014on many of the problems in towns and inner cities but i want to touch on those affecting rural areas i represent a constituency that is by and large rural and its communities have experienced many difficulties they suffer because of their rurality which is not adequately compensated for because of the way that local government grants are assessed however there are also problems with transport rural areas suffer from very poor transport links and there is also much poverty and crimemore and more people from rural communities are complaining to me\u2014in person and in writing\u2014about crime in their areas we should not ignore that issue although my constituency is not considered an area of deprivation pockets of deprivation exist we have awful problems with drug dealers and with theft in certain parts of the constituency and i am rather peeved that the national lottery grants do not adequately reflect that fact areas are assessed in terms of overall deprivation but it is not recognised that certain pockets of deprivation\u2014perhaps such as those in my constituency\u2014do not have the full amenities and levels of wealth that other parts of the country enjoyto some extent the government have recognised the problem they intend to concentrate on improving national lottery grants for 51 areas that they have identified throughout the country but i should point out that 50 of those areas already receive more money than tewkesbury does as the member of parliament for tewkesbury i find that a little difficult to understand and hard to take i have initiated one adjournment debate on that issue already and i am applying for another although tewkesbury has applied for about a sixth of the money that has been applied for in gloucestershire\u2014there are six constituencies in the county so that is about right\u2014it has received only 3 per cent of the amount available to the county that is not acceptable to my constituents who play the lottery as keenly as anyone else they do not think that they are getting an adequate reward for thaton the theme of rural communities farms are not only family businesses that generate sources of income on which people rely for their living but a crucial part of the countryside farmers are the custodians of the countryside and have suffered terribly not only from the bse crisis but from the foot and mouth crisis as well which hit my constituency hard in addition although i do not want to make a party political point the government are ignoring some of the bigger problems in the country and are determined to ban huntingi do not hunt and never have indeed i have not always lived in a rural area i lived in bolton in lancashire for 33 years and did not have a view on hunting because i knew nothing about it i remind the government that the burns report which they commissioned identified that events and organisations like gymkhanas and pony clubs are dependent on people who participate in hunting hunting is important to some parts of our communities such as my constituency and in a few areas it is crucial it will be a further blow to those rural areas if it is banneda community is not just about a physical area it is also about a community spirit many communities each with their own spirit are what make up a country i am delighted to have been present for this important debate i am glad that the government introduced it and that i have been able to participate", "it is ironic that this statement takes place in the middle of a debate about local communities as the secretary of state rightly says football clubs throughout the land are vital to communities and this is a sad situationthe secretary of state touched on the future of football but perhaps understandably concentrated on the overall impact on the digital service will she return to football and give a few more details of how exactly she is working with the fa to try to rescue the clubs will that involve the renegotiation of contracts with players or trying to get commercial support for football clubs", "the minister will be aware of the initiative taken some time ago by the labour council in coventry to create a city centre company

cooper in her seat i thank her for coming to reply i am also grateful to my hon friend the member for cotswold mr cliftonbrown and the hon member for stroud mr drew for being present they both have an interest in the debate as they represent constituencies in gloucestershirei have been applying for this debate for some time but have been unlucky in the selection procedure my desire to have the debate began on christmas day when i made my usual round of hospital visits as i am sure all hon members do my visit to my local hospital was unhappy when i arrived i discovered that a ward was closed due to a shortage of staff not even agency staff could be found on that occasion i also found a great many patients who should not have been in hospital but were waiting for nursing home places one poor chap had been waiting for six months for a place at a specialist spinal unitall hon members receive letters telling us of problems with the health service but when we go to hospitals and meet such people the problems become very real when we see the problems at first hand they have a great effect on us for example i am concerned about the oncology ward in cheltenham general hospital at which people who are in a very sickly state sometimes arrive first thing in the morning and have to wait all day for treatment as all hon members will have done i have spoken to doctors nurses scientists therapists and carers in my area who feel not only shortstaffed but extremely stretched in their work i do not want to paint too black a picture but i have become aware of those problems over the past year especially in the christmas periodi do not blame the doctors nurses or other staff or the health authority in that area the health service has national problems to which i do not want to refer too generally given that the debate focuses on gloucestershire however there are national problems with funding despite the governments claims that they are increasing funding and despite the previous conservative governments increased spending without taking into account the private sector contributions government spending on the health service puts this country ahead of luxembourg ireland finland spain portugal greece and italy however we fall way behind germany denmark france belgium sweden the netherlands and austria in that respectthere are also problems with what is known as the postcode lottery whereby drugs such as beta interferon for the treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis are prescribed in some areas and not in others people understandably find that unacceptable given that the nhs is supposed to be a national serviceone reason why problems have been made worse for the health service is that it has been the victim of its own success it has kept people relatively well and allowed them to live longer only 50 years ago there were 4 million pensioners in the country whereas now there are 11 million although i do not want it to appear as though i am blaming pensioners for the problems hon members will recognise that their greater calling on health services presents the nhs with another problem the fact that there are also new drugs new treatments and new operations has created greater demand there is also a greater public awareness and a greater expectation of public servants all those factors add to the problems of the health service i fully recognise that the gloucestershire health authority and the staff there are doing the best that they can in a difficult situationwhen i visited tewkesbury hospital on christmas day i found that delayed discharges which are unkindly known as bed blocking are a big problem i raised the matter with the prime minister and the secretary of state for health the picture in gloucestershire is bleak there was a time when gloucestershire had many nursing home places i do not want to be party political but in 1997 the county had 4047 nursing home places now it has only 3064 those figures were kindly provided by the minister in a written answer so i can only assume that the figure of 983 for the home care places that the county has lost is accurate that is a significant fallwhat are the reasons for that fall again i do not want to be party political but people have told me that they have to work to the national standards and say that other factors such as employment regulations and a shortage of staff have all added to the problem we are all aware that the situation is unfair to those waiting to be discharged from hospital their families the hospital staff and to those waiting for operations and for the beds that are unnecessarily occupied it may be a bigger problem in gloucestershire because the county has a slightly older population than some other counties i draw that to the ministers attention although i am sure that she is aware of it unfortunately over the past few weeks there has been another flurry of nursing home closures in the county which will add to the problemas i say i do not want to paint too bleak a picture because many people are trying their best to make something of the situation for instance there is a sheltered housing scheme and a hospital home care discharge scheme and the new trust will bid for development funds to provide further beds to be commissioned as and when they are wanted some initiatives are being taken but the picture is not goodi want to mention health service staffing in gloucestershire i mentioned the closed ward in tewkesbury hospital it was certainly needed staff could not be found not even agency staff to run the wards when i spoke to nurses in other hospitals in cheltenham and gloucester i was told how stretched the staff were and how shortstaffed the service was i was told that nurses are leaving the nhs to work for agencies only to be employed by the nhs at a huge extra cost no one can blame those who take advantage of that but it benefits neither patients nor the nhs budgetscientific staff carry out a vital job behind the scenes most people never come across them but they do important work they too are stretched as is the ambulance service the rurality of gloucestershire makes it difficult to provide an effective ambulance service and it is a great tribute to those who work for it that they manage to provide such a good service therapists too are stretched and we have far too few carersa great deal more is expected of public servants today not only in the health service however it applies particularly to the health service and we must consider the rewards that health service staff receive compared with what they could earn elsewhere we must also consider their conditions of work on a recent visit to the ambulance service in gloucestershire i was reminded that those who train as paramedics get very little more than those who do not i am sure that the minister will want to address that as it is a big problem if we want to provide the kind of immediate service that people want we must ensure that we have the staff to do iti also want to talk about waiting times i have been a little concerned by some letters that i have received\u2014i am sure that my hon friend the member for cotswold and the hon member for stroud share my concern\u2014about people having to wait a long time for treatment the national figures for people who wait 12 months or more are not impressive and have increased during the past four years that is reflected locally i am worried about people who have to wait for heart bypass operations they suffer from an extremely serious condition and we all know of people who have waited far too long for such operationsseveral drugs have been developed to treat serious illnesses and it is a tragedy when they are not prescribed gloucestershire was certainly not helped by the uncertainty created when the national institute for clinical excellence seemed to point in different directions on beta interferon to its credit the health authority did its best to provide funding for some patients but it was by no means enough when a serious illness could be but is not treated by a drug we have to ask what is going on and whether we have a national health service at allanother example that concerned me recently was brachytherapy a treatment with which i am not familiar i am sure that the minister will correct me if i pronounced it wrongly it is a treatment for prostate cancer that is considered to be far less traumatic and to have fewer side effects than others cheltenham has a machine for it but i am told by the gloucestershire prostate cancer brachytherapy unit trust that it needs to raise \u00a350000 a year itself during the next two years to pay for the machine to run that concerns us given that we are supposed to have a national health service the service seems rather patchy and i hope that the minister will mention that in her replysome arrangements are being introduced that i hope will improve the delivery of health services i want to draw attention to two problems one is the joint emergency services unit which will be effective in gloucestershire from next year when the three emergency teams will work together the ambulance service has told me that it wants comparative pay levels introduced if the emergency services are to work together the minister might consider that with her colleaguesnew strategic health authorities and primary care trusts will also be developed tewkesbury and cheltenham will form one of the smallest in the new strategic region i am a little concerned about that and hope that the minister will say a word or two on the subject we are trying to be as positive as we can be about the changes but we are concerned about the merging of hospital trusts we hope that it will benefit patients but we shall have to see how it worksgloucestershire is seen as an idyllic place to live\u2014a wonderful place with beautiful countryside it is a lovely place and i am sure that all those who live there are proud to do so however it has pockets of deprivation and problems caused by rurality and poor health in some areas that needs recognition all too often gloucestershire is not given the funding or the treatment by ministers that it deserves the same may apply to other shire counties as well i hope that in future simply because a county sounds beautiful to live in it will not suffer through shortage of fundingi thank the minister for listening so intently and look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say before she replies to my points", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills what recent assessment she has made of the levels of student debt on leaving university and if she will make a statement", "to ask the

arrangements", "further to that point of order mr speaker can we also take it that in future you will use your sound judgment and prevent the prime minister from misrepresenting conservative party policy when in fact he is being questioned about his governments policies", " i shall not add much to what i said earlier about the need for the windingup process to be seriously considered the customarily wideranging speech of my hon friend the member for lichfield covered many issues that concern us we are setting up a body that will have potentially important duties and a large role we need clarification on the points raised by my hon friend such as what will happen to the bodys assets the bill gives a lot of power to the secretary of state i shall not go over the ground covered by my hon friend the member for lichfield but subsection 5b provides power to make such incidental supplemental consequential and transitional provision as the secretary of state thinks fit will the minister clarify whether that will include only assets or whether it will include responsibility for regulation i am unsure what is intended and i do not mean to trip him up by asking the question  on the transfer of property liabilities rights interests and other things that are listed will the minister clarify what sort of organisation andor person those rights and obligations would be transferred to if the other regulators were no longer to exist because ofcom cannot be wound up until beyond 2003 we must assume that the other regulators will not exist ", " the minister seems to have skipped over one of my questions after 2003 it is likely that no regulator will remain other than ofcom to whom would he envisage transferring assets and responsibility under those circumstances", " the minister is trying to be helpful is he saying that the secretary of state will not have the power to wind up ofcom after existing regulators have been abolished", " i too would prefer to speak on clause stand part if you allowed that mr gale so my comments now will be brief under the bill it will be quicker and easier to wind up ofcom than to set it up my concern is the possibility that other regulations may not be in place when that occurs which would cause confusion and mayhem to regulation of the industry for that reason the winding up of ofcom deserves more than just an order before the house i shall expand on those words if we have a stand part debate ", " i rise to make a brief contribution i cannot follow my hon friend in his colour and extravagance and his detailed knowledge of what we are discussing is to be admired especially when he has just received such terrible news which i have just seen and when he had such a good night last night i too am rather confused by clause 4 at the risk of becoming monotonous through repetition i regret that the government have tried to do something that we do not disagree with as a whole in two bills rather than in one that adds to the potential for confusion and the potential to fail to set up ofcom in the way that we want  i am concerned about the continuing absence of any guarantee about when the main communications bill will be introduced i mention that again because it leaves a big gap if we go down the route suggested in clause 4 whereby existing regulators must do this and that and ofcom must do this but not that and so on and so forth and if there is a long time until the main bill is published we shall run into difficulties especially in an industry that changes so quickly i am confused clause 21 refers to the implementation of or for securing the modification of any relevant proposals about the regulation of communications however clause 41c seems to give the same requirements and powers to the existing regulators is there potential for conflict my hon friend the member for lichfield who has temporarily left his place\u2014i had better not go into the detailed reasons for that\u2014mentioned the possibility of the existing regulators being muzzled i do not know whether the provisions will muzzle them or do the opposite\u2014give them the powers to determine the shape of ofcom i have concerns about that  clause 4\u2014especially subsection 1b c and d and subsection 5\u2014seems to pass some duties from the existing regulators to ofcom but to keep others i detect potential for great confusion which i do not want i want a very smooth transition the white paper correctly identified that the staffing of ofcom and the quality of staff would be allimportant if there is to be a protracted period of transition any confusion will serve only to undermine the position and perhaps the employment prospects of current staff  it is important that the government make clear the time scale which i have mentioned before they must also clear up some of the confusion that to my mind surrounds clause 4 about which my hon friends the members for vale of york and for lichfield spoke at much greater length and with more eloquence than i have sought to do ", " does the minister consider that the final words as ofcom considers appropriate weaken the clause i know that the research paper is not an official document but it says that the clause does not appear to limit ofcom very much since it has only to follow the general guidance on public bodies as it considers appropriate", "to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport 1  how many lottery grant applications were made by organisations in gloucestershire broken down by parliamentary

debate even though it draws us away from our constituency engagements on a friday for me that is unusual but this is such an important debate that it is a privilege to take part in it especially given the tone of the discussion so far hon members may put different emphasis on different policies but everybody in the house wants to see the same outcomes and we have already heard some thoughtful speechesas the minister would expect i want to talk about special educational needs in the overall context of what we have to do to prevent people from being excluded from society the white paper like the debate so far acknowledges that many people are excluded from society through no fault of their ownbefore i entered the house my main occupation was in the textile industry and in manufacturing but for four or five years immediately before i came here i did a lot of charity work and fundraising some of it on a professional basis one of my roles immediately before i was elected was working with homeless women in londonthat was an eyeopener and also in some ways a useful introduction to the house of commons because the people with whom we were dealing had severe problems and were excluded from society it is interesting to note that the people who wanted to help them came from what could be described as the elite and the job stretched my abilities\u2014and i should add my education\u2014in every direction that was a useful preparation for coming to the house because when we deal with our constituents we often get stretched in many directionswhat struck me particularly at that time was the prevalence of mental illness and the way in which it affected people my role was to raise money to create a hostel for homeless women in london and that was successfully done the home took in homeless people and resettled them but it was not simply a matter of putting someone in a home and then finding them a flat we had to get people to try to understand why they had become homeless in the first place and to deal with the problems that had caused that when we got them into their own home again we had to continue to work with them to ensure that they did not have further problemsmany of those people had mental illnesses they were not necessarily young people some were older and some were refugees they came from all walks of lifeone of the common factors was that those people had never been rich they were obviously quite poor that does not mean that rich people do not have mental illnesses or become homeless they certainly do i became aware of many quite welloff people who had mental illnesses and had become homeless but they were shielded from the glare of publicity and did not become obvious to us or to the rest of society because they had friends who could look after themmany people with learning disabilities and mental illnesses do not have such friends and they end up in hostels or on the streets with severe problems that taught me a thing or two about what is going on in society\u2014both what we see and what we do not see my work had a profound effect on mewhen i entered the house i like many other members was asked to make one or two speeches on crime and i began to think about the massive changes that had taken place in the 20th century the rise in crime was pretty constant during that century and on the face of it it is difficult to correlate social factors with that rise in crime the provision of health care education and housing was far better at the end of the 20th century than at the beginning and there was far more prosperity so i began to ask myself why if all those social factors had improved had crime increased so tremendously during that centuryi came to two conclusions one was that attitudes had changed the world had changed and people were not taught to tell right from wrong as they once were however to say that is to oversimplify it also became clear that there was a group of people who probably had not shared in the great improvements and advances of the century\u2014people who had not got much better health care or education and were not much better off", "my hon friend is right and has picked up a point that i was going to makeif we think about the people who have not shared in the great advances of the 20th century we begin to understand why things have gone wrong for some people i do not of course mean to suggest that everybody in that category ends up as a criminal that is obviously not true and i do not think that anybody in the house would assume that that is what i am sayingas i continued to study crime and the prison population i found that as my hon friend says about 60 per cent of the prison population are either illiterate or semiilliterate again i am not saying that anyone who is illiterate will automatically commit a crime but there is a reason to look more deeply for the causes of crimei am not saying that all prison sentences are strong enough indeed i think that many of them should be stronger none the less we need to understand why the crimes are committed in the first place there is an obvious correlation between the crime figures and a lack of education and basic skills i was astounded when i checked up on this because i could not believe the figures but i found that more than 90 per cent of prisoners have some form of mental illness or other mental problemthose problems fall into five different categories but most prisoners\u2014indeed almost all prisoners\u2014have some form of what used to be called mental deficiency i hesitate to use that term but do so in the absence of a better one there is a great problem yes we must address sentencing policy but that is a matter for another debate in this debate we must examine why people end up in that position when we allegedly have an education system that prevents thatmany people leave school either illiterate or semiliterate that is a factor in crime and social exclusion todays world is extremely competitive in that respect the world has changed more in the past 20 years than in the preceding 80 years i have the pleasure of being a member of the standing committee on the office of communications bill in which we are discussing the massive changes that have taken place not only in television programmes but through the emergence of the internetthe changes in the world and the pace with which they have taken place are incredible now only the strong survive\u2014but in a civilised society we must do better than that people who are not properly educated will be disadvantaged and excluded from society to some extent we have to ensure not only that they have some way of making up ground but\u2014more important\u2014that they do not fall by the wayside and become involved in crime or drugs that is a big challengethere is a problem of acceptance i hope that i will be allowed to take a gentle swipe at politicians perhaps even those of my own party there has been a reluctance to accept that people who are not well educated and who therefore have no job or are caught up in the dependency culture are more likely to fall by the wayside and to turn to crime the problem is that that is regarded as an excuse for crime it is not an excuse many people in the same circumstances do not turn to crime however it sometimes serves as an explanation and as a reason to look deeperi am glad that the shadow home secretary my hon friend the member for west dorset mr letwin has recently opened up that debate and i applaud him for doing so he made it quite clear\u2014", "i certainly shall madam deputy speaker and i apologise for strayingmy point is that learning disabilities or mental illness are often not recognised physical illness is much more easily recognised than mental illness that failure to recognise and address the issues might be because of the stigma that attached to mental illness in the past or because we find it frightening to talk about or because we find the people who suffer mental illness rather challengingsome of the problems that children have such as autism dyslexia and dyspraxia\u2014an illness i came across only recently\u2014are not recognised and identified quickly enough and not dealt with properly the result is that many children through no fault of their own but because of their learning disabilities do not receive the education that they deservethe need to provide education to such children brings me to the issue of special educational needs with my hon friend the member for daventry mr boswell and the minister who was then at the department for education and skills i had the pleasure to serve on the committee that considered the special educational needs and disability act 2001 although we welcomed much of its content certain aspects of that legislation caused me concernthe legislation emphasised inclusion which in theory i applaud but when that inclusion in education does not provide for the child that child becomes excluded from society later the legislation was rather prescriptive stating that the child had to be educated in a mainstream school unless there was an appropriate statement and even if there was a statement the child had to be educated in the mainstream unless that wasincompatible with the wishes of his parent or    the provision of efficient education for other childrenthe emphasis was on inclusionmany children especially those with moderate learning difficulties are included and do very well in mainstream schools however in my opinion many children with moderate or more severe learning difficulties\u2014perhaps with emotional and behavioural difficulties\u2014need special provision the 2001 act was not helpful in that respect\u2014in fact it was rather destructivemy remarks are founded on my experience in gloucestershire which for the avoidance of doubt is run these days by an unholy liblab alliance or pact as it used to be called i make that point lest people think that gloucestershire is run by the conservatives it has not been for a long time i am greatly concerned about education policy in gloucestershire i am not the only one concerned about special educational needs provision a damning ofsted report was published in januaryinappropriate education can lead to exclusion even though the intention is to include although it might be regarded as inclusive to educate all children in one school if some children fall behind because they cannot cope with that education they will end up excluded from society the theory will not work in practice many pupils and parents in gloucestershire are concerned about the removal of the special schoolsthe minister dealing with the 2001 act said repeatedly that the act and government policy at that time should not lead to the wholesale closure of special schools but gloucestershire county council decided otherwise and that it should close the special schools bownham park school in stroud was earmarked for closure parents pupils and everyone else connected with the school ran a tremendous campaign to keep it open unfortunately the adjudicator decided that the school should close with the decision being announced the day after the general election that is not a political point it is a factthat was extremely sad not only for those involved in that school but for many other teachers and head teachers throughout the mainstream sector they recognise that regardless of the good intentions of any government historically resources have never followed pupils mainstream schools have never had adequate resources to provide the support required by children with special needsthe council has not learned the lesson this morning i received an email telling me that gloucestershires cabinet has now raised closure notices on dean hall school and oakdene school in forest of dean oakdene provides for children with severe learning difficulties the hon member for forest of dean diana organ is to present to the cabinet a petition carrying 5000 signatures protesting against the closures although we hear from the government that their policies are not intended to lead to the wholesale closure of special schools in gloucestershire\u2014the area that i am paid to represent\u2014there is a programme of wholesale closure of special schoolsthe one special school that falls in my constituency alderman knight school has sent a delegation to the house of commons and run a tremendous campaign to try to protect itself not only do pupils at that school have learning disabilities as described in the white paper but they have physical disabilities as well it is extremely difficult for those children to be educated in mainstream schools the minister will be tired of hearing me make this plea but i urge the government to reexamine their policy of inclusioni do not want the house to think that it is only my opinion that provision for special educational needs is not working well in gloucestershire paragraph 5 of the ofsted report describes the background in gloucestershire and statesagainst this generally favourable background the lea has serious weaknessesone of the serious weaknesses listed is the strategy for special educational needs the process that i have been describing is one such reason for the ofsted reports criticismlooking in more detail at the section in the ofsted report on special educational needs one paragraph saysthe strategy is to promote inclusion by educating pupils with moderate learning difficulties in mainstream schools and as a consequence closing the area special schools providing for these pupilsagain we find that the policy is leading to the wholesale closure of such schools the report continuesthe closure of the special school in the first area to be tackled was only achieved after the intervention of the office of the schools adjudicator in the remaining three areas there is confusion in the schools and among parents as to whether the closure of special schools or a change of status is being considered    as a result of the slow process the special schools towards the end of the cycle of the review fear that it will become increasingly difficult to recruit staff maintain pupil numbers and ensure that the pupils curricula needs are metscare stories lead to staff disappearing which then leads to falling roll numbers then people can turn round and say that there is no demand for the services of such schools\u2014but we all know that there isthe report goes on to saydespite the existence of the development plan most of the schools visited had no confidence that the members of the council have a strategy for the future of special educational needs provision in the leathat means that because the schools are earmarked for closure but there is not an adequate replacement policy the resources will not follow the pupils into mainstream schools the report goes on to make another pointmost serious of all although the documentation makes constant references to inclusion and facilitating access it fails to show how its proposed changes will raise the standards of achievement of pupils with special educational needsthat is the crucial point in other words we are talking about theories and not setting out how the standards of achievement of pupils with special educational needs will be attainedhighlighting the problem further the report goes on to sayin addition to the extensive special educational needs provision within the county\u2014of which i am proud\u2014the lea maintains a number of pupils in outofcounty placements the total number has reduced    but the number of pupils whose placements are joint funded with the social services department has doubled very few of these pupils need to go to schools outofcounty for educational reasons rather\u2014this is the crucial point\u2014they are placed outside because of inadequate respite fostering or residential arrangements within the countythe report recommends that the lea needs towork with health authorities and the countys social services department to reduce the number of cases where exceptional needs prevent the completion of special educational needs statements within 18 weeksthe statementing situation is obviously of great concern i fear that you will call me to order if i go down that road madam deputy speaker so suffice it to say that the approach is rather one size fits all which we want to try to avoidin general i welcome the fact that the white paper addresses the difficulties caused to many people by the fact that they have learning disabilities whatever that means\u2014the definition is quite wide i have tried to highlight one or two areas where people can fall by the wayside end up homeless or perhaps committing crime or are excluded from society even if they are not homeless or criminals i hope that the white paper will address those issues i hope that it is also able to identify ways in which we can put things righti did not go to a grammar school because as i have said before in the house i failed to negotiate the 11plus successfully i went to a secondary modern school i make that point only because i went to the school appropriate for me it provided me with the appropriate education so i would not want people for the sake of the theory of inclusivity to be excluded from society that is the plea that i yet again make to the minister with whom i have some sympathy because even though she has changed departments she still has to suffer my pleas", " my hon friend makes a good point as he has several times today if ofcom is to take the lead in regulation it is not clear in the bill i am not entirely sure who should regulate\u2014laughter labour members laugh at that but from the white paper and the bill it seems that the government are not sure who should regulate they say that the two organisations should discuss it the laughter is a little unkind", " the hon gentleman makes a strong point that the regulatory authority with the expertise in a particular industry should be the one to regulate but i am not entirely sure that that is the case do we want to protect the industry or the consumer if the consumer perhaps people from the industry should not regulate competition", " i agree the lack of clarity is the reason why the amendments were tabled unfortunately i must be here tomorrow although i know that other hon members may not have to be i therefore conclude my remarks", " on a point of order mr gale i am not aware that any opposition member was informed that the committee would sit until 525 pm", " i wish to speak briefly to amendments nos 61 and 62 the objectives for setting up ofcom are simplification which i will come back to in a moment standards in broadcasting and protection of the public we discussed standards at some length earlier today when we talked about decency and good taste i would be called to order if i restarted the discussion however we must consider the influence that the media has on the public it influences perceptions of good or bad taste and decency or indecency but it also has an overall influence perhaps of a political or religious nature that is one reason why we need regulation and rules and laws on competition  i speak from bitter personal experience\u2014perhaps all hon members can\u2014of undue media influence which can damage ones career one part of the media may pursue someone who they have something against or someone who belongs to a group that they wish to embarrass let us say that a newspaper is pursuing an individual if several newspapers are under the same ownership they can network and use local bases they can snoop into every article that the individual has written for the local press and publicise them in the national press we must be conscious of  the great power held by such media groups and examine it closely i am pleased that the white paper discusses the issue in some detail  however we must also be fair to the industry the white paper says that this bill and the next one will have to strike a balance between creating a free and open society and protecting the public from undue influence bad taste and indecency i hope that we will be able to shape the legislation into that form as i have often said i believe in a free society but not necessarily in a libertarian one there is a difference  in talking about regulation we must be conscious of a point that i have raised many times although i fear that i will be called to order if i go too deeply into it we need to look at the position of the bbc with regard to regulation and competition i do not understand how the bbc can be considered a fair competitor in the marketplace when nonconsumers have to pay the licence fee how can that be considered fair free or competitive ", " i have touched on one of the many subjects close to my hon friends heart", " i said that i was fearful of being called to order in the event my hon friend was called to order i led him down the wrong path and i apologise to him he can perhaps tell me later the point that he was going to make i shall move on but i want to emphasise before doing so that if we are to have competition it is important that all members of the media are treated in the same way i had thought that simplification was an objective of the bill the white paper describes what it terms a concurrency between regulators in other industries but we are concerned that under the bill ofcom will seem to be responsible to two departments it is true that we are privileged to have two government whips from different departments the opposition do not have sufficient numbers to provide two whips this particular whip\u2014i refer of course to myself\u2014has to work particularly hard as hon members will have noted we are concerned that ofcom will have to report to two different departments we are supposed to be simplifying the process ", " i agree it is important to have clarity on that and i thought that we were trying to clear up confusion it seems uncertain and confusing to have two organisations that in effect have responsibility for competition and deciding between themselves which one will look at which individual case the white paper statesofcom and the oft will consult each other in any particular case which falls within this concurrent jurisdiction and will agree which is best placed to act i am sure that my hon friend the member for vale of york did not exactly copy the white paper in drafting the amendments but the wording of amendment no 62 including cooperating with the office of fair trading on matters relating to the promotion of open and competitive markets in effect quotes the objective of that part of the white paper i am sure that the minister will not resist the amendment ", " by no means could i attempt to speak as eloquently or in as much detail as my hon friend the member for esher and walton mr taylor who has taught me an awful lot in the space of just a few minutes i want to emphasise the importance to television of the independent sector thinking back to when i was young i remember all sorts of programmes being broadcast through that sector in different regions emmerdale coronation street and eastenders they are all household names despite my earlier comments about good taste and decency it is important that at least some of those programmes continue  i am concerned about the future of the independent sector in the sense that it seems that the bbc will be regulated somewhat differently from itv we have heard a great deal from my hon friends about the difficulties faced by independent companies we must remember that they are not funded by the anonymous taxpayer they have to generate their own income which puts them on a very different footing that is a serious consideration in terms of regulation  the white paper contains a great deal about the future of independent broadcasting on the one hand  that makes me feel confident about its future on the other it seems a little woolly and vague will the minister add a little more certainty  my hon friend the member for lichfield made his points far more colourfully than i could hope to do if i am in a position to do so i shall ensure that he serves on the committee that considers the main communications bill because it would not be the same without him i am sure that members of the committee will agree about that if nothing else  independent companies need to be able to plan ahead but the white paper has a lot to say about the ownership of different media in the future for that ragbag of reasons i support the amendment ", " my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant was accused of not knowing what the minister was talking about that could be applied to all of us because although the minister started to specify time scales they still seem uncertain i gave an analogy when mr stevenson was in the chair which i hope you will allow me to repeat mr gale i declared an interest in the horse racing industry the former home secretary the right hon member for blackburn mr straw gave an assurance two or three years ago that the status of the tote and the levy system would be changed responsibilities have been transferred to the department for culture media and sport and the industry still awaits legislation even though we are now in a different parliament  that industry has been thrown into chaos because of delay the last thing we want is the communications industry to be thrown into similar chaos the minister said that that will depend on the parliamentary  timetable but we have been told that matters raised by opposition members are irrelevant because they will be in the main bill which will begin in spring\u2014a debate followed about what spring meant i am not entirely satisfied by the ministers considerate response so i will press the amendment to a division  question put that the amendment be madethe committee divided ayes 5 noes 11", " i hope that you will allow me a small analogy mr stevenson is my hon friend aware of a promise made to the horseracing industry that regulations would be introduced on the tote and the levy board the absence of that legislation has thrown the industry into chaos the home office made the original promise when racing fell under its remit but it now falls under that of the department for culture media and sport", " i do not mean to trip the minister up but he and his hon friends talk about a lighter regulatory touch he was kind enough to say that he agreed with me and with my hon friend the member for upminster about the promotion of decency and good taste how will those objectives be achieved they seem to be slightly contradictory", " i am grateful to the minister for explaining his position he will forgive me if i suggest that he was slightly vague on some areas particularly on the point that i raised a moment ago i would also have liked to hear him detail the size of staff that he envisages ofcom having in its shell form i have some concerns about the transfer of staff from the existing regulators to ofcom he seemed to suggest that the setting up of ofcom and the publication of the draft bill might be synchronised would there be a gradual or a sudden transfer of staff or duties we have given these matters a strong airing i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment ", " i beg to move amendment no 14 in page 2 line 24 at end insert\u20141a the functions conferred upon ofcom under this section shall have effect only for a period of one year following its commencement", " i must apologise for my hon friend the member for vale of york whose absence is unavoidable due to her select committee duties i envisage her return soon so i do not intend to speak for long we are concerned about how long ofcom is likely to exist in its present form the government gave a commitment that there would be some form of sunset clause so that ofcom could not run on for ever the minister has mentioned the new communications bill and there has been some debate about when spring actually is my hon friend the member for vale of york said that sometimes spring does not arrive in north yorkshire till august whereas in some parts of the country it arrives a little earlier we are very vague and unsure about when the new bill will be introduced the minister said a moment ago that he might not wish to work on the main bill i hope that he does he deserves it i hope that i too will be fortunate enough to retain my position and be on the main bill because i have greatly enjoyed our debates on this bill of which there are more to come ", " perhaps it will benefit the committee if i say that the power and influence of the whips office is not what it is assumed to be nor what it was as there are no guarantees about costs or staff size we want to ensure that the shell ofcom does not run on for too long and that it does not become confused about its role as earlier debates made clear we are not sure whether it is to have any regulatory role we know that it will not regulate but clause 21 suggests that it will have some involvement in regulation especially in discussing modification of proposals how long will that run on for as my hon friend said we have five regulators at the moment and it might be said that when the bill is enacted we will have six we have proposed a sunset clause to ensure that spring does not extend beyond this spring or indeed spring next year i do not want to say any more about the amendment i am sure that my hon friends and other hon members will have a lot to say ", " on a point of order mr stevenson the statement that the bill will come forward as soon as possible is not particularly precise", " i rise briefly to address points that may already have been covered i want to return to a point that i made earlier but i will not test hon members patience i can make my point at third reading if i catch the speakers eye i have expressed concern that there are two bills when everything could have been put into one ofcom could have been set up on 1 march with its regulatory powers to be taken on 1 august that would have been better and clearer however ofcom is being set up without anyone knowing what it will do or what powers it will assume my hon friend the member for esher and walton touched on some important issues when he said that clause 21 referred to the regulation of communications and the implementation of or for securing the modification of any relevant proposals about the regulation of communications that leaves the role of ofcom potentially wide and certainly vague ", " i had not seen that article but my hon friend raises a good point we are uncertain as to the role of ofcom because we do not know what will be in the main bill although the white paper is an interesting and comprehensive document it does not make up the main bill nor does it go into detail about what the bill will state my hon friend the member for vale of york who has had to leave the committee for a few minutes to attend a select committee referred to uncertainty about staffing the committee has accepted that it is important for ofcom to attract the best staff\u2014every organisation wants to do so\u2014and it may expect to attract the best staff from existing regulators however there is uncertainty because we do not know what ofcom will do i do not know whether my hon friends share my concern but it seems uncertain whether staff would be persuaded to leave existing regulators to join a body when they do not know what that body will be doing  my hon friend also referred to costs the amendments would require ofcom to identify opportunities for cost savings and it is fair to put that in the bill  we have heard a lot about taste and decency\u2014you would call me to order mr stevenson\u2014if i went too far into that but the matter concerns me i fully accept that with the proliferation of channels and the advent of the internet it is difficult to control what is available in addition what is decent is a matter of opinion what is tasteful is even more a matter of opinion we have a duty to protect young people and children particularly  we do not live in a totally libertarian society i believe in a free society in which individual freedom is important but i do not believe in total libertarianism in which for example people take drugs i do not accept that drugtaking should be part of society even when it is peoples personal choice because they can become caught up in a culture that is undesirable people can be unduly influenced by what they see on television many believe that what they see on television is real life that coronation street exists and that they can go to the rovers return although it is difficult we should make an attempt to control bad taste and indecency on television screens ", " thank you for your guidance mr stevenson i am grateful for the helpful intervention from the hon member for rhondda and for his sympathy with the broad thrust of my comments it is incumbent on any organisation to ensure that its services provide good value for money which is what we are driving at in the amendment we are also concerned with taste and decency we live in a free society and i would always argue for the retention of that but we must always be concerned about the way in which people are influenced by the media i suggest that that influence is increasing with more channels and the internet there is greater potential influence over people by the communications industry i accept that regulation is difficult but that is no reason to shy away from it most of the things that are worth achieving in life are difficult to achieve we are worried about the vagueness of clause 2 which seems to be openended without specifying what ofcom should do the amendment whether perfectly drafted or not seeks to bring a little more discipline to ofcom i hope that when the minister responds he will respond not just to my comments but to those of my hon friend the member for vale of york ", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what assessment she has made of the losses incurred by farmers through the otms due to restrictions on movements during the foot and mouth epidemic", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry what support she is providing to industry for the development of renewable forms of energy and if she will make a statement", "to ask the secretary of state for trade and industry if she will make a statement on the development of the oldbury nuclear power station", " much that i meant to say has been said so i shall be brief if it is important for ofcom to exist before the main bill has been considered and we know what it will do it is important to establish the consumer panel alongside it as my hon friend the member for vale of york said through this bill we are establishing the structure of ofcom which will deal with as yet unknown matters the structure is important i have said many times that the main interests to be looked after by ofcom are those of the consumers we need to protect the interests of industry because it employs many people and is important but the impact of ofcom on consumers is even more important the influence of the media on children young people and even older people cannot be underestimated so we need to achieve as the white paper says a balance between  freedom decency and quality however who decides how and whether that balance is achieved we need a strong consumer panel for that  a consumer panel could consider the standards of programmes and the decency on television screens but it could also look at the proliferation of the internet telephone masts and mobile telephones at safety aspects and at a great many other elements to convince hon members that a useful service is being served by considering the bill i ask the minister not to wait for the main bill we are setting up something that is important and to their credit the government give great coverage in the white paper to the importance of setting up a consumer council we will establish a new consumer panel to advise the regulator that seems clear so let us have the details now ", " whether or not the last amendment was made surely the sum going to ofcom is open ended it is open ended in the clause either way is not the need for the public accounts committee to consider the issue proved if i may put a second point briefly we keep hearing government members say that there should be light regulatory control\u2014but has not yet been established because we have not heard from ministers what ofcom will do", " i was going to rise anyway but i should like to pick up the point made by the hon member for hampstead and highgate the experience\u2014mentioned in amendment no 21\u2014that we ask of the people who sit on ofcom is drawn not from sitting on the ofcom board but as my hon friend the member for lichfield said from working in the real world it is important to represent not necessarily the regional television companies but the regional television consumers there is logic in listing the areas from which people should draw expertise and in saying that they should not serve on ofcom for too long the fact that it is a rapidly changing world particularly in communications and the media reinforces the point if people serve on ofcom for too long\u2014certainly if they do so full time\u2014they are effectively out of the industry and not in it they will be regulating it but they will not be involved in it i do not agree with my hon friend the member for lichfield if he is suggesting that members of parliament should be restricted to two terms the electorate can if they like restrict us to one term  countries such as the united states of which my hon friend has far greater experience than i limit their presidents to two terms surely that is up to the electorate to decide and i notice that one or two countries are moving away from that constitutional arrangement however it is appropriate in this case there are no elections to the board and the appointments will be made by the secretary of state the amendment and the previous one that we tabled are quite consistent ", " i am tempted to open my remarks by saying follow that if anyone says in future that committee work is boring i shall refer them to my hon friend in spite of being called to order three times\u2014although you thought it was only twice miss widdecombe\u2014he made some valuable points as did the hon member for milton keynes northeast the amendment has value because it addresses the confusion that seems to surround regulation which might be cleared up if the people appointed to ofcom had the expertise as listed my hon friend the member for lichfield mentioned religious broadcasting for example i do not have his experience\u2014nor do i have a house in america as he does\u2014so i bow to his greater knowledge it is odd that some things can be broadcast in this country that cause great offence to many people when under the broadcasting act 1990 it is illegal for a religious organisation to own a national radio licence in their white paper the government say that religious content has a capacity to offend that may be so but many other things on television and radio have an enormous capacity to offend so i do not know why the distinction is made i do not blame the government for that distinction as the act in question was passed in 1990 however they seem reluctant to address the issue if we take the white paper as a guide  confusion also surrounds regional broadcasting the white paper says that under the belfast agreement there is an obligation to achieve in northern ireland more widespread availability of a television company known as tg4 which is based in the irish republic if the white paper sees fit to draw attention to that regional aspect\u2014the need to introduce a foreign broadcasting company to the viewers and listeners of the united kingdom\u2014there must surely be a need to consider regional television in general  i shall not add to what has been said on mobile phones although a great deal of confusion exists as to the effects on health of phones and phone masts that confusion needs addressing and i am glad that the government have set up a further investigation as i and other hon members have asked questions on that subject confusion surrounds that issue too and i would welcome any input that members of ofcom might be able to give  as for the internet my hon friend the member for lichfield suggested that it would be impossible to regulate it i hope that i am not paraphrasing him too much but i believe that that was what he said i accept that there will be difficulties but if the internet grows and takes over from television as it may do\u2014although i do not have the expertise to know whether that is likely\u2014we must find a way in which to regulate it if it is as easily accessible to 10yearold children as television is there may be a need to regulate it ", " my hon friend makes a good point i am not sure what the rules and regulations are about television programmes made abroad again there seems to be some confusion in that respect i base that statement on advice that i have taken from the house of commons library and on parliamentary questions that i have tabled the inclusion of the amendment would be helpful other hon members have said why that would be the case my point is that it would help to clear up some confusions and irregularities ", " i shall try to help my hon friend who has been so helpful to me is he referring to united christian broadcasters", " not yet", " when considering this group of amendments it is important to ask what the bill is supposed to do the white paper begins by stating that it is supposed tosafeguard the interests of    consumers i understood also that the bill was designed to provide a united regulatory body if so it seems odd that paragraph 14 of the schedule in effect bars anyone who is or has been a governor of the bbc from sitting on ofcom it lists several people who would not be barred but past or present governors of the bbc are not included our amendment would simply add such people to that provision which seems sensible  the government have told us several times that we must wait and see what is in the communications bill that will set the scene if that bill is so important and this one so unimportant why are we taking up parliamentary time debating it when we ought to be attending to many other matters it is important that we discuss the paving bill and get the framework right that framework should include the bbc there is in this country a mishmash of regulation one of the reasons for the bill is to bring that regulation together  the bbc is given a licence fee someone who wants to watch another channel still has to pay for the licence that is an extremely peculiar arrangement i cannot think of another example ", " i used to think that the hon gentleman was a friend of mine yet he devastates my argument just like that he makes a powerful point about the acceptance of statecontrolled broadcasting although there are several differences between paying local taxes and the paying bbcs licence fee one of which relates to ability to pay we are trying to create an environment in which competition is all important the white paper states competition is vital to dynamic markets i therefore do not see how the licence fee can be justified i am aware of a court case\u2014it was not widely reported\u2014in which someone said that she did not watch the bbc and so would not pay the licence the case went to court but was dropped because it was difficult to prove that the woman had an obligation to pay for the licence i am saying not that the result would be the same in the high court but simply that a case was dropped in court against someone who said i do not watch the bbc so you cannot require me to pay the licence fee  it would be interesting if someone brought another case using the human rights act 1998 although i do not intend to be the person who says that he does not watch the bbc and therefore will not pay the licence i am not suggesting that the bbc licence fee should be scrapped and the system reorganised\u2014you would rule me out of order miss widdecombe if i went too far down that road however i see no reason not to take this opportunity to regulate the bbc in the same way as all the other channels  the argument that the hon member for sheffield hallam advanced on media ownership was interesting and raised some relevant points although it went slightly wide of the issue it is dangerous for the  government to own media although some would argue that they do not own the bbc leaving aside the board of governors it is the secretary of state who is responsible for the bbc it could be said therefore that the government exercise strong control over the bbc whichever party is in power if we are to preserve the bbcs independence we must bring the bbc under independent control ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for yet another helpful intervention\u2014perhaps i should have left him in the select committee in another place lord lipsey argued the only outfit outside the bbc which has any powers over it is the secretary of state an elected politician he    determines its charter the level of its licence fee what new channels it may launch and who chairs it there is no accountability other than to a politician i do not see why the bbc is so adamant that ofcom should be kept at bay as a way of preserving its independence while apparently accepting that a party politician should have so much power over what it does\u2014official report house of lords 15 october 2001 vol 627 c 426 that puts it rather neatly lord eatwell said we do not want state radio in this county yet that is exactly the slippery slope down which the absence of independent regulation is pushing the bbc the creation of ofcom by the bill provides the government and the bbc with a means of escaping from that dilemma\u2014official report house of lords 15 october 2001 vol 627 c 445 the white paper says that we should create competition but it must be fair the argument is a little like that about free trade and fair trade which are two different things if we are to have competition it must be fair competition it was said in another place that it would be rather strange if ofcom had the power to fine recalcitrant commercial broadcasters but not the bbc that would indeed be odd  our amendments will not tie the secretary of states hands when designing the main bill we are simply making the reasonable suggestion that anyone who is or has been a bbc governor should not be excluded from sitting on ofcom ", "to ask the secretary of state for education and skills if she will make

concentrate on looking after the interests of the consumer i say that in support of the hon member for ceredigioni hope that i said that right having practised all morning the hon member for milton keynes northeast consistently stressed the telecommunications aspect of the bill that is fair enough but that part of the industry currently has only a limited influence on children and vulnerable people other than through internet he is wrong to accuse conservative members of being overconcerned about media effects on the consumer they need to be considered that brings me back to my main point consumers interests must come first over and above those of the industry  i had wondered why northern ireland was not mentioned in the amendments but i have received a satisfactory explanation from the hon member for ceredigion ", " that is the very point we do not know what ofcoms role will be", " the amendments are important because they largely shape the makeup of ofcom without straying on to the next group of amendments\u2014you would rightly call me to order if i did so miss widdecombe\u2014we must understand that the amendments under discussion are important if the next group are to remain so the provisions are restrictive in some ways we should remember how important the media are it is not exaggerating to suggest that children\u2014perhaps children and adults\u2014are greatly influenced by what they see on television and to a lesser extent hear on radio the question of whether regulations should be a guiding light as the minister suggests or show the heavy hand of regulation is significant we cannot overstate the importance of what comes through our  television screens how do we prevent the wrong things from coming through and ensure that the right things do  like many other hon members i receive many letters and representations on what people deem to be inappropriate material on television people often ask me how we can stop too much sex violence and bad language on television my response is that it is difficult because we live in a free society and a democracy i say that one thing worse than a free media is one that is heavily regulated the problem is how to protect people from bad influences without curtailing the freedom of the press or media  it strikes me that the bill achieves the worst of both worlds it may not reflect the interests of the many groups addressed in the next group of amendments but at the same time it has the potential for extreme regulation and control by the secretary of state who will determine ofcoms size the detail of the bill suggests that the board will not necessarily be restricted to between three and six but that the secretary of state will have powers to modify by order the numbers specified in subsection 2 presumably she could determine that the number be reduced to two or even one if i am wrong the minister will correct me my reading of the bill is that the secretary of state could make the matter worse through statutory instrument she could have only one person to make up ofcom i should be glad to be corrected because it is an extremely important point something would have to be passed by the house but we have seen how easy that is when a government have a majority of this size ", " it gives the secretary of state even more power than opposition members have discussed and i am concerned about that", " the hon member for ceredigion\u2014which i do not enjoy saying\u2014makes an important point although regulation of the media is important it is perhaps not quite as important as the supply of water as my hon friend the member for vale of york said to appoint members to the new body and to frame its setup when we do not know what its powers will be seems a little like putting the cart before the horse if i am allowed a brief analogy before we determine who sits in the house of lords or how they get there we should determine what that body does in the same  way we should determine what the new body does before we decide who sits on it it may have little regulatory power in which case it does not matter who or how many sit on it but if it is to have great control over what comes through the media we must first know what its power will be i fear that i shall stray out of order if i carry on down that road  i have a problem with the power that the bill gives to the secretary of state i do not want to be party political but over the past four and a half years we have seen the executive taking more and more control over this place to stray slightly wider i suggest that it has not just been in the past five years there has been a tendency over a number of years for the executive to gain control over this place at the expense of parliament i greatly regret that the bill furthers that process it gives the secretary of state the power to decide the size of the body and to vary the parameters it gives her the power to reflect her interests and intentions rather than those of consumers which is not a welcome move ", " the hon gentleman has made the point that we are trying to make in the sense that one is not enough but nor is three when media and telecommunications are being lumped together", " i entirely agree with my hon friend my concern is the power that the bill could give to the secretary of state the government will almost determine what comes on to television screens the regulation could be too tight and political debate could be stifled or it could be too liberal in the sense that the three things that i do not like to see on the television screen\u2014sex violence and bad language\u2014could be given free rein", " does not a family have a right to watch television without seeing filth to say that one can simply turn the television off is if i may say so a rather flippant remark no doubt it was meant flippantly\u2014", " i apologise for being diverted from the theme of my speech which is that the secretary of state will have far too much power as was pointed out a larger body would be less likely to be influenced by the secretary of state we will discuss in due course the individual organisations and interests that should be represented on it so i shall not stray down that path now however i think it important that we accept the amendments to facilitate the level of representation that the subjects importance warrants", " will the hon lady give way", " surely the committee can distinguish between the reporting of say the war in afghanistan and the gratuitous violence sex and bad language that is broadcast in so many programmes there is a very clear distinction between the two", " the hon gentleman has touched on several groups whose interests should be represented the people to whom he has inadvertently not referred but i am sure that he will are the vast majority who do not fall within any of those categories they may be termed the silent majority they are dismayed by what they see on their television screens and deserve representation", " the concern is not only that three people could be unsympathetic towards a group but that the secretary of state could be similarly unsympathetic and that his selection of those three might reflect his lack of sympathy", " does my hon friend agree that as the secretary of state has so much power in appointing people to be able to

places in gloucestershire now there is a severe shortage whom does the prime minister blame for the crisis hon members you does he blame his own governments regulations or does he blame the liblab

to represent our constituents i am aware that there is some subsidised travel for children travelling to school but for certain mileages there is not we know from driving anywhere how much heavier the traffic is during the school term compared with the holidays\u2014there is a tremendous difference if there are few buses as in my constituency transport becomes a problem with regard to getting to school and the congestion caused around schools from people travelling in cars new clause 9 is particularly relevant to my area and would address such problems  i will draw on an example concerning the national lottery which i assure you miss widdecombe is relevant but i must crave your indulgence for a moment earlier i referred to a large village in my constituency\u2014churchdown\u2014which has about 12000 inhabitants they applied for a lottery grant to build swimming baths in the village the reply from the national lotteries board turned down the application one of the main reasons for that was the fact that the village is within a 20minute drive of similar facilities the then minister for sport the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey said that that reply was absolute rubbish\u2014she understood its implications it meant that if children wanted to go to the nearest swimming baths their parents would have to take them and come back then collect them and come back\u2014four car journeys would be necessary because children under 17 are not allowed to drive the alternative would be not to go swimming or to pay full fares on the bus i was stunned by the reason for the rejection however it is an illustration of how new clause 9 would help children in that area it is a village of 12000 so this is not a small problem ", " i am delighted to extend an invitation to the undersecretary to visit so that we can show her our constituencies\u2014not only to illustrate the lack of bus services but to dispel the myth that we are a prosperous area my hon friend the member for cotswold travels down here every week so he knows that although the train services from cheltenham and gloucester to london might be expected to be very good they are not", " may i start by welcoming you to the committee miss widdecombe it is always a pleasure to work with you i want to touch on one or two of my earlier arguments that the minister did not fully address when he wound up the debates on the amendments i should also like to pick up some points that have already been made  this morning i said that the bill addresses a real concern because transport is important in my constituency which is not as large as that of my hon friend the member for cotswold mr cliftonbrown but is nevertheless very big and contains several towns and many villages transport is a problem we have bus services but they are inadequate whether children are travelling to school or pensioners and older people are travelling to do their shopping or go to hospital the situation is unsatisfactory the bill goes some way towards addressing that problem but as my hon friend said there are still gaps that we should like further to explore  two particular areas concern me the point about the cost to the local authority has been pressed with great determination by my hon friend but he has not got the answers that opposition members were seeking we are all in constant touch with our local authorities it is not only the tewkesbury local authority that says it is being given more to do without being compensated and it is not only tewkesbury that is complaining about the support that it gets from the government when it sees another scheme being proposed it is naturally concerned about the financial impact we have heard that there will be general compensation\u2014that was not quite the word that the minister used and if he would like to remind me of exactly what he said i should be grateful ", " yes local authorities broadly will be covered tewkesbury local authority could argue that local authorities broadly get increases in the revenue support grant which tewkesbury has not received the broad concept is unsatisfactory my hon friend the member for cotswold has also pressed the question why we do not compensate local authorities for the exact costs that they have incurred which seems sensible i accept the ministers point that that does not always happen in every aspect of local government but there are aspects in which it does several transport schemes are promoted and managed by the county council and the government give it grants to promote those schemes however the borough council will be responsible for administering this particular scheme there is an obvious gap an agreement could be made on how much tewkesbury would receive but during the financial year tewkesburys requirements could change considerably how broad is the governments guarantee it strikes me that this could create a big problem for tewkesbury ", " my hon friend is absolutely right the county council largely determines the council tax that will be raised because it has the bigger budget however tewkesbury borough council would be blamed for the increase because it sends out the letters anything that the county council does directly impacts on what tewkesbury has to collect if the government increased the money for gloucestershire to introduce new bus routes tewkesbury would then have to administer the scheme i accept that the government might one day finance that but there is a big gap in between", " i am grateful to my hon friend for throwing more confusion and complication on what is already a difficult situation he demonstrates how difficult it is no doubt the minister will explain how tewkesbury can be satisfied that it will be fully compensated for what is on the face of it a sensible measure my other point concerns costs for places such as tewkesbury and it will certainly apply also in cotswold under current legislation the borough council can make discretionary concessions in areas where there are few buses or in very large areas there will be more concessions and the requirement on those authorities will be greater for example cheltenham and gloucester are selfcontained and people can live there without leaving them unless they want to but it is different in country areas where the concessions will have to be greater equalisation of the age will increase the cost of the extra concessions it could be said that tewkesbury does not have to give them but i know from my mailbag that there is a great requirement on tewkesbury to give them the extra cost arises not only from the mandatory concessions but from the additional concessions which the government will not finance i want them to be clear about the knockon effect for tewkesbury  we have heard about crossing borders and that it important in my constituency it is ridiculous that some villagers with worcestershire postcodes will be unable to travel to worcestershire because they live not in worcestershire but in gloucestershire although they have worcestershire postcodes they will be unable to travel to evesham for example people who live in places outside gloucestershire with tewkesbury postcodes will be unable to use the scheme to travel to tewkesbury what is even more worrying is that none of the 12000 people living in churchdown in my constituencyit is one of the largest villages in the country and only a few miles from gloucester and cheltenhamwill be able to travel to cheltenham hospital because they will not qualify for the concession as they will have to cross a borough border we have only one or two cottage hospitals in my constituency so if they need even semimajor treatment the bill will not cover them when they go to those hospitals it is difficult to design a scheme to suit everyone but the government must deal with the problems that i have outlined ", " i think that the net result of that exchange is that i must move on to a different point\u2014but that i may be allowed to return to my original subject later we are talking about publishing a breakdown of the cost of travel concession schemes how certain will the cost be many areas have twotier local government and bus transport schemes seem to be administered by the county council however the district council or borough council will run the scheme under discussion to a large extent the provision of transport will be determined by the county council possibly influenced by government grants given as an encouragement what impact will that have on the scheme which will be run by the district council it may be a matter of logistics or of finance coming through in one year rather than another however it is an important point and i would be grateful if the minister picked up on it  amendment no 7 refers to the revenue support grant one aspect of which always puzzles me can we be sure that local authorities which will have extra requirements will receive the total sum due to them through the revenue support grant system is there any possibility that the extra sum is given with one hand while the other chips away elsewhere to withdraw money from another area if an authority was given say a baseline figure of 100 and something cost five would it receive 105 under the revenue support grant or 104 because one had been taken away from something else  it is important that we consider that issue as local councillors always tell me that extra work and burdens are placed on them yet the resources do not come their way that has especially been the case in tewkesbury which has not received very generous revenue support grants during the past few years forcing the council to decide whether to continue to provide services and to put up council tax it is in that dilemma now as it has to decide whether to put the council tax up after it has cut back on services that brings us back to the issue about the further concessions that councils would like to offer but are not necessarily in a financial position to offer  given the restrictions that you rightly placed on me mr stevenson i do not want to make any further remarks ", " transport is important especially these days i acknowledge the great carowning democracy but many people do not own cars and cannot get about as they wish whether transport is for leisure purposes to do vital shopping or to visit hospitals it is important to do what we can particularly in the sort of areas represented by my hon friend the member for cotswold and myself our constituencies include a few towns and villages with big spaces in between i welcome the bill and hope that it will help my constituents i have received many letters on this issue not only because of the difficulty of getting from one place to another but because of the unfairness of the present situation at the moment local authorities have to offer concessionary bus tokens they can offer further concessions at their discretion but it can be controversial if they do not the national cost for the change of age qualification will be about \u00a350 million presumably administering the changeover will incur an extra cost that cost may not be significant but will local authorities be able to cover it on the extra concessions that local authorities can provide as i said to my hon friend the member for cotswold authorities are under greater pressure to grant concessions where the bus service is inadequate i presume that if they do so they will not be compensated counties such as gloucestershire experience great unfairness for example cheltenham borough is not under pressure to give further concessions because it is a small area and it is easier to get about someone living there who needed to get to hospital in cheltenham would easily be able to do so but it would be more difficult for someone living in tewkesbury tewkesbury borough council or cotswold district council will therefore be under pressure to give further concessions ", " my hon friend demonstrates that extra pressure will be placed on some areas and not others he touched earlier on a further problem i said that someone living in cheltenham who wanted to go to hospital in cheltenham could get there easily and without the extra concessions they would be able to do so under the ordinary bus permit scheme however those who live in tewkesbury would probably need an extra concession but that will not be available as my hon friend pointed out the journey would cross borough borders and would therefore not qualify", " i certainly will mr stevenson i am grateful for your guidance i move to a slightly different point which i hope is relevant", " my hon friend refers to extra costs does he agree that to some extent the situation in his constituency and mine will be open ended because of the extra concessions that local authorities will be allowed to provide which will be discretionary if they do not provide those extra concessions in our areas\u2014they cannot provide help when there are no bus services\u2014will not the cost be open ended and does that not reinforce the need for the amendment", " i welcome you to the committee mr stevenson and look forward to working with you it remains to be seen whether that will be for a long time like my hon friend the member for cotswold i welcome our fairly openended timetable\u2014if that is not a contradiction in terms we must discuss important issues including the introduction of the equal ages qualification in the bill the proposal is eminently sensible on the face of it but i wonder what impact it will have on other aspects of life perhaps the subject is a little too wide to get into at this or indeed any stage of the bill but we should bear it in mind  another issue is the bills impact on local authorities which is more important and more relevant my hon friend the member for cotswold touched on the difficulties that our areas experience when trying to provide transport in the first place i receive many letters from constituents on the issue although i do not know whether other hon members do mr cliftonbrown indicated assent", " my hon friend indicates that he does too perhaps that is because we represent large areas it is difficult to travel from one area to another in my constituency as tewkesbury covers only one tenth of it it is important that we allow enough time to consider such problems to determine whether the proposals are relevant to the people of tewkesbury we must also discuss what impact the measures will have on local authorities authorities such as that in tewkesbury are hard pressed and we must ask whether the proposals will place another financial burden on them if that is the case we shall need to hear what will be done about that we shall also need to consider how the other concessions that local authorities are allowed to provide will be dealt with  question put and agreed to  resolved  that during proceedings on the travel concessions eligibility bill lords the committee do meet on tuesday 20th november at halfpast ten oclock and five oclock and thereafter on thursdays at five minutes to ten oclock and halfpast two oclock and on tuesdays at halfpast ten oclock and halfpast four oclock", "to ask the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs what provision he has made to increase intelligence on security matters since 11 september", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement about the future of livestock farming in the uk", "it is a pleasure to take part in the debate as someone whose day job is in the opposition whips office i do not know whether i should say this but the house is at its best when there is if not full crossparty agreement agreement on so many issues we certainly agree on what we want from public bodies how they should be run how accountable they should be and how people should be appointed to themi do not intend to summarise the debate that is a task for my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale mr collins when he returns to the chamber we have heard excellent contributions not only from frontbench members but from everyone who has spoken including the hon members for ashton\u2013under\u2013lyne mr heyes for winchester mr oaten for glasgow cathcart mr harris and for slough fiona mactaggart and my hon friend the member for isle of wight mr turneri congratulate the hon member for ashton\u2013under\u2013lyne on his election and his maiden speech i well remember when i made my maiden speech and although i spoke on a wednesday afternoon when one might have expected more members to be present than are here today that was not the case i look forward to hearing from him an awful lot morei do not think that i have to declare an interest for receiving hospitality from a public body the horserace totalisator board but i mention it because i shall return to that organisation laterthe minister made an excellent presentation explaining what public bodies are and the categories into which they fall but i was surprised to hear exactly how much money is spent on them\u2014\u00a324 billion or perhaps \u00a318 billion is a more relevant figure as that is what comes from the public purse when such huge sums are spent we must ask whether it is worth while and whether the public get from those public bodies the service that they have a right to expectwhat else could that money buy would it be better spent on more direct public services such as the health service should it be left in taxpayers pockets governments should always ask that question when taking money from the taxpayer do public bodies provide the quality of service that people need do they provide the constitutional administration on which the country dependsthe answer to those questions depends on which public body is concerned the house was again at its best when it was discussing stem cell research and the human fertilisation and embryology authority is an extremely important public body indeed it is probably one of the most important in existence given the issues that it regulates before i entered the house i dealt with homeless people and the housing corporation is an important public body that provides money to tackle homelessness thus some public bodies are very importantmy hon friend the member for isle of wight spoke about grantmaintained schools he played down his role in creating the system of grantmaintained schools which has been a huge success i pay tribute to his work if grantmaintained schools can be described as public bodies they are another example of bodies that can affect the communities in which they operate and the lives of so many peoplei wonder however whether the apple and pear research council is important it may well be and i stand corrected if it is some public bodies sound serious but i wonder whether they do the work that we want them to do i know from my time on the select committee on social security that the benefits tribunal caused us great concern indeed it was the subject of an inquiry at that timewhat about the national lottery charities board i have always defended the national lottery but there have been problems in its operation organisations in tewkesbury have made about 15 per cent of the applications made from gloucestershire a proportion appropriate to its population yet until recently tewkesbury had received only 3 per cent of the money that has come to the countyi looked at a number of those applications and they were of good quality and very sensible but they did not attract money what can i as a member of parliament do about that i went to see the then minister the hon member for vauxhall kate hoey who was extremely helpful but she could do nothing either it was obvious that my constituents were being treated unfairly that is an example of a public body operating unfairly i admit that it had its criteria but i suggest that it was not operating fairly in the interests of everybody across the countryalthough there are some good and important public bodies such as the human fertilisation and embryology authority which has perhaps a frightening amount of power given the scale of its task other public bodies are less important indeed some public bodies should not exist at alli have already mentioned the tote which has been a public body since 1927 three years ago the then home secretary announced that the tote was to be released from government control yet nothing has happened i began by declaring an interest in the tote but i do not speak in its favour i simply say that the government have a clear opportunity to lose that quango linked to it is the horserace betting levy board which distributes money through the horseracing industry it is another body that could be returned to the private sectorthe government have no need to be involved in either of those public bodies they have recognised that yet those of us who take an interest in the industry cannot get the government to do something about it despite the fact that little parliamentary time would be requiredi mentioned that i could not make any progress with lottery applications for tewkesbury and did not seem to make an impression on the national lottery charities board or sport england in spite of having had long boring meetings with them there was no way forward that leads me to accountabilitymany public bodies have a lot of power and responsibility but are not accountable to anyone i suppose that they are ultimately accountable to parliament and to ministers but what happens if things go wrong and they do not carry out their administrative role as we would expect there can be recourse to the ombudsman but he will investigate only if there is a clear case of maladministration and there can be direct redress for the person who has lost out there may be serious maladministration but it may not be possible to provide redress to an individual or a group of individuals so there is a gap in the systemit is important that public bodies are accountable there is a growing lack of faith in politics parliament public servants public bodies and the democratic process itself the hon member for winchester made a thoughtful interesting speech and gave some figures it worries me that the turnout at the general election was less than 60 per centi used to tell people to look at what happens in america\u2014a country that i greatly admire\u2014where only 50 per cent of the electorate vote and only 50 per cent of that 50 per cent vote for the elected president that is terrible and i ask them to consider what happens in this country where 78 per cent turn out to vote which is marvellous\u2014or which was marvellous because all of a sudden something went wrong at the last election people may argue that there was not enough obvious difference between the two parties\u2014interruption\u2014between the three parties i beg the hon gentlemans pardon that perception is real and in politics perception is all important because people vote not according to reality but according to their perceptions when it comes to the ballot box if people feel that something is the case then it is the casei am not sure what the average turnout is for local and european elections but it is very low why is that", "as usual my hon friend makes a good intellectual point there are many reasons for the low turnout and i shall explore some of them one reason why people do not vote in local and european elections is that they do not think voting matters i have never been a fan of the european union and even less of the european parliament so i can well understand people who think that voting in those elections will not make a difference having sat on the select committee on european scrutiny for two years i sympathise with that view endless directives come through the house literally every day and people are powerless to stop them i can well understand people not wanting to vote in european elections there is a strong constitutional argument for thathowever it is worth voting in local elections my wife was a county councillor for four years and i often said to her that she had far more power and influence than i have that is true proud though i am to be a member of the house that role is somewhat different what happens in local government is important but people are not persuaded of that and will not vote in local government elections they cannot understand why planning applications that no one wants are accepted either locally or at inspector level they see a huge democratic deficit we must deal with that the creation of public bodies just for the sake of it does not deal with that problem but adds to iti have a constituency example that illustrates fully what i mean it was the subject of my adjournment debate last week so i crave your indulgence mr deputy speaker for repeating it just over a year ago a chemical reprocessing plant in my constituency was for reasons best known to the county council at the time built on a flood plain planning permission was given in 1978 it was a very dangerous plant that gave off lots of bad odours heavy lorries went into it at all times of night and day it was a bad neighbour with scant regard for the environment or amenities no one wanted to live near itfor years people not only complained about that site but gave warnings about it to a number of agencies and public bodies the environment agency the health and safety executive and the county council there was a lack of response from those bodiesjust over 12 months ago there was a very serious explosion at the site fortunately it happened at night so no one was there two days later the river severn flooded the entire site the fire and rescue service said that if the explosion and the flood had coincided it could not have accessed the site to tackle the fire one can imagine the dangers inherent in that statement people had to be evacuated people from nearby villages were ill people had to go into hospital they are still complaining about feeling ill 12 months onthe agencies and public bodies were warned that that was going to happen yet took no action they could have closed the site the environment agency the county council and indeed the minister have powers under various legislation to close it they have chosen not to do so not because they do not recognise that it is dangerous\u2014it is we all recognise that\u2014but because they are frightened of being taken to court by the company that is an exercise not in democracy but in bullying and fear people in sandhurst gloucestershire have to live under the threat of that site reopening\u2014it is on the brink of being reopened\u2014and further dangers arisingfurthermore the environment agency which was supposed to have been monitoring the site is being allowed to produce reports on what happened on the site and on its monitoring of it the agency has a distinct disincentive to investigate the site fully because the more it finds out about what happened the worse it looks as the waste licensing authorityi have pressed for the public inquiry that must be held into not only the explosion and the company but the performance of the agencies in monitoring the site the health and safety executive was well aware that an employee was sacked by the company for failing to carry out what he considered to be dangerous duties he took his case to the industrial tribunal and won yet the health and safety executive fully aware of that took no further actionthe county council gave planning permission for the site in 1978 to treat oily wastes and waste oils yet very dangerous chemicals were treated on the site including carcinogenic chemicals and bse drums which were ordered by the government from an agricultural area\u2014the government said send them to cleansing services group in sandhurst the company did not have planning permission for any of thatthe county council had discovered that huge breach of planning laws two years before the explosion however\u2014i have this in writing from the council\u2014it did nothing to correct the position the environment agency nevertheless issued operating licences to the company which was so stupid as to be unbelievable earlier someone\u2014possibly the hon member for glasgow cathcart\u2014mentioned agencies not speaking to each other and not tying in their activities that certainly applied in this instancei hope that the house will forgive me for taking so long to make a constituency point but it shows why people are losing faith in public servants whether elected or appointedi do not want to be party political but i suppose that i am going to be when i talk about local councils i regret the creation of cabinet or executivestyle councils thanks to the good sense of the gloucestershire electorate the conservatives form the largest group on the county council but are excluded from the executive because in a postelection pact\u2014not a preelection pact of course\u2014labour and the liberal democrats got together to exclude them that is not illegal but it is not terribly democratic and it certainly does not serve the best interests of the electorate it could happen only because the government had changed local government rules and i think it regrettablemany backbench councillors across the country have received increases in their allowances but along with those large decreases in responsibility they now consider council membership worthless i mentioned that my wife was a county councillor one of the reasons for her failure to stand in the most recent elections was the fact that she had to make a decision either she would join the executive and work almost as a fulltime councillor which is what is now required\u2014in fact she could not have for the reasons i gave but the facts were not known then\u2014or she would become a back bencher and not be involved at allmy wife did not want to be a fulltime councillor for two reasons first she did not have time to commit herself to that secondly that is not what council work is supposed to be about council work is supposed to be about living in the community whether as a housewife or an executive and bringing that experience to the council a couple of nights a week that is how things used to be when local government operated far better than it does nowwe seem to have created a twotier system in local councils rather like that in the house of commons in which the executive\u2014or perhaps one two or three members of the executive\u2014are allpowerful while the rest are almost impotent unless they are determined to do something different moreover the executiveandbackbench style will not encourage people to stand for council membership it is all very well for mps to say they want to encourage better candidates but as my hon friend the member for isle of wight said we must show that these organisations are doing a good job and that it is worthwhile joining them that would be far more likely to attract candidates of the kind that we want\u2014women members of ethnic minorities and people with disabilities for instance\u2014than a search for candidates from different backgrounds in that respect i depart slightly from the otherwise excellent speech of the hon member for sloughwhat kind of people can we hope to attract to serve on councils when we create a setup where it is all or nothing and one is either a back bencher with no influence or a member of the executive and required almost fulltime we can attract either people who rather like the idea of the word councillor before their name even though it does not entail much or those who have an interest in dragging out meetings all day because they have nothing else to do when we do not want to attract either the government have made it almost impossible to attract the sort of people we want which is regrettablei have never served in local government i do not have a vested interest in it however from experience in gloucestershire and tewkesbury i can see what has happened it bothers me that we shall miss out on many good people serving not only on councils but on other public bodies i shall not go into the matter of appointments to public bodies suffice it to say that we are not reaching out to the sort of people to whom we need to reach outi mentioned that i had a slight difference of opinion with the hon member for slough on such appointments although she pointed out that all the governments efforts and determination to be politically correct have failed to change things for the better she said that more women people with disabilities and people from ethnic communities had not been attracted to undertake such roles if that is so we must ask why", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for intervening if that is so i fully accept it i recognise that the hon lady made a good speech and i agreed with virtually all of itas my hon friend the member for isle of wight said we should make public bodies appear relevant to ordinary people that would attract them to serve people always follow success and do not normally jump on a sinking ship they see success and are led by it they will be led by the relevance of public bodies and whether they are worth while we should seek out not somebody from one group or another\u2014it is demeaning to those groups to do so\u2014but the right people who will of course include women people from ethnic backgrounds and those with disabilitiesi say that as somebody who argued strongly in favour of women priests during the debate in the general synod some years ago\u20141992 i think although i might be considered to be from a more traditional background i did so because i thought it right that people should be allowed to do whatever job they want regardless of their sex marital status background or whatever however i do not believe that it is advantageous to go down the route of positive discrimination i was therefore concerned this week\u2014i am stretching beyond my pay grade by suggesting this\u2014about the sex discrimination election candidates bill it is inconsistent with other legislation because it legalises discrimination it suggests that it is all right for politicians to discriminate but that nobody else in society can do so the bill is very curious but as my party did not oppose it and given my day job as a whip i better move on swiftlyi agree with what my hon friend the member for isle of wight said about the house of lords there has been a transfer of power from the house of commons to the executive and to other anonymous bodies that most people have not heard of although this may contradict what i have said already i would not welcome changes in the makeup of the house of lords i shall make some brief comments now because my party has not yet determined its policy and i would like to make this point before it is too latei can live with the undemocratic nature of the house of lords as long as it has no power that relates to what i said about quangos although some hon members may find it contradictory the fact that the house of lords is not democratic adds to its quality as its members can say what they feel is right and unless they are ministers nobody can sack them or reduce their pay that is a useful addition to parliamenti would always defend parliamentary democracy and the power of the house of commons because it is democratically elected and that is why i am concerned by the governments proposals for the house of lords other people have gone much further and proposed an elected element i would not want the house of commons to be replicated as it would be a waste of resources and because it would pose a challenge to the house of commons that would weaken rather than strengthen parliamentary democracy it could also result in gridlock as has happened in the united states the system of government there produces a presidential election turnout of about 50 per cent so it has not done them much goodsome people would say that a government as powerful as ours with a majority of more than 170 should be challenged by a stronger chamber that could produce gridlock i understand that point but the most damaging and irreversible measures put through by the present government have been constitutional ones such as the changes to the house of lords devolution and the introduction of alien voting systems in european and regional elections those measures were passed by the house of lords because its members felt unable to resist them i understand those who say that gridlock might be better but i do not agreeif we take the wrong decisions in respect of the house of lords we shall lose the tremendous wisdom that exists among its members who include people who have served in the house on other public bodies and succeeded in other walks of life including business inviting such people to sit in a chamber that does not necessarily reward them for that service but allows the country to draw on their experience is an excellent system and i do not want to lose itanyone who reads the house of lords hansard as i occasionally do when i am researching an issue will be startled by the quality of debate there the upper house also provides quality legal services some hon members would describe it as the worst public body but i think that it is the bestmy hon friend the member for isle of wight said that if he were to come up with a new system for the house of lords he would not start from the same place if one were to design a brand new constitution for a country one perhaps would not have started by drawing up a system in which some peers inherit their titles and others gain theirs through appointment but we do not live in an ideal world the fact that the house of lords worked is good enough reason to keep it and the fact that many of the public bodies to which i referred do not is good enough reason to get rid of them", "to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs what plans she has to claim agrimonetary compensation from the eu and

following an explosion at the site i want to call also for a public inquiry into the incident at the site and into the performance of the relevant agencies in monitoring the sites activitiesfirst i should like to thank the minister for the environment who has been very helpful and has met me several times to discuss the matter he cannot be present tonight unavoidably but i thank the under\u2013secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs who will respond to the debate and who i know is up to speed with the issuecleansing services group is a chemical treatment plant incredibly it was built on a floodplain in sandhurst gloucestershire in my constituency the company has been a very bad neighbour it has shown a disregard for the environment and local residents and for the areas amenities for many years bad odours have escaped from the site and heavy lorries have troubled neighboursmany complaints have been made to the environment agency the health and safety executive and the county council about the sites activities over the years the fact that those complaints have been largely ignored has given rise to this debate i shall describe the incident that took place and its seriousness in a few minutes if the agencies had listened to the complaints and acted accordingly it is possible that the incident would not have happenedi visited the site twice on the first visit i was denied a tour and was shown only certain areas on my second visit i was not shown the dangerous area but i came away with stinging eyes and a tight chest i reported that to the agencies concernedan employee at the csg site kevin harris was sacked for refusing to carry out certain dangerous duties he took his case to an industrial tribunal and won again the relevant agencies were aware of thissimilar complaints were made over many years just over a year ago on 30 october 2000 a major explosion took place at the site that surprised no one but it affected a great many people two people had to be detained in hospital and there were many ongoing health problems people in neighbouring villages were affected large parts of sandhurst village were evacuated and people had to stay in hotels for many daysif that was not bad enough the entire site flooded\u2014i noted earlier that it was situated on a floodplain\u2014and a major cleanup operation ensued worryingly gloucestershire fire and rescue service said that it would have been unable to tackle the fire if flood and fire had coincidedfurthermore the acting chief officer of gloucestershires fire and rescue service wrote to the chief executive of the environment agency on 9 november 2000 he stated thatshould a further incident occur at the site gfrs will need to take a decision whether in the circumstances to expose fire fighters to extraordinary risks no assurance can therefore be given that gfrs will commit its fire fighters to dealing with an incident at the site if the current hazardous situation is not cured by the environment agency under its powersthere can be no doubt that the responsibility for the explosion lies with the company that site is a terrible place to work or even to visit the company has shown scant regard for the community and certain staff at the site have shown great arrogance one manager told me that he did not even know that the site was on a floodplain\u2014an incredible statement the company should be investigated especially with regard to the operation of that site and the site should be closed down by the environment agency or by the minister that is the first point that i want to make in this adjournment debate", "i certainly agree and if the hon gentleman will bear with me i shall make a main point about that in a momentthe second point that i want to make is that the agencies\u2014the environment agency the hse and the county council all of which are paid by the taxpayer to protect us\u2014are supposed to monitor the site but they have singularly failed to do so despite having received very many warnings about itthe main purpose of this adjournment debate is to call for a public inquiry into the incident and into the performance of the agencies monitoring of the site beforehand and indeed afterwards i have met the deputy prime minister and the minister for the environment a number of times and i have even raised the issue with the prime minister but as yet no decision has been made on a public inquiry even though a year has passed i should like to consider the performance of the agencies to explain why such an inquiry is necessarythe environment agency was warned over many years by many people\u2014residents councillors and myself\u2014that the site was dangerous but it took inadequate notice and inadequate action seemingly making excuses for the company since the explosion the environment agency seems interested only in avoiding a court case it did issue a suspension notice but it has recently replaced it with a more lenient oneagain to quote the acting chief officer of the gloucestershire fire and rescue service the environment agency was pedestriandelayed providing info to gold controlwhich tried to control the incidentwere looking to protect their cornererred on the side of their own safetydemonstrated a great naivety and hada primary concern that they will lose a case in the courtsthose are quite damning wordsthe environment agency was warned many times of the dangers of the site but amazingly it now seems to be allowed to investigate itself it is also being allowed to investigate the site it therefore has a disincentive to discover the full extent of problems because it was responsible for monitoring the site that totally disserves the public and taxpayers the environment agency should be subjected to a full independent public inquiryin 1978 the county council granted planning permission for the treatment of waste oils and oily wastes\u2014 a change of use which relates to the point made by the hon member for newbury mr rendel the council now admits thatwithout planning permission unauthorised change of use for the site from a plant for the treatment of waste oils and oily wastes to an integrated waste chemical transport plant has occurredinstead of waste oils and oily wastes cleansing services group has stored bsecontaminated material highly flammable chemicals corrosive chemicals irritants oxidising chemicals explosive chemicals toxic chemicals chemicals that release toxic gases and carcinogenic chemicals yet no one noticed or did anyonethe county council became aware of the problem in 1998\u2014two years before the explosion took place\u2014yet no action was taken when did the environment agency know how was it able to continue to issue operating licences when the company was in such serious breach of its planning permission did not the environment agency and the county council ever talk to each other i understand that the county council is now to be investigated by the local government ombudsman but it too should be subject to the rigours of a public inquirythe hse was aware of the incident involving the sacked employee but it was described by the gloucestershire fire and rescue service as being less than helpful and amazingly the service said thatthey engaged in dubious health and safety practicesi am afraid that the health authority has also not covered itself in glory in most peoples eyes following the incidentthe environment agency and the hse have been commissioned to produce reports but so what people will not and cannot be satisfied if agencies are allowed to investigate themselves\u2014it is a joke a full independent public inquiry is the only way to investigate fully the incident and the performance of the agenciesit could be that the agencies need more powers or it could be that they did not exercise their powers properly if there is not a full inquiry the question remains are these quangos any use at all if they perform like this either way the residents of my constituency have a right to know the truth and have a right to expect the agencies to do the jobs that they are paid to dointernal investigations cannot be the sole method of inquiry indeed i understand that the government are rightly considering how to make the investigations of complaints against the police more independent i applaud that strategy but i ask the minister to apply the same philosophy in this case otherwise peoples faith\u2014or lack of faith\u2014in the democratic process will be further frustrated and their concern about government by quango will be fuelledpeople see nothing as being anyones fault any more no one wants to take responsibility for anything on a wider point i suggest that that is one of the reasons for voter apathy which is dangerousi have raised a big issue that affected my area greatly i presented a petition to parliament with 2100 signatures calling for the site to be closed the effectiveness of the agencies is a wider matterto summarise the site should be closed and a full independent public inquiry should be announced at the time of the incident all six gloucestershire mps representing three political parties called for such an inquiry two of them are here tonight hon members three three of them are here so all three political parties are presented i assume that they have not changed their minds about calling for a public inquiry i ask the minister to announce that action tonight", "to ask the secretary of state for defence what plans

appeal to finance the creation of a hostel for homeless women in london although i do not think that i need to declare that as an interest it has certainly given me some experience of the subject and a general interest in it i was very grateful then for the help of my hon friend the member for wealden mr hendry who at that time represented high peak in his speech he displayed a great deal of knowledge about homelessness and showed how complicated the subject ismy hon friend spoke about the rough sleepers initiative as it was in those days which i believe was set up in 1993 or 1994 the rsi was useful and provided a great deal of money for the project on which i was working however i agree with my frontbench colleagues that the time has come to consider whether the money spent on the rough sleepers unit could be better used i want to touch on issues that have been mentioned already without detaining the house too longmy hon friend the member for cotswold mr cliftonbrown talked about two issues that particularly interest me the first is the need to understand why people become homeless or more particularly why they might sleep on the streets and the second is duplication we have considered those matters in some detail but they deserve further scrutinythe hon member for hampstead and highgate glenda jackson spoke about the reasons for homelessness and correctly pointed out that the solution is not simply a matter of finding someone a house in fact that can add to the problem we are familiar with the reasons for homelessness two of the most significant are family breakdown and violence in the home my hon friend the member for wealden pointed out that young people may become homeless because they are not treated properly at home or in a local authority home that is a tremendous problem and homeless young people often lie about their age to get into hostels because some hostels will not take people below a certain ageas well as everybody in the house understanding why people become homeless it is essential that homeless people understand the reasons for their situation and what they have to do to change it however people have to work with them to get them to that point when i was working with the homeless years ago i heard some very stupid politicians on the television saying that people on the streets if asked would say that they did not want to go into a hostel or a home and preferred to be on the streets that is wrong and it misses the pointof course people who have escaped from a terrible family background from violence or sexual abuse will find it a relief no longer to be in that situation it frightens them to think about getting another home where they will be faced with bills and huge responsibilities and where they might end up in a situation as bad as the one from which they escaped however that does not mean that they prefer to sleep on the streets it means that the challenges that they face are too much for them and that can be misinterpreted as a desire to remain on the streets those people need helpto provide that help fully to resettle people and to continue to work with them once they have been resettled takes a great deal of money and expertise when i was working with the homeless both those things were missing we needed more resources to try to get people into hostels and then to get them into their own home above all we needed more understanding of the problem and the expertise to deal with it i want more resources to be devoted to finding people with that expertise who can help people move from the streets into temporary accommodation and then into their own place even then they will still need help if the resettlement is to be a success and they are not to become homeless againi endorse the point about duplication made by my hon friend the member for cotswold when i was working with the homeless there was duplication but there were also gaps in provision there was duplication in that there were many agencies involved in homelessness including the housing corporation local authorities housing associations the rsi and charities although they overlapped however huge gaps were evident in an understanding of the issue and in the will to help the homeless if the bill can fill in those gaps and avoid duplication we will have achieved a great deali worked in london for three years before i was elected in 1997 and when i went to tewkesbury people gently reminded me that there was homelessness in gloucestershire it then struck me that the rsu and the earlier initiative had created a twotier system i readily acknowledge that the initiative was quite successful in london but in other areas of the country it was not in place or it was not successful and it fell to the local authorities to do something about homelessnessthat brings me back to the central point made by my hon friend which is that there must be a better way of making progress than by continuing with the present situationi shall not speak to new clauses 2 and 3 as they have already been dealt with competently and eloquently by my hon friends they are not saying that people with the problems that have been described should not be helped or housed but that there are many people who have not been caught up in problems with alcohol crime and drugs and whose families are intact and that those people also have rights i think that my hon friends were making those points when speaking to new clauses 2 and 3", "there is indeed a great deal of duplication will my hon friend speculate on how

organisations remain in government the ruc is being dismantled and terrorists are allowed on to the streets is not the reason for all that the fact that the agreement was slightly flawed in the first

traditions in the assembly is it not time to start again in doing so should we not be determined to place the blame for the situation where it really lies\u2014not with the unionists but with the terrorists in northern ireland", "i cannot follow that so i shall speak in the normal way if that is acceptable\nlike my hon friend the member for north thanet mr gale i feel a little uneasy about the bill as i have said previously my unease is based partly on one or two words in the measure\u2014and indeed on some matters that are not included\u2014and partly on the bills tone the assumptions in it are worrying\nthe bill depends heavily on statementing this morning i received a letter from the worried parent of a child with special needs that said that statementing was all very well but that its effectiveness depended on the amount of detail in specifying the requirements of each child of course that is extremely it important it would be very easy for statements to be prepared for children that would give them the opportunity to go to special schools however if those statements were not properly prepared the child would end up at the wrong school that is an aspect of the bill about which i am very concerned\nthe tone of the bill and the motivation for it also worry me having sat through the second reading debate and been privileged to serve on the standing committee i have been concerned about a number of its aspects there has almost been an assumption that all children are clamouring and absolutely desperate to be included in mainstream schools there is no doubt that some are many children are already included in mainstream schools and there is no doubt that there have been some in the past who should have gone to mainstream schools but did not\nthere is however another side to that argument an awful lot of children are desperately frightened of being sent to mainstream schools and they will not be particularly reassured by the bill we have heard many\n\nsad examples particularly in committee of children being excluded from mainstream schools and suffering as a result we also heard of children with special needs going to mainstream schools and benefiting from it hon members have given very real examples but there are also examples illustrating the other side of the argument in which children have been sent to mainstream schools that have palpably failed them i was surprised but pleased to hear the secretary of state give an example of a child who was sent to a mainstream school but at that point in his education it was not right for him\nwe can all quote examples such as that but they are not all onesided many people who have been to see me and other hon members are desperately frightened of being sent to a mainstream school because they and their parents know that they need to go to a special school\non second reading i rather unkindly but probably accurately described parts of the bill as a triumph of theory over reality i regret having had to say that and i would not have said it had not my experiences in gloucestershire taught me that it is the case it is no use ministers saying that the bill and previous statements on it are not a green light for the wholesale closure of special schools because that is what is happening in gloucestershire there is a systematic closure of special schools interruption labour members are speaking from sedentary positions if they want to come to gloucestershire to see what is going on i would be delighted to pick them up at the station and take them to the schools to show them the feeling there", "i said that that was happening in gloucestershire i cannot speak for what is happening in lancashire or yorkshire as it is the liberal democrat and labour alliance in gloucestershire that is closing the schools it is up to that alliance to explain why it is drawing the inference from the governments actions that it is drawing it is not for me as a conservative member to try to interpret the bill or the reasons why the alliance is closing special schools in gloucestershire bownham park school in stroud is under threat of closure the notice has been served i cannot explain why that is so but that is the reality ministers have to accept that reality\nwe have discussed whether resources will follow children and whether sufficient resources will be put in my hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may made those important points i have a further fear also based on my experience in gloucestershire rather than the resources following the pupils to the mainstream schools quite the reverse can happen some local authorities are trying to close special schools to save money far from the resources following the children the special schools are under threat of closure in gloucestershire to save money\nto prove my point the former director of education in gloucestershire let slip a comment at a meeting that he had forgotten for a moment that i was attending when challenged about saving money on the education budget he said that through the sen programme he was doing his damnedest i rest my case", "my hon friend mentioned the need to travel long distances to special schools will he speculate why parents and children might be prepared to travel those distances could it be the special treatment and care that children get at those schools parents and children often have to travel at their own expense but they consider it to be well worth it", "i agree with my hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may about the needs of the child being paramount it is rather surprising that we have had to table this new clause one would assume that as the government have said how important it is to introduce the bill to help children with special educational needs and disabilities such a provision would not be missing from it the children about whom we are talking are the very children whom the bill is supposedly designed to help\ni know that there is probably general support for the bills principles but i have a little difficulty with it because of experiences that i have had in my constituency i do not want to take up too much of the houses time in going over the ground that i covered on second reading and in committee but i have some concerns about what is happening in special educational needs at the moment\ni accept that many children with sen can be included in mainstream schools many already are including children in my constituency in gloucestershire however the labour party and indeed the liberal democrats on the county council seem determined to challenge the need for so many special schools and even to embark on a programme to close such schools as i have said in the house before a school in stroud bownham park\u2014it is not actually in my constituency\u2014is scheduled for closure we are challenging the decision because it is felt that if that school is closed a number of other schools in gloucestershire will also be closed which would reduce the amount of sen provision in the county\nalthough it is possible to provide special education in mainstream schools it is important for a number of special schools to be available for children to attend if that is their wish and the wish of their parents i have already accepted that many children can go to mainstream schools even if they have special needs and that many do but if children or their parents decide that education in special schools is really necessary the facility should be provided\nwhat is surely of overriding importance\u2014what must matter more than any fine theories that we may propound here and more than any political dogma or political\n\n\ncorrectness\u2014is that each child should be assessed on the basis of what he or she needs and that the child is offered education that will suit those individual requirements\nmany children at special schools are currently feeling rather challenged they sense that their schools are under threat and fear that their voices are not being listened to there is a great movement towards inclusion which is justified in many instances but many children are frightened by the bill they are frightened by the prospect of their schools being closed as a result of political correctness or party dogma and they want people to listen to them\nlast month i welcomed a delegation from alderman knight school in my constituency to the house of commons one girl who knew that she had special educational needs spoke to the meeting very bravely she came out with a phrase that i will never forget for as long as i am elected to this place she said that no one was listening to her\nsurely politicians in all parties have a duty to listen to what is said by those whom we are supposed to be trying to help i support the new clause because i fear that we are not listening to expressions of concern from individual pupils with special educational needs", "if he will list his official engagements for wednesday 25 april", "i have given notice of this question\nthe prime minister will be aware of the explosion that took place last year at the cleansing services group a chemical works in my constituency the explosion occurred even though we had given the environment agency plenty of notice that the site was not safe given the companys total disregard for the environment and its neighbours to the extent that even the fire and rescue service cannot guarantee that it would turn up at another incident on the site does he agree that closure is the only safe option will he order a public inquiry into the environment agencys abilities to monitor such a site will he please action those things today", " does my hon friend accept that the parents who must try to find a way through the minefield are sometimes less well equipped to do so than other parents might be", " i am concerned that if special schools are not retained there will be no choice for parents as my hon friend the member for daventry pointed out section 146 of the 1996 act provides for securing special educational provision not schools there is a difference", " given the full speech that my hon friend has just made in which he covered many different areas i do not intend to detain the committee for long especially as today is the 43rd anniversary of my birth and i know that committee members will want to buy me a drink at lunchtime\u2014not all of them hopefully otherwise i shall not be able to speak this afternoon on that basis they probably all will i want to underline some of the points made by my hon friend the two important words in the amendment are balance and local as my hon friend has rightly pointed out national provision is not necessarily equally reflected locally to draw an analogy there are various guidance notes about planning but there is provision that guidance should be interpreted locally\u2014and rightly so local planning guidance varies because of local difficulties that is also true of education national policies are not always equally interpreted across the country i do not want to test your patience mr obrien or bore the committee by talking too much about gloucestershire again i have made my point about gloucestershire in committee and in the house so i shall not go into that other than to say that it is a good example of what my hon friend described if a local authority wants to unbalance provision in its area either because it is misguided or it has bad intentions parents have no choice choice in education will not be preserved if there are no schools to choose between  during our second sitting i asked the minister how we ensure special school provision in a given area to turn the question around if we accept\u2014i do not entirely go along with this interpretation\u2014that there is no desire to close special schools how do we ensure that special schools remain the minister replied that the bill neither guarantees special school provision nor makes it less likely the local education authority must ensure adequate provision for special educational needs\u2014official report standing committee b 27 march 2001 c 55 i accept that that is the governments guidance\u2014and the committees\u2014but how are we to ensure that it is put into practice the amendment and in particular new paragraph a reinforces that aim  as my hon friend said even where there are special schools it can be difficult to obtain a place especially in the current climate of scrutiny of special educational needs provision with a presumption in favour of inclusion in gloucestershire several parents pay quite a lot of money to transport their children from one end of what is quite a big county to the other simply to obtain the special education that they feel their children need  information to enable parents to assess which school they would prefer for their children is another area of difficulty which my hon friend also touched on i mentioned on second reading a young man called brian beard an 11yearold whose parents felt that they had not been given full information or any choice about where their son should attend school he went to a mainstream school where he could not cope he was temporarily taken out of school with a view to trying for a place in a special school the school understood that to be a withdrawal and has since said that it does not expect him to return the local education authority has not provided for him to attend a special school as a result since september\u2014and it is now march\u2014that young man has had no education hon members would all accept that that familys predicament is not acceptable  what has happened is due partly to the shrinking number of special school places but also to the complexity of the effort to find the right school for a pupil that needs to be simplified if i had drafted the amendment i might have made it even stronger but i hope that the amendment will contribute to simplification  my hon friend the member for guildford mr st aubyn who is not in his place at present pointed out that some local education authorities whether for reasons of resources or of philosophy do not provide adequate special education and therefore do not do their duty in that respect as i pointed out in an intervention the notes to the bill suggest that 20 per cent of pupils have special educational needs at some stage in their school careers which is a serious matter the committee should do what it can to ensure that local education authorities or indeed the national assembly for wales have a responsibility to provide a balance of schools to suit parents requirements for their children  i do not want to say more other than to emphasise at the risk of trying the committees patience that what is fine in theory is not necessarily so on the ground experience from gloucestershire drives me to continue to tell the committee and the house that in some areas\u2014gloucestershire is not the only one\u2014the situation is not as it should be ", "if he will make a statement on his departments assessment of the relationship between the real and the provisional ira 154341", "does the minister not think that the use of semtex by the real ira might suggest at least some collusion between that organisation and at least some members of the provisional ira", " the minister gave a detailed explanation of how local decisionmaking works however i want to know how the bill provides that there will be special schools in gloucestershire", " may i ask an innocent question how can the minister ensure that the council will not close all special schools in its area she has said several times that she does not have the power to prevent the closure of special schools i dispute the contention that she has no hand in that unless she appoints an adjudicator will she explain how that will work in gloucestershire where the council seems determined to close such schools", " i agree that educational requirements should be paramount does my hon friend also accept that the social requirements are not met when the child does not successfully integrate into a mainstream school in fact the reverse is true", " the hon lady makes a good point but there are no signs of a change so far although it may be different when the bill is enacted the proposal to close burnham park school in stroud is still before the adjudicator and he will make a decision one way or the other she is right in theory but this is another case of theory over reality and in reality the decision will not be reversed the decision could be reversed if the makeup of the county council in gloucestershire changed if the prime minister had the nerve to hold elections in may that is the only way in which the special schools in gloucestershire will remain open we are talking about parental choice and what is best for the child i shall put a genuine question to the minister in all innocence if there are no special schools left in gloucestershire where is parental choice does she have responsibility in this bill or existing acts to ensure that the county has special schools parents teachers pupils and even the lea would have no choice whatever if there were no special schools ", " i do not know of those figures but i am more than happy to accept them it is curious how the figures on the closure of special schools because of demand or lack of it can be manipulated\u2014not of course by the hon gentleman but by leas the bill will make that problem worse if an lea does not statement a child that child will have to go to a mainstream school that could reduce the numbers in special schools we have all seen schools closed by stealth before an lea puts it about that a school might be in danger so parents do not send their children there that means falling numbers so the lea says that the school is unsustainable ", " i am grateful to my hon friend for making that point well", " i am grateful to my hon friend for making another powerful point the issue creates a great deal of emotion my hon friend was kind enough to come to the jubilee room last week to meet parents pupils and governors of and local councillors connected to alderman knight school in my constituency the school feels that it is under great threat we shall have to wait to see what happens the first decision to be made in gloucestershire is about burnham park school but there is great fear as to what the knockon effect will be on alderman knight school", " i wish the hon lady every success in trying to save her school i do not know why it is under pressure i only know why schools are under pressure in my area where the green paper was seen as a green light for closure i accept the argument of other hon members that that should not be the case but it is the case i shall finish soon i did not want to make a long speech\u2014in fact i have made a short one but the interventions have made it long however i should like the minister to address first my point what happens if there are no special schools in an area what will happen to parental choice in gloucestershire if that is the case that is the scenario that we face  my second point is that all hon members should ask parents and particularly pupils who are involved with special schools what they think many will have done so already some will not such pupils overwhelmingly believe in the role of the special school they know that in many cases they cannot cope in mainstream schools they know that they would suffer in such schools and a number of people attached to mainstream schools know that the pupils in those schools would suffer as well we can all quote examples there should not be an overpresumption on inclusion every decision should be based on the needs of the child i should like to repeat the quote that i gave on second reading from a young girl\u2014i think that she was aged about 15 or 16\u2014who spoke at the jubilee room last week very bravely in front of 50 or 60 people she just said  noone is listening to us it is a very sad comment on the political process if a young girl feels that i ask the minister to make sure that that is not the case ", " my hon friend makes an important point he will be aware that according to the notes provided with the bill about 20 per cent of children will have some form of special educational need at some time given the number of pupils affected is it not terrible if leas lack the relevant provision", " i can assure the hon gentleman that it has certainly been in the minds of certain people in gloucestershire that closing special schools is a way of saving money the then director of education mr roger crouch said in front of labour members that he was doing his damnedest to save money through the sen programme in gloucestershire", " when i spoke on second reading i referred perhaps rather unkindly to the bill as a triumph of theory over reality that is certainly true of the first clause and i said it because i feel that there is an element of political correctness running through the bill one of my main concerns is that there seems to be a presumption in favour of inclusion hon members may say that that is desirable but we have not achieved full inclusion throughout the education system on second reading i spoke about my education which did not take long because there was not much of it i did not successfully negotiate the 11plus whereas my sister with whom i discussed the matter over dinner last night did we went to the same primary school and sixth form but we went to different schools in between she went to a grammar school and i went to a secondary modern i would not change that for one minute ", " many children with physical disabilities do not want to go to mainstream schools i accept that the opposite is also true but the purpose of my example is to emphasise that there were grammar schools and secondary modern schools and as one hon member has already said the government have done nothing to bring about the end of grammar schools they have made a halfhearted attempt to encourage the demolition of grammar schools but in this parliament they have not ended that system or the independent school system\u2014", " i take that advice mr obrien my point is that we must be careful about what inclusion means the government have done nothing to bring about greater inclusion by narrowing the types of school each with a different ethos that provide different forms of education", " i certainly would not dispute that many children in gloucestershire are included in mainstream schools i do not know how recently the hon gentleman taught in gloucestershire\u2014", " before i was there certainly many head teachers teachers governors and pupils are very nervous about the governments policy on inclusion and how it is being interpreted by gloucestershire county council some 32000 people have signed a petition in protest against the closure of special schools in the county that is about 5000 or 6000 in each constituency", " the hon lady is snapping at my ankles like a terrier i am willing to accept that some children are excluded from mainstream schools i made that clear on second reading and i thought that i had made it clear this morning however it also happens the other way round i have had school pupils come to the house\u2014my hon friends have met them\u2014begging and pleading for their special schools to be kept open because they know that they will not be able to cope at mainstream schools i hope that the hon lady will not deny thatmiss begg indicated assent", " she suggests that she would not deny it i am grateful", " my hon friend is right i am rather uncomfortable about clause 1 for the reasons given by my hon friend which is why i support the amendment i make no apology for discussing gloucestershire as a member of parliament i am paid to represent a constituency there the hon member for aberdeen south miss begg suggested that the authority was not carrying out its duties properly if that is an accurate summary of her words that was the effect of the green paper i cannot blame the bill as it has not yet been enacted it is wise to consider the effects of the green paper the closure of burnham park school stroud has already been proposed the schools organisation committee was not unanimous about that decision so the adjudicator must decide the schools future that is not theory it is the reality of what is happening in gloucestershire the minister wrote to me\u2014i thank her for the letter\u2014saying that such decisions are now being made locally however letters to the adjudicator have to be sent not to gloucestershire but to darlington i am not sure how that means that such decisions are made locally but that is slightly off the point given the county councils policy allowing that school to close would surely give a green light to closure of other special schools in gloucestershire i should explain that the county council is not controlled by the conservative party as the secretary of state once made the mistake of thinking it is controlled by an unholy alliance of labour and liberal democrat councillors ", " is there not a grey area regarding parental wishes in new section 3162 that subsection saysif no statement is maintained  he must be educated in a mainstream school does that not mean that if the lea did not maintain a statement the parents wishes could be totally overridden ", " before my hon friend leaves the point about resources does he accept that some local education authorities see the bill as a means of saving money rather than as a way to ensure that the money from special schools follows the child", "today has been quite an experience because i welcomed 50 people to the jubilee room from the alderman knight school in my constituency the school feels very much under threat because of the policies pursued by gloucestershire county council and an unholy alliance of labour and liberal democrat councillors\nthe county council has already proposed the closure of bownham park school in stroud and i have written to the secretary of state for education and employment to ask him what judgment he will make on that proposal people in gloucestershire are certainly not persuaded that the school should close and his decision will give us an indication as to his views on special schools", "yes i accept that but the school organisation committee has failed to be unanimous so it will be left to an adjudicator to make the decision therefore i do not accept that the decision is entirely out of the secretary of states hands interruption well we shall see what happens certainly gloucestershire county council was sparked into action by the governments green paper and is proposing to close the special schools\nif the bill is accepted in its present form it will be a triumph of theory over practice when the people from the school visited the house of commons almost the entire conservative frontbench team came to listen to their views although ministers were asked many weeks ago to attend and were reminded this week not one member of the government team could find even a couple of minutes to call in perhaps that reflects their views on special schools ministers are shaking their heads but i do not know why the invitations were sent out many weeks ago and they were reminded again this week\na young boy called brian beard has not been educated in any school since september because the local education authority will not recognise his parents wish for him to be educated in a special school he was present today as was another girl she was in tears as she described how she simply could not cope in a mainstream school eventually she was placed in a special school and she has developed considerably since she has been there\nfor many children for whom inclusion has taken place it is the correct policy however it is important to recognise the needs of individual children and they and\n\ntheir parents must decide the best place for their education the bill will not give parents that ability it states that if there is no statement the child will have to be educated in a mainstream school the problem however is that local authorities are not efficient in their statementing", "perhaps the hon gentleman can tell me how to do that without bringing it to the attention of the secretary of state and ministers it is my job as a member of parliament to raise issues with them that is what i am doing and what i have done many times before only a few hours ago i got the permission of the young boys parents to one ministers his name and address if they want it i am sure that the hon gentleman has good intentions but the boy has not been educated since september", "my reading of the bill is different i can only base my comments on the experience in gloucestershire since the green paper was published the other parties in the council have got together to drive through a programme of closure of special schools that is the reality we can talk in this place all we want but that is what is happening on the ground i am paid as a gloucestershire member of parliament to bring that to the attention of ministers and i hope that they will respond\nmany hon members\u2014in particular labour members\u2014have claimed that children are being denied access to mainstream schools because of their special educational needs i fully recogonise that that might happen however no parent has written to me about that problem instead many parents inducing those who were here today have complained that they cannot get places in the special schools that they believe their children deserve\nheads teachers governors and pupils at mainstream schools are concerned about the inclusion policy they know that if children struggle in mainstream schools other pupils will suffer as a result they are not being selfish and neither are the parents they merely recognise the reality that children need to go to an appropriate school as one or two labour members stated that has to happen by considering the needs of individual\nlet me tell the house\u2014not for the first time\u2014where i was educated i was excluded in the sense that i did not successfully negotiate the 11plus examination all those years ago i am neither proud nor ashamed of that and if i could have my time over again i would not change the secondary school that i attended it was a good church of england school with a good ethos and it was right for me whether it was the best school in the area is irrelevant\nthe girl who spoke at the meeting earlier today was brought to tears when she said nobody is listening to us we are sat in this place and councillors are sat in shire hall in gloucestershire we come out with fine theories but no one listens to the parents and pupils who know that they are better off in special schools the closure of those schools in gloucestershire makes them wonder why they have elected representatives the parents teachers governors and children in many schools throughout gloucestershire are expressing a clear wish that is being ignored by hon members and members of gloucestershire county council no wonder those people are dubious about the role of politicians and have no faith in the democratic process", "i think that the hon gentleman has the issue upside down people who have children with special educational needs are concerned that their children will not receive an appropriate education can he also tell us why the liberal democrats in gloucestershire have driven through a closure programme since publication of the governments green paper", "they have done their best to close schools", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman for giving way to me a second time and i appreciate the moving examples he has cited however does he accept that similar examples could be offered of children who plead to be allowed to go to special schools", "the hon gentleman went through a long list of charities that he reckons support the bill not one of those charities has contacted me in gloucestershire could it be because they are beginning to see the reality of the governments policy through the wholesale closure\u2014despite the secretary of states denial\u2014of special schools in the county is that why those organisations in gloucestershire do not support the bill", "i thank my hon friend for coming to the jubilee room just before the debate started to listen to the concerns of pupils teachers and parents from alderman knight school in gloucestershire who feel that their school is under threat because of the governments actions does she regret as i do that not a single labour front bencher was able to call in even for five minutes", "if he will make a statement on the current level of paramilitary violence 149949", "according to the detailed written answer that the minister provided me with on 26 february since the signing of the good friday agreement there have been 65 murders 828 bombings 836 shootings and 396 assaults\u2014a total of slightly more than 2000 paramilitary crimes how many of those can be attributed to the main paramilitary groups which are supposed to be on ceasefire", "on how many occasions in the last three years he has changed the methodology for compiling hospital waiting lists and if he will make a statement 147333", "why therefore did my constituent mr clive currie receive a letter from the local hospital dated 30 december last year telling him that his appointment six months later had to be cancelled because of an urgent requirement for appointments why did the same letter tell him that he would not be offered another appointment more than a month before the date for such an appointment fell due is that not a case of keeping people off the waiting list\u2014and does it not coincide with the possible date of a general election", " i ought to declare a registered interest in the tobacco industry but it is a different point that i wish to raise many years ago there was a legal case in which someone sold on a bottle of water or fizzy pop which contained something that it should not and the person who sold it on was held liable is that an accurate analogy mr bruce certainly with regard to product liability one is part of a chain let us suppose that a 12yearold is reading a tobacco advertisement if that advertisement is in le monde which is produced in france the individual who sells it on is according to the legal definition of the word publishing not distributing le monde unless there is a provision to counter that the word publishing includes simply passing it on without even recopying it to another person i hope that the minister will be able to respond to that point as i said it would have been nice to have somebody from the home office sitting on her team who could advise her of the legal definition i am sure that legal advice can be sent for if necessary ", "will my hon friend give way", "it is a pleasure to follow the hon gentleman who i think represents wolverhampton southeast", "sorry i mean the hon member for wolverhampton northeast mr purchase who demonstrated a great knowledge of industry and its failings he referred in particular to some of the weak management in industry i do not need to declare an interest but i worked in industry for most of the 18 years of tory rule to which the hon gentleman referred i shall return to that subject shortly\ni worked for the textile industry for many years it faced many pressures and its decline is sad i agree with the hon gentleman that its management was not all that it should have been we must accept that if manufacturing industry is to return to or at least approach its former glories it must be managed better than in the past that does not apply to all manufacturing industry some of which is managed extremely well\ni disagree with the earlier part of the hon gentlemans speech in which he referred to 18 years of mismanagement by the tory administration i worked in industry in the 1980s and in the 1970s anyone who criticises the conservative governments record on industry should compare the two decades in the 1970s some disgraceful things went on it is no wonder that so many jobs were lost jobs were lost in the 1980s and the 1990s but many were also lost in the 1970s\nworse than the terrible demonstrations of union power in the 1970s was managements fear of managing that emphasises how desperate matters were in industry in those days i am proud that the conservative government introduced changes to trade union law and other changes that transformed industry i would dispute the case with anyone who claimed that the predicament of manufacturing was worse after 1979 than before it is simply not true\ni am sorry that the secretary of state is not here but he cannot be here all the time his speech was contradictory he referred to many job losses that happened in 1991\u201392 in what he accurately described as a recession it was a terrible recession which affected the businesses that i was trying to help the small business that i ran then had a difficult time in 1991 which was probably the worst year of my working life i therefore fully appreciate the pain\nthe conservative government participated in a european experiment called the exchange rate mechanism which was a disaster from which they never recovered the secretary of state would say that the right convergence criteria did not exist then and that we went in at the wrong rate there is no such thing as the wrong rate\u2014whatever the rate it was right but the system was wrong the secretary of state acknowledges that the pound is now even stronger against some currencies joining the single currency would therefore lock us into the wrong system for ever not for christmas not for a few weeks not for two years\u2014the period after which we left the erm with great pain\u2014but for ever\nthe secretary of state listed all the companies that he claims have brought jobs to this country\u2014if they have i welcome that he quoted from the sun i am glad that my hon friend the member for buckingham mr bercow takes it daily he quoted the words\nbritain is the best place in the world to do business\nhowever the right hon gentleman contemplates taking us into the single currency when there is no need to do that if we joined we would lose control over our interest rates and be in exactly the same position as we were in the 1991 recession which the secretary of state condemned i stress that his words are contradictory and simply do not make sense\ni want to consider one or two other matters which i raised in an adjournment debate some months ago such is my interest in manufacturing industry i agree with the secretary of state about the importance of manufacturing industry to the country i shall deal with jobs shortly\nthe secretary of state rightly referred to the industrial revolution it happened a long time ago but it was important because it created wealth when manufacturing developed in terms of mechanisation automation and productivity we all became better off we all know how much cheaper electrical goods are now relatively speaking than they were some years ago productivity improvements in the manufacturing rather than the service sector mean that we are more prosperous and have more goods\nsadly as has been said many manufacturing jobs have been lost in 1950 83 million people were employed in manufacturing now the figure is only 4 million at the most whereas in 1950 41 per cent of the work force were in manufacturing jobs only 16 per cent are in such jobs now that is partly but not wholly due to the\n\n\nimprovements in productivity mechanisation and automation that i mentioned the manufacturing share of gross domestic product has also declined from 37 per cent in 1950 to 20 per cent today\ni have mentioned my concern about the textile industry it remains but it dates from the time when i lived in the northwest now that i represent tewkesbury i am particularly concerned about the aerospace industry although it is doing well and receiving many orders the hon member for wolverhampton northeast mentioned takeovers and mergers which i think the government should consider in detail there were competition worries when british aerospace merged with marconi electronic systems not long ago and i wish that they had been examined more thoroughly\nwhen noting the big orders that the industry may receive will the government also give careful attention to the assistance that foreign governments give companies in their countries i know that we have competition laws throughout europe but i am not entirely convinced that they are being obeyed\nthere are different ways of helping industries there is the launch aid project and governments in other countries especially france provide subsidies and other help the government should be aware of that if we are to have a level playing field in europe we must have a level playing field in every sense of the term i am not sure that our aerospace companies receive the same kind of help as aerospace companies in other countries that is of great concern to aerospace companies in my constituency\u2014smiths industries mossier dowty dowty aerospace propellers ultra hydraulics and others smaller companies supplying those firms are also very concerned\nin an intervention on the hon member for wolverhampton northeast i mentioned the problems experienced by many manufacturing companies in recruiting both trainees and experienced staff i understand from figures supplied by the house of commons library that about 48 per cent of school leavers are going on to university i am pleased that many people now go to university\u2014i did not and i greatly regret it\u2014but when so many are being educated and industry and for instance the technical side of the national health service cannot attract staff something is not quite right\nthe government can do many things to help the manufacturing industries but the biggest thing they can do is stay out of the way we have heard a great deal about competition with companies in europe and the hon member for twickenham dr cable spoke about the difficulties of competing with companies further afield\u2014i think that he mentioned korea therefore the last thing we need is the government piling more and more regulation and taxes on to industry in this country that is the most stupid thing that anyone could imagine\nthe government have already introduced the climate change levy as it is euphemistically called it is actually a tax on energy and many companies have no option but to use the energy sources involved if one is deeply concerned about the environment as i am and wants to persuade people not to do something one should provide them with an alternative rather dim tax them in the absence of an alternative they will not stop doing what they are doing no matter how much one taxes them\n\nif we have not realised that in relation to the duty that is added to petrol it is about time that we started to learn a bit more quickly\nmany of the other laws and taxes that the government have imposed on businesses have hit industry particularly hard such regulations and taxes should be abolished if the government are serious about helping the manufacturing industries the best thing they could do is to stop hindering them by imposing more taxes and laws which is the last thing they need", "the hon gentleman has touched on an important subject in talking about youngsters taking mbas and so on but does he agree that perhaps too many people take that route and not enough take up industrial training given that many companies are finding it extremely difficult to recruit either trainees or trained people", "rose\u2014", "i congratulate the hon member for lagan valley mr donaldson on securing the debate and on all the work he undertakes to highlight injustice in the compensation of victims in northern irelandmany people ask me why i take such an interest in the affairs of northern ireland i have never lived there and have no family there although i make regular visits there are several reasons for my interest one of which is my sense of injustice over certain matters it is always a great pleasure to visit northern ireland and to see how resilient the people are however their resilience should not mean that they suffer injusticethe two should not go togetherwe need to create a climate of peace in northern ireland many people will say that that is what the belfast agreement was all about however it is tragic that during discussions on the agreement when we focus on so many things we tend to forget the victims of the crimes committed from both sides of the divideit is difficult to create that climate of peace while the violence continues we are not talking only of past victimsthere continue to be victims in northern ireland every day in answer to my questions the minister of state northern ireland office kindly supplies figures about the numbers of murders shootings beatings bombings and explosions in northern ireland that reminds us that the violence has not gone away it is important to create a climate of peaceon my most recent visit to northern ireland in november we went to a loyalist area i was with my daughter and her young daughter who will soon be starting school we passed a primary school surrounded by murals in the middle of areas controlled by the gun i shall never forget the looks on peoples faces as they saw the atmosphere in which children in northern ireland have to grow up that is not the climate we want to createsurely in order to counter the violence we must pay more respect to victims when i speak to victims groups in northern ireland they tell me that they do not want retribution but justice yes of course they want the people who commit atrocities to be punishedthey are entitled to expect that justicebut they also want decent treatment for themselves and their families they want compensationthe recent prisoner releases have not helped to boost the morale or to ease the suffering of victims the victims will not go awaynor should they they should never be forgotten the tragedy of the past 30 years in northern ireland is the number of victims who have been createdduring my recent visit the hon member for lagan valley and i spoke to members of the group representing ruc widows some of their husbands had been murdered many years ago but the pain remains the hon gentleman drew attention to the pre1982 situation women who were widowed many years ago have suffered greatly they have struggled financially and personally when i talked to them it was obvious that the pain had not eased the last thing they need is a slap in the facewe must provide help for them where is the justice for themwe should remember that the ruc is not an ordinary police force the officers do not only counter the type of crimes that are committed in englandbad though those are we are talking about the ira an organisation which not only murders people in northern irelandthat is terrible enoughbut tried to bring down the whole british government indeed it tries to remove the british government by force that is the opposition to peace that members of the ruc try to counteri support the proposals made by the hon member for lagan valley i draw attention to the suffering endured by members of the rucespecially that of widows it should never be forgottencertainly not when the government are reviewing current policing in northern ireland as the hon gentleman says compensation cannot fully make up for that suffering but i suggest that such compensationespecially when compared to that given to the criminalsshould certainly not be an insult", "in the early hours of 30 october there was an explosion and subsequent fires at the chemical reprocessing plant owned and run by cleansing services group ltd at sandhurst in gloucestershire because the site flooded soon after as it is prone to do the hazardous chemicals could not be removed from the site for some time many people have since complained of feeling ill and two were detained in hospital for a while afterwards\nthe site has emitted obnoxious odours for years and i and many others including local councillors mark williams and paul ockelton have repeatedly warned about the unsafe running of that plant we were largely ignored yet sadly we were right the chemical works are built on a flood plain the company has shown a disregard for its neighbours and the environment and the agencies have been unable to control it effectively", "the petition was compiled by the chairman of sandhurst parish council mr andrew warren and contains about 2100 signatures\nthe petitioners therefore request\nthat the house of commons urge the secretary of state for the environment transport and the regions to close the site in order to eliminate any hazardous operation with the potential to cause damage to the surrounding environment and populationto lie upon the table", "on 19 december the house accepted a regulation to allow the extension of embryo research which is usually to be done by therapeutic cloning that decision was made on the basis of an assurance given by the minister for public health that reproductive cloning would remain illegal i understand that that statement is to be challenged in the courts it is an extremely important matter especially as the house of lords will consider it next week will the leader of the house ask the minister to come to the house in the week beginning 29 january to make a statement on the outcome of the court case", "what guidance he gives to businesses about protection of their intellectual property and if he will make a statement 144534", "intellectual property theft is estimated to cost industry and business about \u00a38 billion a year\n\n\nand there is also evidence of a link with organised crime the government consulted on this issue 12 months ago and said that they would introduce legislation to strengthen the legal position will the minister say when he intends to do so", "the secretary of state said that i was the only conservative back bencher in the chamber i am sorry to say that that remains the case but i promise him that i am not a token back bencher because i serve on the select committee on social security under the expert guidance of the hon member for roxburgh and berwickshire mr kirkwood i also served on the standing committee considering the child support pensions and social security bill a short while ago so i take an interest in these matters i do not intend to speak for\n\n\nlong but i want to make a few comments about the current situation on pensions and about future pensions i also want to refer to some of the points that the secretary of state made i am sorry he is not in his place to answer my points\nthe more one considers an issue such as law and order or northern ireland\u2014two subjects that i am also interested in\u2014the clearer it becomes that there is no one big answer to any of those problems and that that is so with all aspects of social security especially pensions i share the governments stated objective of relieving poverty among the poorest pensioners although it is difficult to define poverty we all accept that many pensioners are poor especially elderly women their position cannot be corrected in one go because although people may not be particularly poor when they retire given the income that they receive as they get older life becomes more difficult things that they bought new when they were 65 are not new when they reach 80 problems may come about simply because they have got older although the problem may be solved for someone of 65 it could recur when they get older\nwhat the government are doing is not necessarily helping given the spirit of the debate and the fact that christmas is approaching i shall not be too critical or unfair but it is a little easy for the government to say that they are providing the minimum income guarantee so that no one should be on less money than that minimum the government know that many people do not take up the mig\u2014we have heard eloquent speeches explaining why that is so the fact that people do not take it up must be taken into account regardless of the reasons\nat a select committee meeting the secretary of state said that we should judge a system by how effective it is and i entirely agree with him he hung himself with his own words the system is not effective because people are not taking up the minimum income guarantee why are they not doing so i take the point that the hon member for gedling mr coaker made as well as the practical difficulties there are philosophical arguments i accept that those people claim housing benefit and council tax benefit but there is a crucial difference they get bills for rent and for council tax and that provokes some action whereas they have to be proactive to claim the minimum income guarantee although i sympathise with the hon gentlemans view i think that there is a difference if the mig were part of the basic state pension they would automatically claim it because there is a philosophical expectation of that pension they understand correctly that they have paid into the system all their lives and are entitled to claim a pension if they see the minimum income guarantee as welfare they do not believe that they have paid in all their lives for that even though they have there is a very big difference\nit is fair to say that the feeling on the select committee is that the mig is unlikely to be taken up universally unless it is part of the basic state pension i shall quote one of the witnesses to the select committee he may seem to be making a point that is opposite to the one that i am making but i shall explain what i mean\nmr andrew dilnot a director at the institute for fiscal studies said\nif our only concern is targeting the standard of those living on the lowest incomes then we will always be driven towards relying more on meanstesting and less on universalism if our key concern is upholding the dignity of the elderly then we are driven towards universalism\nhe is saying that in theory the meanstested benefit is precisely what is needed for the poorer pensioners but in effect that is not happening the second part of that quote explains why that is not happening it is because it challenges the dignity of people who have to claim the benefit\nthere are also the practical problems of claiming the mig are elderly people whom we accept are probably the poorest in society\u2014whether they are men or women does not matter for the purpose of this point\u2014the most likely or the least likely to claim the minimum income guarantee i suggest that such people by virtue of their age are probably the least likely to claim the mig yet they are the very people who need it it is almost certain that it will fail\nif the problems are philosophical or about practicalities and not about information is the takeup campaign likely to succeed as the hon member for northavon mr webb said the system is not working regardless of the philosophical arguments that we have all made the fact that the system is not working should be taken into account\nwhen preparing its report on pensioner poverty our select committee stopped short of recommending a restoration of the earnings link although many members favoured that one factor was our wish to see how the pension credit system would work before returning to the issue but i warn the government\u2014i hope that the hon member for roxburgh and berwickshire the chairman of the select committee will agree if he catches your eye madam deputy speaker\u2014that we may return to the subject if it is felt that pensioner credits are not doing enough i suspect that the evidence received so far suggests that they will not do enough\nour report called for an increase in the state nonmeanstested pension sooner rather than later it also called for an increase in the basic state paid pension for those aged over 80 to minimum income guarantee level so that the income of the poorest members of society could be guaranteed\nwhen we\u2014members on both sides of the house\u2014are trying to make political points we tend to stress that the united kingdom is the fourth largest economy in the world i am proud that it is but when that fourth largest economy apparently cannot afford to do what it should be doing we should question the motivation that may be involved it horrifies me to think that members of my family might have to claim under the minimum income guarantee and i suspect that other hon members may also not be too happy about the idea\npensioners are clearly not happy about proposals for the future labour members must receive the same letters that we receive pensioners must visit their surgeries as they visit ours they must have heard pensioners complaining about the level of the basic state pension only a few weeks ago in westminster hall\nalthough i have suggested that the basic pension should be increased i recognise the problems posed to continual uprating by demographic changes i speak from\n\n\nmemory but i believe that 50 years ago there were about five and a half contributors to every pensioner i think that the figure is now 18 the minister will correct me if i am wrong those figures suggest that there is a problem\u2014and the figure of 18 is due to fall over the next few years and as we enter the next century i do not accept that we have entered the next century yet i am one of those who think that will start at the end of the current year anyway the figure will fall as we reach 2030 2040 and 2050\ni accept that in the long term we shall find it difficult to provide a basic state pension that will retain the degree of comfort and dignity that the recipients deserve that is why the conservative party wants a pensions system that is funded why have a number of pensioners\u2014not all of course\u2014become better off recently because they have taken up occupational or private schemes although i have made criticisms of the governments approach i accept\u2014as i have said\u2014that it is difficult to provide a basic state pension that enables pensioners to live as they would want to live and as we will want to live when we reach their age\nit is rather disingenuous of any labour member to suggest that we would scrap the basic state pension that is certainly not our policy i am sure that if it were proposed by my hon friend the member for havant mr willetts it would not be accepted by the conservative party and i do not think such allegations serve politicians\u2014or indeed the house\u2014very well\nmany general elections ago we were accused of planning to abolish the national health service we won many general elections and did not do that we have no intention of scrapping the basic state pension now and i would not support it if it were a proposal but saying that is very different from making plans to help and guide people to provide for a better future we betray those people if we do not stress the importance of their making their own pension provisions whatever our argument and on whichever side of the house we sit the fact remains that that is the only way in which those people will enjoy any prosperity in their old age\nit will come as no surprise to conservative members that our proposal to allow people to opt out of the state pension and perhaps to receive a rebate that can be invested in a private scheme is not unique other countries are well ahead of us as i have told front benchers two years ago i went to mexico and studied its pensions system mexico is already up and running in this regard the proposal is not exactly revolutionary\nwhen i was in mexico i asked ministers whether there might not be a bit of a black hole in resources given that those in retirement would continue to need funding they said we feel we can manage that adding we would rather face the problem now than pass huge burdens to our children and grandchildren that i think is a very responsible attitude for a socalled developing country to take but it is too revolutionary for the fourth largest economy in the world", "china of course boasts two systems there is a political system in which people say what they really think should happen and an economic system in which people have come to realise what must happen anyway i am delighted to learn that the chinese are also showing us the way forward\nwe have developing countries and communist countries and here we are lagging behind in the hope that if we are elected on 3 may\u2014or hopefully earlier\u2014we are given a chance to offer people the prospect of a more prosperous retirement\ni have spoken for longer than i intended but i want to mention one or two other issues that concern me the first is that of disability living allowance claims i am sure that all hon members can cite cases of constituents being done down but i believe that in many cases people are making justifiable claims not only are those claims being turned down when they go to appeal the process is stretched out in the case of my constituent mr orrey papers were lost and the case goes on and on my constituent has not been given the correct treatment or the money that is due to him i urge the government to look closely at what is happening especially at the appeal stage\nwe heard a little about how certain benefits would be paid to people of the same age whether they were male or female will the minister tell us his intentions in regard to widows benefit\nas i said i have spoken for rather longer than i intended let me echo what others have said and also wish members on both sides of the house a happy festive season", "i too agree with a lot of what the hon gentleman has said he put his finger on\n\none problem when he said that claiming the minimum income guarantee is a matter of practical difficulties and a philosophical problem for a lot of pensioners i agree that it is a philosophical problem but is it likely that pensioners can be persuaded out of that", "that will not take long", "if he will make a statement on meat imports into the united kingdom 142338", "i thank the minister for that brief statement does she recognise that according to recent press reports some imports from the continent have been from countries with a history of bse and that some of the imported cattle are over 30 months old if that is the case what discussions does she intend to have with eu ministers on that matter", "that is an extremely important point i used to work in charity fundraising and i know the importance of getting an early indication of the refusal of an application one application in my constituency took two years to prepare and was turned down it was probably obvious in retrospect that that would happen but it resulted in two years wasted work", "the village whose swimming pool application was turned down has a population of at least 10000 although i accept that a village of 150 people cannot necessarily expect a lottery grant for a swimming pool that particular area parts of which are deprived and which has a fairly large population should have been considered more seriously", "i want to discuss the regional distribution of lottery grants the debate is i suppose timely given the current news but i do not want to go into the matter of who is to run the national lottery that is a debate for another dayi am delighted to be introducing the debate i met the minister in the summer to discuss my concerns about the distribution of lottery grants the fact that i wanted this debate is by no means a sad reflection on that meeting it is intended to move matters on as we had a very interesting discussion she was helpful and i am grateful for her attendance todaythe national lottery was started six years ago in november 1994 the principal reason was to try to provide funding for undertakings that were not covered by general taxation and therefore to provide benefits to certain areas and opportunities for organisations and projects that might not otherwise be afforded them it appeared to be an exciting prospect and i dare say that it has often proved beneficial there are many opportunities for use of the money such as the opportunity to regenerate certain areas however that approach should not be concentrated just on towns or inner cities there are perhaps better ways to regenerate those placessuch as by getting people to live in them again and by building there rather than in the countryside the point is that rural areas also have projects and organisations that need helprural communities are under threat farming is going through a difficult period there is a threat to some rural post offices shops and pubs the price of petrol is high and that is a threat to livelihoods in the countryside today the hunting debate will pose a further threat i look forward to joining the minister in the same lobby later in addition to aiming to help rural areas we should aim to create sustainable communities i hopealthough i am not sure about thisthat the criteria for allocating lottery funds extend to the creation of sustainable communities rather than just to building houses a load of houses is not a community i should have thought that such an objective was suitable for the national lotteryit is difficult to ascertain the criteria by which each board of the national lottery makes decisions about giving but i know that that sphere of activity is the largest part of the ministers jurisdiction and responsibility in respect of the national lottery i am not suggesting that she is responsible for the grants that are given or refused but she is responsible for setting the parameters and perhaps she will provide more detail on thatthe southwest region is a loser in many respects it does not have terribly good rail links although i suppose most people would say that about their region at present it also receives relatively low funding for education health policing and local government i am afraid that it does not do very well from lottery funding according to figures that i have been given by the house of commons libraryall the figures that i shall give are from that sourcethe southwest received \u00a3113 per capita which is 20 per cent below the national figure of \u00a3140 per capita that puts the southwest eighth out of 12 regions the figures for wales scotland and northern ireland are \u00a3150 \u00a3156 and \u00a3157 respectively some parts of the southwest can claim to be as remote and to have similar difficulties to wales scotland and northern ireland yet there is that huge difference in lottery funding indeed there is a wide range of difference in the regional figures only \u00a376 per capita of lottery money finds its way to the eastern region whereas \u00a3162 per capita goes to the northeast which is 43 per cent more than the figure for the southwest is that difference justifiedto break the distribution down within the regionas the minister knows i have much concern about the money that is coming or not coming to my constituencytewkesbury receives only 258 per cent of all the lottery money coming to gloucestershire which is a total of \u00a3186 million out of \u00a3722 million neighbouring gloucester received about \u00a322 million and even the beautiful cotswold constituency received a total of \u00a316 million i have nothing against the other constituencies in gloucestershiregood luck to them for securing that funding and i hope that they continue to do sobut on a strictly proportional basis tewkesbury has about 17 per cent of the population so why do we receive only 258 per cent of the money coming to the countythere may be reasons and if so i would like to uncover and confront them one might ask whether institutions in tewkesbury are applying for the money of all applications made by the county 15 per cent come from tewkesbury are they asking for enough money of all the money asked for by organisations in the county 14 per cent comes from organisations in tewkesbury so our organisations are making the applications and are asking for sufficient money why then do they receive only 8 per cent of the funds that they ask for when organisations throughout the country receive 44 per cent of the funds that they ask for", "i am grateful to the hon gentleman i hope that he is successful in catching your eye again later mr deputy speaker what he says worries me and i hope that the minister will respond to itthe hon gentlemans intervention was timely because i was just coming on to ask whether the shortfall in funding was due to an unprofessional approach in tewkesbury i do not think that it is is it a lack of support from the council that is clearly not the case i would like to cite two examples to demonstrate my point i declare an interest in relation to the first my wife is a director and trustee of roses theatre so i know a little about its application which was professionally submitted and received financial support from tewkesbury borough council the theatre also put in some of its own money when it was submitted roses theatre was told by the director of capital services at the arts councilyour application was assessed against the published criteria and was recognised to have some merit yet it was turned downa second project for a swimming baths churchdown village in my constituency was also professionally prepared i have a copy here and hon members will notice the size of it we would need much more time than we have available to go through it all it goes into minute detail again the application was well supported by the local borough council churchdown is one of the largest villages in england with a population of just over 10000quite a big area it is not terribly prosperous and has few facilities but its bid was turned down the senior case manager at sport england said that it was turned downprimarily because the proposed facility would fall within a 20 minute drive time of a number of other swimming poolswhen i raised that response with the minister she said that it was nonsense and she was right for three reasons first children cannot drive secondly we are supposed to be trying to reduce car journeys and thirdly we need to build sustainable communities and if people have to drive out of their communities to enjoy facilities we are not doing thatwe are simply building loads of houses on green fields which does not constitute a communityother bids from my constituency have also been turned down including those for playing fields in bishops cleeve a jet age museum at staverton and a heritage centre at tewkesbury the battle of tewkesbury took place in 1471 as part of the wars of the roses although the yorkists won that battle they did not win the war like churchdown and the rest of the southwest region tewkesbury is not a particularly prosperous area the regional distribution of lottery funding is unfair and the distribution within the region certainly as it applies to tewkesbury is unfair as welli ask the minister to look into tewkesburys funding in great detail will she review the giving criteria and ensure that sensible criteria are adhered to will she monitor the regional distribution of lottery funds and donations within the region i also ask her to assess the reasons for refusalsthere will be repercussions from what is happening in my area and perhaps in the rest of the southwest if organisations feel that they have little likelihood of success they will become dispirited and give up people such as councillor brian jones who was involved in both the bids to which i have referredroses theatre and the churchdown swimming poolput so much into the community and should not be treated as they have been money will not reach the areas that it should unless there is fairer distribution of lottery funds organisations in tewkesbury could be forgiven for asking what on earth they have to do they receive only 258 per cent of the money that goes to the county which is unacceptable people in tewkesbury play the lottery just as much as people in any other part of the county and should benefit from it equally 1242 pm", "before the minister leaves the legal aspect of the matter is it her understanding that the cell nuclear replacement technique is legal at present even though it has not been attempted yet", "i am grateful to the minister for explaining that matter very clearly but may i take her back one step she said that cloning is illegal but am i not correct in saying that that is dependent on the authority it is not enshrined in primary legislation if i am correct when does she intend to introduce a bill to enshrine in primary legislation the fact that cloning is illegal", "if he will make a statement about the discussions he has had with european union ministers about the raxen programme 141962", "i thank the minister for that reply i am sure that the whole house shares the governments\n\ndesire to stamp out racism and xenophobia but is not that organisation trying to stamp out the undesirable emotions that the european union itself is creating the creation of a european army and other moves that take us towards a european superstate such as economic and monetary union are likely to foster xenophobia and racism is not the real way to combat those undesirable emotions to allow each independent nation state to remain exactly that independent", "the right hon lady rightly mentioned that conflicts hold up the development aid that we provide will she comment on the conflict in ethiopia with relation to development aid", "i thank the deputy prime minister for visiting tewkesbury last friday to look at the flood damage his visit was greatly appreciated he will recall that i stressed the additional problem experienced in the small village of sandhurst in my constituency where there was an explosion at a chemical factory\u2014a couple of days before the floods thankfully if it had occurred during the flooding the emergency services would not have been able to reach the area\nwill the minister carry out a full investigation into that explosion including the reason why a chemical factory was allowed to be sited on an obvious flood plain as my hon friend the member for southeast cambridgeshire mr paice pointed out to build houses on or near flood plains causes many problems one reason why councils do so is the pressure to accommodate the number of houses that they are asked to provide", "i shall ask a question about the comprehensive spending review will the prime minister tell my constituents not how much extra money will go into health and education but how it will address the postcode lottery and bring about a fairer funding formula for education\u2014both areas in which my constituents in tewkesbury are disadvantaged", "if she will make a statement on her policy towards development aid to ethiopia 127737", "i am grateful to the secretary of state for that reply she is right to bear in mind the conflict that took place between the two countries however it is urgent to renew development aid because the last thing that we want three four or five years down the line is a repeat of the situation that we have just seen in ethiopia will she therefore think very carefully about how she can speed up the development aid that that country so desperately needs", "if he will make a statement about the current level of farmgate milk prices 127037", "the minister mentions that several factors have affected milk prices and those include the weak euro and the recent depressed prices of skimmed milk and butter a third factor is structural problems does the minister now regret encouraging the breakup of milk marque and if so will he explain what he will do to put the situation right", "i pay tribute to the work that went into producing the report although i regret the fact that it was necessary i regret that this debate is necessary despite the excellent speeches that have been made from both sides of the house\nthe government have a record of leaving a constitutional mess with devolution we still have the west lothian problem with which we have to wrestle to try to recreate the fairness and balance that used to exist in the constitution we are also wrestling here to find a solution to a problem that need never have existed when we voted on whether to retain 91 peers in the ridiculous mishmash house of lords that we now have i voted against that and would do so again in an ideal world we would not start from here but the fact that the house of lords and the constitution of this country have been\n\n\naround for such a long time makes them different from the constitutions in other countries therefore direct comparisons with for example the usa are not really relevant\nthe house of lords has many strengths that have perhaps not been brought out in the debate the independence of mind of many of the peers although they sit technically as conservative or labour has often been demonstrated by the fact that they have voted against measures put forward by this government and by the previous conservative government", "i do not think that that is the case but i shall not try to explain why because i am short of time\nas i said the house of lords has many strengths i am sure that hon members listen to and read the reports of debates in the house of lords the quality of which is sometimes superior to the quality of debate in this house we should not discard that strength\npeople might ask how i can justify the continuance of a house of lords that is not democratically elected if i believe in democracy i can do so because as has already been pointed out the house of lords has virtually no powers it can delay legislation and send it back here to ask us to think again but at the end of the day it can do no more therefore i do not mind that it is not elected so long as\u2014as my hon friend the member for teignbridge mr nicholls said\u2014the whole parliamentary package is democratic ultimately the democratic will of this house is always supreme which is why i can accept an undemocratic house of lords\nwhat are we trying to achieve when we talk about democracy electing people is democratic but do we represent the views held across the country i sometimes wonder whether this house achieves that many views are held in labour constituencies that are not represented by the elected members for those seats the house of lords in its present form and perhaps in an evolved form can provide a greater representation of some of the wider views found in the country\nwhat would we achieve by having a second elected chamber lord wakeham is a former conservative chief whip and at a meeting i attended he expressed concern about the whipping arrangements in parliament he did not want to reproduce in the house of lords the whipping arrangements that prevail in the house of commons and we should not let that point pass without serious consideration\nif we had now a house of lords dominated by elected labour members who were whipped as such where would be the check on the labour executive in this house it would not exist alternatively if we had a conservativecontrolled house of lords of elected members who wanted to show their strength we could have gridlock i do not accept that the parliament acts would be safe in such circumstances rather we would leave ourselves vulnerable to the discussions in smokefilled rooms between certain senior members of\n\nthis house and certain senior members of the house of lords where would we have gone what would we have achieved\nas time is short i will finish by making a suggestion for all its faults i suggest that we continue with an appointed house of lords i am concerned about how those appointments would be made i am concerned about quotas and would seriously object to them although i would want to see every opinion in the uk represented i would balance that by bringing in on an elected basis people from organisations the heads of churches charities employers organisations and trade unions could provide a balance that might then restrict the powers of the people who would make the appointments\nit is not an easy question to answer speaking as someone who will never inherit anything i think that we should have carried on with what we had there is an argument for that but we must now look forward", "i am not sure of its effect on the average age but people tended to inherit peerages at a much younger age than that at which they were appointed to them", "my only concern is that with a greater number of elected lords the upper house would become more like the house of commons so they would behave exactly the same", "i find myself in the uncomfortable position of agreeing with the right hon lady as a believer in democracy i find it acceptable for the house of lords to be unelected while its powers are extremely limited surely that is the point", "if he will make a statement on the takeup of income support by pensioners 124953", "i am grateful to the minister for that reply however is it not true that the poorest pensioners are in fact the oldest pensioners is it not also true that the oldest pensioners are probably less likely to take up income support or the minimum income guarantee given the governments stated objective of helping the poorest pensioners would it not be a failure of the minimum income guarantee if that were the case would the problem not be alleviated if pensioners\u2014or at least todays pensioners and older pensioners\u2014received a better state pension", "rose\u2014", "i am grateful to the secretary of state for giving way to a humble back bencher he must be the only member who does not receive lots of communications from pensioners all saying that they want not gimmicks but a decent pension surely that is the basis of our proposal", "does the minister recognise that the two recessions that she referred to\u2014those in 1988 and 1991\u2014were caused by the conservative government trying to skew the economy to keep the pound at artificial levels the problem is not the fluctuation of the exchange rate but that sterling is at too high a level locking sterling into the single currency would mean that that situation existed for ever rather than just for a brief time as was the case under the exchange rate mechanism", "during this adjournment debate which i am pleased to have secured i hope to talk about matters equally as interesting as hamburgers of which i am a great eater i thank the minister for attending especially as manufacturing industry was discussed at length yesterday i shall try not to repeat any of those remarks\ni have initiated the debate because i have a manufacturing background although i have no interest to declare these days however i have worked for about 80 different companies as a consultant most were manufacturing companies and a lot were in the textile industry i want to consider the background to manufacturing discuss the problems that the industry faces and perhaps touch on a couple of local issues that affect my constituency\nsince the industrial revolution the wealth of this country and individual prosperity have increased greatly because of developments in manufacturing such as automation and mechanisation it is relatively difficult to improve the productivity of a restaurant or of service industries but increased wealth can be achieved by improving manufactured goods industries and through the world trade that that facilitates service industries are not easily traded internationally but it is relatively easy to trade manufactured goods although it is crucial to be efficient in world terms in other words better manufacturing performance makes goods relatively cheaper and makes us all better off that is the battleground and therefore that is where we must concentrate\nmanufactured goods also represent about 63 per cent of our exports so they are extremely important in terms of national earnings and the relative wealth that is created for the people of this country however i am concerned by some manufacturing industry statistics which suggest relative decline indeed some are startling the manufacturing industries employed 83 million people in 1950 and that figure remained relatively stable for about 20 years today they employ only 4 million to put that into perspective manufacturing employed about 41 per cent of the work force in 1950 i do not want to be party political but the government have said that 160000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the election and the percentage of those working in manufacturing has fallen from 18 to 16 per cent\nthere are other problems companies find it difficult to recruit school leavers who find the computer hightech and financial services industries far more attractive many potential recruits have been lost over the past 20 years or so because at one stage employing young people became expensive that mistake should not be repeated and i shall return to that point\nwe have to accept that productivity increases and mechanisation have in part caused the decline in the number of people employed in manufacturing industry and manufacturings share of gross domestic product represents another depressing statistic in 1950 manufacturing provided about 37 per cent of gdp\n\ntoday that figure is 20 per cent and falling it would be easy to say that industrial workers have been very greedy at times that has been the case but using the same dates in 1950 wages in manufacturing were about 104 per cent of the average wage\u2014slightly above average today they are about 99 per cent so it is not true that manufacturing workers have priced themselves out of work\nsome of the decline that i have spoken of is relative it is due to the growth in service industries however the demand for manufactured goods is on the increase these days many families do not have just one car quite a few have two or sometimes even more there are colour televisions not just in one room in a house but sometimes in two three or even four likewise computers mobile phones and pagers\u2014mine is being a nuisance at the moment\u2014are commonplace so there is a great call for manufactured goods there is a market for more and more goods the saturation point with manufactured goods is much higher than that for the service industries\nall that is borne out by the level of imports twenty years ago manufacturing made up about 50 per cent of all imports now the figure has risen to 67 per cent at the same time although there has been greater demand for services domestically the level of services imported has been static because it is more difficult to import services because of that we are retaining service industry jobs but losing manufacturing industry jobs however it is manufacturing that creates the added valued manufacturing has not declined because there are no orders or because no one wants manufactured goods\u2014far from it it has declined for other reasons\nmay i suggest several ways in which the government might help manufacturing industry first it has been right to concentrate on the car and coal mining industries recently but there are many other industries in the country\u2014perhaps not high profile and perhaps a lot smaller but they require recognition of what they contribute to gdp and indeed to the wealth of the nation thousands of jobs in for example the textile industry my old industry have been lost recently\nsecondly it is essential that instead of increasing taxes the present government\u2014indeed all governments\u2014should cut taxes taxes stifle enterprise put up costs and drive jobs abroad a particular example is petrol in the united kingdom which i understand starts off as the cheapest in europe but when tax is added to it ends up the dearest\nthirdly some countries that are far less efficient than us are catching us up because they are less regulated again many regulations that have been introduced by the government although well intentioned will not help companies stopped employing and training youngsters as i have said because it became too expensive to do so partly because of the wages councils that existed at that time i would not want further regulation and burdens to cause industries to employ even fewer youngsters\nfourthly it is important that we understand industry it is extremely difficult to make things deadlines are tight and margins are low the quality of manufactured goods rightly must be very high fifthly we should ensure that european competition rules are not being broken by other countries on the continent when we try to comply with them so strictly sixthly we should pursue policies that would enable interest rates to be reduced and therefore\n\n\nthe pound to fall in value although it seems that the weakness of the euro as a currency will always be a problem\u2014at least it will be for the foreseeable future\nwhile i am on europe my final suggestion is that the government should avoid economic and monetary union at all costs we should be more competitive than europe and not the same as europe if we are just the same as europe as regards addon costs for industry employing people tax wages and everything else why on earth should companies come to the periphery of europe they would build factories in the centre of europe we must be different from europe and indeed better than europe\ni want to mention two local issues that are to do with manufacturing industry and of which i have given the minister notice a company in my constituency called ultra hydraulics has employed 252 people it is owned by an american company\u2014a joint venture between commercial intertech and its partner parker hannifin in ohio one of the partners has been systematically transferring work from tewkesbury to chemnitz in germany with the consequent loss of 252 jobs\nthe parent company blames sustained losses the strength of the pound and the prevailing economic conditions in this country but it also blames the incentives being offered to it by the german government to relocate there will the minister consider those incentives are they legal i should like an assurance from her that she will look into the matter\nmy second point on a slightly more positive note concerns the a400m airbus project i welcome the longawaited decision to order 25 of those planes should the project go ahead british jobs\u2014again many jobs in my constituency\u2014will depend on it but they will also depend on fair competition rules we need to ensure that any help that is afforded to companies in france particularly but on the continent generally is also available to companies here british companies should not be disadvantaged in this respect in the case of aerospacetype work in particular the setup costs are very high our government should give at least as much help to our companies as say the french give theirs the minister must persuade the europeans to follow suit and pledge to support the project otherwise the project simply will not go ahead and obviously jobs will be created and safeguarded only if it does go ahead\ni am not asking for intervention or state control in manufacturing industry the industry made itself great and government interference is often the problem rather than the solution but governments can create the right conditions which i am asking this government to do i am looking for a recognition of the value of manufacturing to the economy and to our wealth generally i am looking for an understanding of how hard it is to manufacture goods so much can go wrong and as i have said the margins are so slim especially when some workers in the world are earning trifling amounts in wages and yet producing the same goods i am looking for lower taxation and less burdensome regulation and i am looking for a determination to make british manufacturing prevail again", "unless the amendments are accepted the bill will discourage people from becoming good employers after all the government have said about encouraging people to be good employers they should accept such amendments which will enable people to become good employers by encouraging them to look after their staff\nmy hon friend the member for havant mr willetts gave some good examples of charging income tax but not national insurance he could have gone on to say that tax but not national insurance is charged on salaries that are above a specific amount there are many different ways of viewing the matter it is wrong of the government to suggest that there are precedents and that if something is subject to tax it automatically has to be subject to national insurance that is wrong and inconsistent\ni believed that the government intended to encourage employers to provide child care facilities we have sat here time and again and listened to such proposals i would therefore be surprised if the government did not accept amendment no 62\nour national health service is struggling and we have to find not only more private provision but more money for the health service we should therefore try to do that if we are to build the sort of health service that everybody wants and that people rightly demand nowadays we have to find new ways of putting money into the health service or any health care provision it would therefore be rather perverse to discourage employers from providing money that would relieve the strain on the health service\nwith those few remarks i support amendments nos 62 and 63", "when i was first elected a great many people came to my surgeries to\n\ncomplain about the csa\u2014not only about its mistakes but about calculations that were not done and about cases dragging on and on it may be dangerous to say this but i find that there are fewer cases coming to my surgeries now\nin view of that i hope that we are not being premature with some of the changes that we are making in the bill which undoubtedly creates a system of rough justice many changes in the bill are to be welcomed but we may come to regret creating such a system", "i am not quite saying that but my hon friends question leads to an interesting point i hope that i may test your patience slightly mr deputy speaker by drawing an analogy\u2014", "i understand mr deputy speaker i am grateful to you for your guidance and to my hon friend the member for new forest west mr swayne i had not appreciated how helpful he was being", "in view of that advice i shall turn straight to the detail of new clause 27", "i am sure that it is wise to do so\ni support new clause 27 which would be very useful it would concentrate the minds of those at the csa charged with ensuring that money finds its way to parents with care so that children are helped and with ensuring that people are not charged unfairly the performance measures that the new clause could be said to be introducing would be very effective\ntarget times are all well and good but we must be aware that in some circumstances it might not be possible to meet such a target the reasons may be outside the csas control\u2014for example it may not be possible to get the relevant information when that happens it would be far better to extend the time a little than to drop the case and allow the costs already incurred to fall to the taxpayer that is not something that i support\ni am in favour of the new clause but i think that we must keep something of an open mind about the possibility that the time limit might have to be extended sometimes my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar mr pickles spoke about empowering people and the new clause would empower people to receive what they are entitled to in that way the taxpayer would\n\n\nbe relieved of the burden the new clause would also mean that the nonresident parent\u2014the one who does the paying\u2014would receive the justice that he deserves\nall hon members know that delays cause many problems and mean that parents with care and their children have to live without support in the cases that i have dealt with many problems have been caused by arrears building up and the compensation provided for in new clause 27 might well have to be set against those arrears", "i entirely agree in many cases compensation had it been paid would have relieved greatly the suffering of aggrieved parents regardless of which side of the argument they were on\nintroducing time limits could prevent some of the problems that can be encountered the threat of violence between the parties was mentioned earlier i do not suggest that the new clause would remove such threats but recognising and dealing quickly with them would lessen the risk of violence there would also be less risk that people would disappear into the community and never having to pay a penny for their children interruption", "thank you mr deputy speaker i am sorry that hon members do not find my remarks terribly interesting but they may come to be seen as important\na time limit would also simplify the system if people are aware that the csa means business and that it will sort out a case in x number of weeks they might be more prepared to provide information especially when they realise that compensation might be payable\ni understand what the right hon member for birkenhead mr field said about compensation being paid for by the taxpayer would the government also consider in certain cases asking for compensation from a party who has withheld information i accept that that may be going slightly wide of the new clause but it might be a way of preventing problems from arising in the first place", "if he will make a statement on the plans to extend qualified majority voting at the intergovernmental conference 104199", "is not the alternative to extending qualified majority voting for the european union to engage in fewer matters and to interfere in fewer areas of our national life does the secretary of state recall that the previous labour government promised that the british minister would always have a veto and that it was only on that basis that the british people ever agreed to be members of the european union in the first place", "does the hon gentleman agree that the schemes are changed because of their huge cost to the exchequer and the fact that the ratio between those drawing pensions and those paying into the schemes changes is that not their weakness and does it not point to the fact that the funds to which my hon friend the member for havant mr willetts referred are a far better option", "if he will report on the progress of the governments proposals to tackle child poverty 102930", "is not the worst thing that a child can inherit from its parents a belief in the welfare dependency culture and are not the governments policies increasing welfare dependency is not the best lesson that children can be taught the lesson that welfare can provide only a very basic standard of living and that the phrase work ethic constitutes of itself an important concept", "if he will make a statement about the average waiting time for heart bypass surgery 102274", "i am grateful to the minister for that reply will he perhaps explain or look into why one of my constituents was told nine months ago that he would have to wait between seven and nine months for such an operation only to be told a couple of weeks ago that he would have to wait a further 12 months is that typical or is it an unusual case", "what plans he has to meet the chairman of the inland revenue and hon members to discuss tax issues relating to compensation given to former land settlement tenants 101771", "i thank the minister for that reply at some stage however ministers have been involved in the matter although the minister quite rightly said that the award was made by maff in the early 1990s the then minister said in a letter to the chairman of the inland revenue that\nit was quite clearly ministers intention at the time of the settlement that the outofcourt payments were intended to compensate the extenants of the lsa for personal hardship \u2026 it was not therefore intended as taxable compensation for loss of earnings\ni really do think that the minister should get involved in resolving what is clearly a gross inequity", "what discussions he has had with the government of russia concerning the war in chechnya 99966", "i thank the foreign secretary for that reply however does he share my alarm at the deterioration of the situation since he spoke to foreign minister ivanov there has been further aggression and there are predictions that the war could last for many months the citizens of grozny have been told to leave by saturday the foreign secretary acknowledged that that was unacceptable and i am sure that he knows that many people in grozny cannot leave\u2014many are old or sick or terrified of leaving the city in case they are caught up in the bombing the russian authorities promise of a safe corridor is worthless will he convey to the russian\n\nauthorities in even stronger terms\u2014such as those that he used to the authorities in kosovo\u2014the seriousness of the situation", "if he will make a statement on his plans to integrate pupils with special educational needs into mainstream schools 99349", "i thank the minister for that reply but does she accept that some local authorities are going too far and trying to include in mainstream schools all children with moderate learning difficulties\u2014a term that underdescribes the problems of many children does she further accept that not all children with special needs can be integrated and that each child should be treated as an individual will she join me in condemning those local authorities that are trying to close special schools in their area", "does the hon gentleman agree that one way to increase voter participation is to introduce teaching about government and politics in schools\u2014not at 16 for alevels but at the age of 11", "does acting as a local councillor qualify as voluntary work if so should a local councillor be able to collect disability benefits", "rose\u2014", "on special educational needs will the secretary of state pay tribute to the special schools will he confirm that he believes that a number of children simply cannot be integrated into mainstream schools because of the difficulties that they have", "i apologise for being unavoidably late and missing most of the opening speeches i was of course present for the queens speech i shall deal with only one aspect of it this evening so i shall probably not take up the full time allowed to me\nthe queens speech referred to the plan to introduce a bill in respect of special educational needs we look forward to seeing the bill although i am not sure what it will contain i take a different approach to that taken by the hon member for meirionnydd nant conwy mr llwyd who is not in his seat\nthe government introduced the subject of special educational needs in a green paper some time ago and called for further integration in principle that is a good theme but it has its limits one of the dangers of integrating pupils with special educational needs into mainstream schools is that that can be taken to an extreme\u2014as is happening in gloucestershire where the liberal democrat and labour groups are bringing about more integration than is good i support the principles of integration and inclusion but even more important is that education should be appropriate and that should take precedence over integration and inclusion\ni want to speak for a moment about my education which should not take long because it was not that great i am probably one of the few hon members perhaps the only one to have had the distinction of going to what was called a secondary modern school having failed to negotiate successfully the 11plus nevertheless it was an appropriate school for me and i had good academic and moral education however parental choice is now under great assault grammar schools and grantmaintained schools are under assault and special needs schools are in danger of coming under assault such an assault would be most inappropriate because integration is not always the best option\ni declare an interest in that my wife is the conservative education spokesman on the county council and recently she has been much involved in special needs debates i also have a godson who is profoundly deaf he has been to both special educational needs and mainstream schools but he found it difficult to cope with life in a mainstream school and had to go back to a special school\nduring the debate in gloucestershire my wife and i received many messages of support for our belief that not all integration is appropriate those messages came not only from those from whom one would expect them to come but from head teachers teachers governors parents and children children wrote to us saying please keep our school open their letters were often difficult to read because they were so emotional\nalderman knight a special school in my constituency with special pupils does a marvellous job but everyone connected with that school feels that it is in danger of being closed because of existing integrationist policies as well as anticipated measures in the bill many pupils at that school have special educational needs and some also have a physical disability creating yet another special need in itself such children need special care attention education and understanding which only special schools can provide i am in no way doing down mainstream schools but they cannot provide such care attention understanding and education they do not have the resources expertise training time or patience to cope not only children with special educational needs but mainstream pupils can suffer in such schools special needs pupils could be subject to bullying and ridicule and could become disruptive causing everyone to lose out the option of a bolton unit to a mainstream school for children with special educational needs would be even worse discriminating further against such pupils and exacerbating any problems\ni hope that in my short speech i have made the point that while we all want children with special educational needs to be integrated and included as far as possible there are some children for whom that is not appropriate i hope that when the bill is published it will not be driven by dogma or financial considerations", "i very much enjoyed the deputy prime ministers contribution but i am confused about the governments policies and objectives for transport i am not sure whether they want to increase the revenue to the exchequer\u2014the right hon gentleman implied that that was a priority\u2014to have an\n\n\nintegrated transport policy or to achieve sustainable development the government have certainly succeeded in increasing the revenue to the exchequer and the motorist has inevitably been hit hard as a result however they have failed to implement an integrated transport policy and to achieve their sustainable development objective\ni declare an interest smokers receive a poor return on the amount of money that is spent on health care to treat smokingrelated diseases compared to the amount that they contribute to the exchequer the same is true of road users because they contribute far more to the exchequer than they ever receive back in money spent on roads\naccording to a written answer from the minister for transport for the most recent year for which figures are available the exchequer received a total of \u00a335 billion from all taxation levied on vehicles and those working in the industry however only \u00a318 billion a mere fraction of the sum that is collected is spent on roads the motorist like the smoker therefore gets a very poor return on his investment that situation is made worse by a number of other government policies\nfirst the amount that the motorist is being asked to contribute is increasing the insurance premium tax has from this month been increased from 4 to 5 per cent the fuel escalator which the government increased continues to apply however the amount of money spent on roads is by comparison static in fact in a recent discussion members of my local county council complained to me that because the funding rules have been changed they are left with a decreasing amount of money to spend on b roads and small country lanes forcing them to allow those roads to deteriorate\nsecondly there are further threats to the motorist in the form of direct charging for road use or charges for workplace or supermarket parking when motorists already contribute such a huge amount to the exchequer why should they pay more for something that they now enjoy in other words a charge to enjoy a new road is one thing but charging motorists to use roads that they have already paid for time and again is quite different\nthe government have increased the amount paid to the exchequer by road users but have i accept improved the ratio of return to those road users on what is paid out by them the government have failed however to provide the motorist with an alternative to car use they have failed even to begin to devise an integrated transport policy i am not sure that anybody knows what that term means although i am certain that nobody is benefiting from it in spite of all the discouragement through taxation car usage remains stubbornly high and a great deal of freight remains on the roads\ni shall give an example which i am sure all hon members will recognise my constituency is only a twohour drive from london or at least it used to be but now the dedicated bus lane in the fast lane of the motorway\u2014or what cb enthusiasts used to call the suicide lane\u2014has considerably slowed my journey the only cars that i have seen using that lane are taxis with one passenger so i am not sure what it has achieved\nwhat are the rail alternatives for travelling from tewkesbury to london i could catch the train from cheltenham which usually involves changing trains twice along the way the service is extremely unreliable and it would take at least an hour longer than my car journey\n\nfollowing a discussion with members of the county council i asked the minister for transport what discussions she had had with railtrack and the providers of the rail services she replied that there had been no discussions there is not therefore a great deal of encouragement to use the trains", "i have had a great deal of discussion with them because of all the complaints that i have received about the level of service i do not seem to be making any headway which is why i went to a higher authority and asked the minister to intervene until the date of that written answer she had not done so but i hope that following this debate she may be persuaded to intervene\ni have referred to the enormous sum\u2014\u00a335 billion\u2014that is taken from the motorist of which \u00a318 billion is spent on roads and \u00a326 billion on alternative travel there is not much encouragement for anybody to do anything other than drive his car\ni sit on the environmental audit committee and i would welcome any move to reduce car travel and protect the environment if that were possible the corrunittee interviewed the minister about that and i am not sure whether the government want to shorten car journeys to reduce the number of car journeys or to make those journeys cleaner there is a difference between those objectives and their achievement would require different policies\nreducing the level of vehicle excise duty on cars below 1100 cc may have captured a few headlines but it has achieved very little if the government had been serious about reducing the levels of emissions from cars\u2014in other words if their policies had been environmentally rather than economically driven\u2014they would have set the level at 1500 cc engines however i accept that these days there is no direct correlation between the size of an engine and the emissions from it again we have a headlinegrabbing policy that means very little\ni am advised by the government that average emissions from cars with engines below 1100 cc are equivalent to 139 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre and from cars with engines between 1500 and 1600 cc 160 g if the level of ved had been reduced for vehicles with larger engines the policy would have encompassed more people however the exchequer would have lost out and that is the point\u2014the governments policy is economically rather than environmentally driven\nthere is no doubt that the motorist has been hit very hard by the governments policies with no benefit to the environment and no alternative transport provided for the motorist rural residents and those on low incomes who have to use their car to travel to work have been hit particularly hard as always those who can least afford it are made to pay the most i have no objection to sensible consistent policies to entice motorists to use other forms of transport but we shall not achieve that by using the blunt instrument of high taxation on its own", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for beckenham mrs lait on securing this debate and on the detailed way in which she gave examples of where police funding is inadequate it is a pleasure to follow the hon member for stroud mr drew who made the case for extra funding for gloucestershire i want to mention that the fact that there are three members of parliament from gloucestershire in the chamber suggests that things are not well with police funding in that county\nthe general funding of public services leaves something to be desired the labour party spent 18 years telling the public how the conservatives had underfunded public services but now that we have a labour government we still have similar problems it is not only the police who are suffering in gloucestershire despite the highprofile figures about health service spending the health service in gloucestershire is having to make \u00a355 million worth of cuts because of inadequate funding tewkesbury borough council has had its grant reduced causing it to increase the council tax it has been named and shamed by the government for reacting to a problem that the government brought about the same is true of police funding\nthe national pay award over which each force has no control was 35 per cent for 1999\u20132000 price inflation was 22 per cent yet gloucestershire constabulary has been given an increase of only 14 per cent again as with the health service the government have made a highprofile pay award with which very few people would disagree but they have not funded it that causes a big problem\nwhy has gloucestershire been given such a derisory award is it because the government are diverting money from the shire counties to areas in which their more natural supporters might live every shire county apart from two has suffered realterm cuts the minister might find that amusing but it is not amusing to those who live in shire counties as the hon member for stroud said gloucestershire has suffered the fourth largest realterms cut to its operational budget i am aware of the problems in the labour areas to which the government seem keen to divert money because i was not born in tewkesbury but i am also aware of the problems in rural areas", "i would be called to order if i went too far down that route but my hon friend is absolutely right\nthere are difficulties with crime in rural areas for example all gloucestershire members have received a note from the chief constable about drugs and drugrelated crime that is becoming as much of a problem in rural areas as in urban areas the sparsity of policing in rural areas encourages that crime", "perhaps i have underestimated the funding problem\nthe 2 per cent efficiency saving is being taken into account when grants to constabularies are being calculated as the hon member for stroud said the 2 per cent target includes police pensions and security elements over which chief constables have no control a 2 per cent saving nationally may be achievable but it is difficult for each force to achieve it locally for example the police force in gloucestershire has to provide security for the royal family we are delighted that they live there and the force receives a grant to cover the cost but given that minimum standards of security must be provided that should not be taken into account when calculating the 2 per cent efficiency saving\ngloucestershire has already made many efficiency savings it has one of the lowest figures in the country for officers retiring through ill health sickness levels are below average and it has the smallest number of superintendents given all that why has gloucestershire received a realterms cut where is the money to come from as we have already heard gloucestershire police have had to increase the precept by 19 per cent that makes it look as if it is a local problem when it is not also the chief constable has told all the gloucestershire members of parliament that cuts are having to be made in operational areas is that what the government intended i do not remember their claiming at the election that there would be cuts in the operational services provided by the police the minister must look at what is happening on the ground and not just at statistics which may appear to be okay on the surface but do not reveal all that happens in the policing of counties", "what discussions he has had with the indian government regarding the persecution of christians in that country and if he will make a statement 86572", "i thank the minister for his reply is he aware that on 13 january this year more than 140 bishops in india wrote to the president saying\nchristians are being maligned and persecuted and a wave of hatred is being spread against them\nis he also aware of reports in the press about the vishwa hindu parishad which is currently operating illegally in india and also collecting money in the united states and this country and is alleged to be persecuting christians on the back of the money that it is raising", "given the level of alarm that the minister has expressed given the fact that people are starving in the world not because of a shortage of food but because of distribution problems and given the environmental risks that we must inevitably be taking does the minister agree that there is no rush to develop these foods", "is that not the purpose of local councils", "such a proposal may be an attempt to fudge the issue but is it not slightly more sinister it is very convenient for there to be all these regions given the governments intention to create a federal europe of regions", "the hon member for bury north mr chaytor was with me in america a year ago does the hon member for south thanet dr ladyman agree that the american approach of producing cleaner cars is the way forward because taxes have not persuaded people not to drive", "i am sure that my hon friend will recognise that the same problem exists in other parts of the country for example gloucestershire has far more in common with hereford and worcester than with what is termed the southwest for which cornwall and devon are given priority and gloucestershire loses out", "i am grateful to the minister for showing his customary courtesy in giving way his remarks form the thrust of what i am saying will the minister reject what the county council is saying locally he has referred to the broadbrush approach of the inspector but the building of houses on the green belt and in the open countryside was promoted that is why the report is contradictory and flawed", "i am pleased to be able to introduce todays debate on housing projections for gloucestershire a subject that has occupied much of my time since i was elected almost two years ago my postbag contains many letters from constituents who are concerned about protecting not only the villages and the areas where they live but the entire county they are not nimbys but are genuinely concerned about ensuring that we pass on to our children at least some and preferably most of the beautiful countryside that we have inherited we had the privilege of inheriting the countryside and we have no right to deny future generations such enjoyment and quality of life\nlet me make it clear at the outset that in line with most adjournment debates i do not intend to make todays debate party political i am not interested in scoring political points by arguing about which party wishes to build fewest houses or can boast the largest area of green belt however i shall first highlight some of the contradictions between the policies espoused by the government and their actions and those of their inspector in respect of gloucestershire secondly i shall describe the nonsensical process that still occupies gloucestershire county council and the inspector in attempting to agree a structure plan and thirdly 1 shall describe the effect that building a large number of houses in gloucestershire will have on the environment and the countryside there\ni shall start with the contradictions on 3 february this year the government tabled an amendment to a motion in the house it was in the name of the prime minister and the secretary of state for the environment transport and the regions the government emphasised their determination to protect the countryside and spoke of\nthe governments continued commitment to protecting the countryside including green belts\nyet in gloucestershire the government inspector in his examinationinpublic report on the countys structure plan actually promoted the idea of building in the green belt\nthe government amendment also spoke of\nthe governments commitment strictly to control development in the open countryside\nit is poor english i know but even worse the same government inspector promoted the idea of a new settlement in the open countryside that the government said they wanted to protect\nparagraph 63 of the governments draft planning policy guidance ppg3 states\nthe government is not against new settlements\nso on the one hand the government boast of their commitment strictly to control development in the open countryside yet on the other they say that they are not against new settlements where do the government think that those new settlements will be built if not in the open countryside where does the government inspector think that the proposed new settlement in my constituency in gloucestershire will be built if not in the open countryside\nfurthermore in the government amendment and in the new ppg3 the government spoke of promoting development in existing towns and cities and building\n\n60 per cent of future houses on brownfield land but what happens in areas with very little brownfield land such as gloucestershire do the government then approve building on greenbelt land on green fields and in the open countryside what are the governments policies in those cases i would suggest that more clarification is needed so too is a reappraisal by the government inspector following his eip report in gloucestershire\ngloucestershire county councils structure plan proposed building 50000 houses by 2011 that meant 9100 new houses in my tewkesbury constituency the government inspector considered the structure plan and then\u2014some would say led by developers\u2014proposed 55000 houses for the county due to his muddled thinking that would mean 12000 extra houses in tewkesbury how can that increase be justified how can it be right when the area has so few brownfield sites in writing his report was the inspector\u2014and the government office for the southwest\u2014not aware of the imminent publication of the revised household projections which suggested that the southwest will require 49000 fewer houses than was originally predicted if so why did he then propose 5000 more houses for gloucestershire\nthe county wanted 50000 houses the inspector wanted 55000 and the county council is considering the matter further it has already put 100 modifications to the structure plan to public consultation and has suggested to the public that 53000 is the right figure i heard this morning that that figure is being amended to 50000 what a complete farce the problem is that despite the consultations the people who live in gloucestershire\u2014the electorate\u2014actually have a very limited say on the matter because the inspector and the secretary of state have the power to overturn the decisions made by the democratically elected councillors and to ride roughshod over the wishes of the people who live in the area\nin other words there is a gaping democratic deficit in the whole planning process in addition a great deal of taxpayers money has been wasted in the course of the process in gloucestershire\u2014and it is nowhere near finished\ni therefore suggest that the secretary of state use his powers wisely if he did he would properly educate his inspectors before sending them out into the country and allowing them to contradict the very policies that the government are proposing he would explain the meaning of sustainable development to his inspectors and he would ensure that a vast amount of taxpayers money was not wasted on smokescreen planning processes i would also suggest that the secretary of state carefully consider the actual effect of his target of 60 per cent of new housing being built on brownfield land i appreciate that he has increased the figure from 50 per cent and i applaud that but the new target is of little comfort to the people of gloucestershire who will probably have to endure about 90 per cent of new building on greenfield sites leaving only about 10 per cent to be built on brownfield land in tewkesbury probably 100 per cent of new building will have to be on greenfield sites the minister shakes his head but i cannot imagine where houses will be built in tewkesbury if it is not on greenfield sites\nin other words it is all well and good setting a national target of 60 per cent but i would suggest that a target should be set for each county thereby adding meaning and substance to what is at present mere philosophy again ppg3 suggests that local areas should have such a target but what does the minister intend to do in areas which have very little brownfield land available such as gloucestershire will he allow them to build fewer houses again the action should match the rhetoric\nthe position in gloucestershire needs reviewing for a number of reasons including the shortage of brownfield sites in the county the attractive countryside the building that has already taken place the fact that much of my constituency sits on a flood plain there are many other reasons not least the recently published household projection figures for all those reasons the inspector or perhaps the secretary of state should be reducing the number of houses required for gloucestershire not increasing it\ni understand that only this morning the county council proposed to reject the eip figures and stick to the original 50000 houses as in its structure plan therefore i hope that the secretary of state will take no action against the council because if he does he will be acting against the people of gloucestershire that would fly in the face of democracy and common sense and would further contradict the governments stated policy of wanting to protect the countryside\na high housing figure for gloucestershire would put pressure on the borough councils to build houses in the most inappropriate places in tewkesbury where the recently published local plan was based on a lower housing figure the council proposed building houses in an historic town which already struggles with too much traffic and cannot take any more cars on its small lanes in a village where permission was once refused because the land was deemed to be unsuitable on hundreds of peoples allotments in two separate villages where such building threatens coalescence and again on greenfield sites and in the open countryside\npeople say of course we need houses\u2014but we do not know how many already the 44 million prediction is being shown to be too high and who can tell whether the trends of recent years will continue couples may not continue to break up as frequently as they do now and house sharing may become more commonplace than it is now as the secretary of state said on 29 march in a written answer to a parliamentary question\nsuch trends can and do change\u2014official report 29 march 1999 vol 328 c 471\ni was born in a town in northwest england and lived there for 33 years before moving to live in the countryside so i feel that i understand the needs of both town and country i feel also that i understand homelessness as before i was elected to the house i ran a major project to help homeless women in london however homelessness has little to do with a shortage of houses\u2014the issue is much more complicated than that therefore even if we built too few houses people would not become homeless because there were not enough houses\nbuilding millions of new houses creates a selffulfilling prophecy in which houses are built house prices are therefore restrained and\u2014hey presto\u2014people buy those houses however that does not mean that those houses\n\nwere needed initially therefore i welcome another statement in the amendment that i mentioned earlier saying that\nthe government recognises the need to replace the previous predict and provide approach to the issue of household growth\ni genuinely welcome those words and look forward to welcoming the action i should unreservedly welcome such action if i were to witness it so far there has been no change in the approach\u2014although the secretary of state in the written answer of 29 march also said of the predict and provide process that that policy is dead it is not dead\neven if higher housing requirements are justifiably predicted they cannot necessarily be provided\u2014and definitely not in every single area of the country\u2014if we are to retain at least some of the countryside and avoid causing great damage to the environment more houses means more damage to the environment it means more cars and more car journeys which further damage the environment\na compromise available to the government might be to encourage renovation of older properties how many houses stand empty across the country how many flats above shops stand empty which if renovated could help to regenerate towns and cities but what encouragement is given to renovating existing properties when the value added tax rate on such renovation work is 175 per cent whereas no vat is chargeable on new houses built on greenfield sites the government should correct that perverse situation by removing vat from renovation work and by charging vat at the top rate on new build and greenfield land\nwe should not neglect the countryside and the environment in the clamour to build new houses especially when they cannot be shown to be needed wanting to protect the countryside and to preserve green fields hills dales farm land and beauty is not mere romanticism as such an environment is one of the things that makes life worth living we cannot continue taking land for building for to do so would be to turn the united kingdom into an undesirable urban sprawl with the countryside being lost for ever to current and future generations", "if he will list his official engagements for wednesday 10 march", "given the prime ministers motion to the house on 3 february stating that the government had a commitment to protect the green belt and open countryside and to increase the number of houses that were built on brownfield land does he still support that policy if so given that my constituency of tewkesbury has few brownfield sites can he tell me why his own inspector proposes in his report that a disproportionate number of houses be built in tewkesbury and that thousands of houses be built on the green belt on green fields and in the open countryside is that not yet another example of the government saying one thing and doing another just as in yesterdays budget", "answer", "does not the hon gentleman remember the pain caused to people with mortgages and businesses in this country when yes the conservative government tried to shadow the deutschmark and to remain in the exchange rate mechanism does not he remember that when we entered there were dm295 to the pound and that the rate then dropped before regaining that level does he accept that it was not the rate that was wrong but the system", "will the hon gentleman give way", "what plans he has to review the standard spending assessment system with particular reference to the area cost adjustment in connection with education 68881", "i thank the minister for that encouraging reply i remind her that the scheme means that kent for example benefits in purely educational terms to the tune of about \u00a3265 million year and that oxfordshire similarly benefits to the tune of about \u00a382 million a year however gloucestershire oxfordshires neighbouring county loses out by about \u00a32 million a year will she look at the iniquities of the scheme", "does the hon gentleman agree that one way to increase the perceived importance of town councils would be to give them a greater say in the planning process like me the hon gentleman comes from gloucestershire so he will be aware that peoples views expressed through the town councils are being overridden by unelected inspectors", "i am rather amazed to find myself talking at this hour about the scottish enterprise bill", "with a name like robertson i am perhaps entitled to offer one or two words on the bill\n\nwhen i looked at the bill i was even more amazed the thing that caught my eye was the extraordinary amount of money that we are talking about\u2014not just the extra \u00a31 billion but the almost \u00a33 billion that has already been spent i welcome the removal of ministers ability to increase the amounts by statutory instrument but i want to make a short speech that my hon friend the member for west dorset mr letwin might describe as a probing speech i wish to ask a few questions and seek clarification\ni am concerned that responsibility for scottish enterprise will pass to the scottish parliament it is not a matter of whether the scots the english the welsh or people from northern ireland are competent to deal with their own affairs but the amount of money is so enormous that it inevitably comes from the united kingdom taxpayer should not the united kingdom parliament have some control over it if labour members feel that the money is well spent and benefits the people of scotland to such an extent would they be happy for the people of scotland to provide it in its entirety if they are i suggest that the scottish parliament would need to increase the tax in scotland by more than the 3p in the pound by which it is entitled to increase tax i wonder whether it would have been better to delay introduction of the bill until the scottish parliament was up and running the responsibilities would have been clearer", "if that happens that may well be the case i have probably presented only one half of the equation because i am only a quarter of the way through my speech who will pay the hon lady makes a good point will scottish enterprise be selffinancing what returns can we expect from the new companies that are created which otherwise would not have been created that has to be the question what will they contribute in terms of corporation tax job creation and jobs retained\u2014which is important\u2014and in terms of inward investment attracted in other words is this money well spent\ni wish to put the amount into context my hon friend the member for west dorset mentioned the number of nurses who could be employed by the extra money the \u00a34 billion over the period in question would run the health service for quite a few weeks the health service employs about 1 million people in that context the figures quoted this afternoon are not impressive", "thank you mr deputy speaker for rescuing me from going down a complicated path\nmay i put the \u00a34 billion in another context i was saying how many people it could help and how long it could run the health service for example which employs 1 million people but given that the entire population of scotland over the age of 16 numbers just over 4 million and the economically active population is only 25 million it seems an extraordinarily large sum to spend on such a small work force that is not to undervalue that work force my argument is whether it is money well spent the money might be better spent elsewhere as the hon member for galloway and upper nithsdale mr morgan might have been suggesting or perhaps left in the pocket of the taxpayer who knows how to spend it better than governments\na number of differing figures have been quoted this afternoon they also differ from the figures that i shall give in an earlier intervention i quoted the chief executive of scottish enterprise i shall do so again for the benefit of hon members who were not in the chamber then he claimed in the annual report that scottish enterprise has helped to attract inward investment of \u00a31 billion and created or retained 18000 jobs and 36000 training places yet he says\nscotland \u2026still lags behind the rest of the uk in the number of businesses emerging\n\nthe chairman of scottish enterprise sir ian wood says that scottish enterprise has\nadded \u00a3600 million to scotlands gdp\nthose figures may sound impressive but compared with what scottish enterprise has cost they are not impressive at all the agency has not moved scotland on very far will the minister assure us that the money will be well spent and will result in gains to scotland that are proportionate to the cost of the schemes", "i have used a number of benchmarks the best of which is the fact that the chairman of scottish enterprise sir ian wood says that it has added \u00a3600 million to scotlands gdp however if one averages out what the agency has cost since its creation that \u00a3600 million is not impressive one must ask how much of it would have existed had the money not been spent in the first place\ni shall bring my remarks to a close because i am interested in hearing the ministers response will he assure us that the value for money of scottish enterprise will be constantly monitored", "i do not wish to appear churlish but the point that my hon friend the member for west dorset mr letwin was making was that although all that may be true it is at an enormous cost in spite of what the hon gentleman has said in the scottish enterprise annual report the chief executive said\nscotland however still lags behind the rest of the uk in the number of businesses emerging", "i too am amazed that despite the wording of our motion the governments amendment does not address it the speeches that we have heard tonight have not dealt with our arguments\na small amount of government revenue is involved yet it is made up of sums that are extremely significant to some of the poorer pensioners it is hard to believe that any government would set out to penalise the poorest in society i for one hope that that is not the governments intention and that they will change their mind on that policy\nthe removal of advance corporation tax is a shortsighted act that has many knockon costs and it will hit many people and many organisations the scrapping of personal equity plans and taxexempt special savings accounts is an unnecessary and unsettling change they are popular schemes and are open to everybody and they seem to have been scrapped simply for changes sake the removal of dividend tax credits from the poorest pensioners and nontaxpayers is yet another totally unnecessary act\nthese changes will affect many people\u2014the poorest pensioners future pensioners and ordinary savers\u2014and organisations such as churches charities and local councils but the principal point is that they will also hit companies and hit them in the way that the government say they will not the government say that they want to encourage investment but as far as i can make out the measure will reduce investment in industry and in business\nfor example if there are no tax advantages why should organisations and people\u2014especially poorer people\u2014invest their money where an element of risk is involved the tax advantage through act credits and tax relief on dividends makes that risk acceptable the change may persuade nontaxpayers to put their money where it is completely safe but that would deny that investment to industry and business\nthe government seem to be somewhat embarrassed by the changes that they have made first many labour and liberal democrat members have signed the earlyday motion which is almost identical to our motion secondly last june the then paymaster general said\ni am aware also of the growing anxiety among poorer nontaxpayers who have been hit by the measure\u2014official report 30 june 1998 vol 315 c 175\nthe chancellor himself talked about not introducing the change until 1999 to allow people to reinvest\u2014precisely the point that i am making people will take money out of equities and out of industry and reinvest somewhere else\nthe government look to be further embarrassed by the difficulty with replying to letters we have written on behalf of constituents i wrote to the chancellor about this issue on 22 july 1998 in spite of chasing him for a reply many times i have yet to receive a reply the government seem to be extremely embarrassed by the measure because of that\u2014and more so because it would be the right thing to do\u2014i hope that they reverse it", "at the time i and several of my hon friends asked the government why the paramilitaries would give up their arms after all the prisoners had been released what reason would the paramilitaries then have to give up their arms since the government would have played their trump card", "the home secretary referred to dentists as i have just returned from the dentist i hope that he will forgive my lack of verbal dexterity does his dislike of the hereditary principle extend to the monarch", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for north essex mr jenkin on securing this debate on such an important subject and on using the time allocated so wisely as i realise the enormous value and importance of tourism to the united kingdom\u2014especially to london which itself draws in much tourism to the united kingdom\u2014i should say first in a nonpolitical speech that our hereditary monarchy and hereditary peerage are extremely valuable and important to tourism in london\nas i said tourism is important to london and tourism in london is important to the united kingdom however london is not everything in tourism also with great respect to hon members who have already spoken in the debate seaside resorts are not everything in tourism we have to market the other parts of the united kingdom abroad and to market uk tourism inside the united kingdom\nlike my hon friend the member for north essex i am concerned by plans to abolish the english tourist board what will replace it we have heard that responsibility for tourism may be given to regional development agencies i am troubled by such a proposal for various reasons the first of which is that my constituency will be on the very edge of the southwest rda which will also include cornwall and devon the southwest rda would tend to promote cornwall and devon\u2014i have nothing against those areas\u2014at the expense of other parts of the region\nmy constituency and gloucestershire generally have far more in common with herefordshire and worcestershire than with devon and cornwall and there is a strong likelihood that we in tewkesbury would lose as a part of the southwest region if responsibility for promoting tourism is given to rdas or to any similar regional authority tewkesbury would lose i do not want that to happen\ntourism is extremely important to the town of tewkesbury to the cotswolds to many other villages in the area and to the racecourse in my constituency in tewkesbury excluding the racecourse 12 per cent\n\nof jobs depend on tourism compared with the national average of 7 per cent tourism is a vital factor in job creation and sustainability in education and in the preservation of old buildings\ntewkesbury has many old buildings however it also has many shops that have closed primarily because of a shortage of tourists although tewkesbury is a very beautiful and historic town it suffers from proximity to cheltenham which has many chain stores the town of tewkesbury therefore specialises in and relies on speciality and novelty shops on the abbey on its many old buildings and on the river although those aspects of the town are extremely important\u2014some of them are very beautiful\u2014that is not enough they have not only to look attractive but to draw in trade\ni should like to stress again the importance of tourism both to my constituency and to the united kingdom", "i was interested to hear the ministers reply in gloucestershire there is pressure to close a very good school alderman knight school which provides an excellent service for children with special educational needs as the minister will be aware many of those children also suffer physical disadvantages will she make it clear to all local education authorities that the policy she has just stated to the house is the governments policy there is much doubt in leas about what that policy is", "what discussions he has had with representatives of independent financial advisers regarding the investigations into the selling of pensions during the 1980s 56868", "is the minister also aware of the personal investment authority ombudsmans practice of charging ifas \u00a3500 every time a complaint regarding\n\npensions or other financial services products is made against them even if the complaint is not upheld\u2014if it is found to be frivolous and thrown out\u2014the company cannot claim back that \u00a3500 that is surely not natural justice", "i wanted to take part in the debate because i believe that a major injustice is being inflicted especially on independent financial advisers on some insurance companies and possibly on a great many policyholders\nlike many hon members who have spoken i make it clear from the outset that people who were genuinely missold pensions need compensation and we must all support any moves towards that to provide adequate and fair compensation without destroying many independent financial advisers and without penalising other policyholders the review must be fair i believe that it is not\ni shall outline some ways in which the review is unfair both in its concept and its application there is an automatic assumption that pensions were missold indeed the title of the debate is personal pensions misselling the letter that companies are forced to send to their clients is headed your pension were you badly advised misselling is presumed to have taken place before the company has even had a chance to get a response from its clients it is assumed to be guilty in every case without those cases having been proven\nconsideration of how the process starts perhaps explains what i am getting at the client does not approach the company with a complaint as is the case in every other walk of life the company as we have heard has to write to all its clients in a prejudicial way inviting them to request a review of a policy which they may have been totally happy with\nthat process not only undermines companies and the industry which is not in the best interests of the public but is grossly unfair and against the spirit of natural justice companies are required to badger their clients into requesting reviews even though many of them have shown and will show when contacted that they have no interest at all in such reviews\nonce a request for a review has been received the review begins and firms are in the words of the economic secretarys letter to hon members dated 14 october required to put matters right if they have broken rules in force at the time of giving advice and if the investors concerned have suffered financial loss in my view however the rules which prevailed at the time the advice was given were not rules at all\u2014they were guidelines\npeople in large companies were employed to sell pension plans although as i said in an intervention that is not strictly true because they were selfemployed and existed on that basis with the blessing of the regulator and the inland revenue they were not taken on as advisers nor as consultants they were salesmen who often worked on a commissiononly basis and were rewarded when they made sales and fired when they did not there are differences between the way in which people were allowed to operate at that time and the stricter conditions that they now have to work under\nthe practice of best advice was introduced in 1986 but if the regulator had been serious about ensuring that best advice was given he should have introduced a\n\n\nprofessional qualification for financial services at that time i understand that such a qualification exists now but it was barely a requirement for the selling of insurance products during the period covered by the review\u2014 1988\u201394\nit is therefore questionable whether the rules referred to in the ministers letter were broken it is my submission that 10 years on it is virtually impossible to assess exactly what advice was given and even more difficult to judge that advice against the background and the economic conditions that prevailed at that time\na judgment on whether a pension was rightly or wrongly sold should be made against growth rates at that time and not against current rates a personal pension plan sold in 1988 may have appeared to all concerned far more attractive an investment than it does now especially given the raid that the labour government have made on act credits\nthe advice given during the period in question was somehow supposed to take into account factors that could not have been known at the time the decisions taken at the time must be put in context it is not right to penalise someone for giving the best advice at that time even if it did not turn out to be correct it is a longstanding principle of british justice and democracy that legislation should not be retrospective it is not fair to judge the sales of pensions in the 1980s against the standards and penalties that apply in the 1990s\neven if it were possible to look back 10 years accurately a financial comparison cannot be made the review must compare the actual and stated provision offered by an occupational pension scheme with the likely benefits of a personal pension plan however that is not a comparison of like with like growth rates have fallen from their 1988 level personal pension plans may compare less favourably with occupational schemes at todays level but what if growth rates increase over the remaining life of the pension plan how would the two then compare it is impossible to say so it is impossible to satisfy the second requirement in the ministers letter\u2014 that a financial loss must have been suffered by the investor before compensation is payable\nthe only time such a judgment can be made is when the person retires and draws on that pension a comparison made in any other way is pure guesswork and is unfair to the firm and possibly to the policyholders it is like accusing someone of murder when the victim has not yet died\nthat is especially so during the second phase of the pension review which considers the cases of younger people younger people may have 30 years to go before they claim their pension how on earth can an estimate be made of what their pension will be worth in 30 years time what about the effects of inflation younger people will not stay in one job\u2014as people did years ago\u2014and that will have an impact on the value of an occupational pension personal pension plans are flexible in that they are linked to the person not the job occupational schemes for all their merits are not\nare charges for a transfer from one occupational scheme to another to be taken into account when assessing the relative values are they judged separately for every person for whom the review is being carried out\nprecisely how has that been carried out how do the regulators know to which company individuals are likely to transfer or for how long they will stay in their present job to which the occupational pension is linked\na further consideration when making a comparison between occupational and personal pensions is the viability and sustainability of occupational schemes some schemes which could be called inout schemes have recently come under pressure and their continued funding puts pressure on the resources of the services provided by the organisations that run them the teachers pension scheme and the police pension scheme are two such examples are those carrying out the review able to judge the financial and nonfinancial aspects of the respective schemes i suggest that that is impossible\nwhat about the other benefits that a private pension plan offers which are not merely financial such benefits include the flexibility that such a plan offers allowing policyholders to draw their pension at any time between the ages of 50 and 75 how many occupational pension schemes offer that degree of flexibility\nprovision for early retirement is now threatened in a number of these inout schemes is allowance made for that when calculating the respective worth of occupational schemes and private pension plans\nwhat about the deathinservice benefit comparisons people dying in their 20s would undoubtedly have more money credited to their estates from occupational schemes than people in private schemes but people dying in their 50s could have accumulated far more capital in private schemes than they would have in occupational schemes how have the regulators assessed that factor\nnot only is it difficult to assess whether the rules have been broken and whether a policy holder has suffered a financial loss it is difficult to assess who should pay compensation for any misselling that may have occurred we have heard various views on who should pay but all the larger companies will do is pass on any compensation payments that they make or any fines that they pay to the withprofits policy holders companies ability to do that is unfair on the small independent advisers whom the industry itself advises people to consult in preference to single companies independent advisers have no one to whom they can pass on costs in such circumstances they will simply go out of business\ni ask the government to look at the way in which the second phase of the review in particular is being conducted all that i have said so far relates to the past but i would add that the financial services industry is extremely important to the country if people lose faith in it that will be to their great detriment i urge the government to ensure that such a thing does not happen again by stating that a recognised professional qualification must be obtained before anyone is allowed to become involved in the industry let me stress the need to protect the innocent companies that have worked so hard for so many years so that they do not have to go out of business owing to a heavyhanded approach to regulation", "the hon gentleman describes the employment of salesmen in those days he will recall that they were often not employed at all but were selfemployed that was legal does that not suggest that the conditions under which pensions were sold in those days were very different from the conditions now", "does my right hon friend agree that with personal pensions as well as financial considerations two other benefits are to be taken into account first they are completely portable and secondly they allow for a 25year retirement age many occupational pensions would not have those benefits should not that be taken into account when assessing their value", "it is a pleasure to follow the hon member for stroud mr drew who is my neighbour in gloucestershire i endorse his comments about predictions of the number of houses that will be required because i also have doubts about them trends change including the divorce rate the number of people living alone the age at which young people leave home and other factors affecting mobility which makes the figure questionable to say the least\nto address the need for houses is to ignore the need to protect the countryside i am as aware as anybody of the need to provide homes for people because before i entered the house i carried out a large project for the homeless they were homeless not because they could not find homes to buy but for other social reasons as my hon friend the member for aldershot mr howarth said if we continue to build at the current rate the countryside will fill up when that happens will we then try to provide homes in a more sustainable manner if so why not address the problem now\nthe word sustainability is overused and underobeyed but the government should interpret it to mean providing for the needs of todays generation without prejudicing or compromising the needs of future generations to protect future generations we must take a radical approach now and not merely pay lip service to sustainability destroying the countryside\u2014and creating increased traffic and social problems\u2014while ignoring the needs of inner cities and town centres is not sustainable\nthe pressure to build more and more houses causes many problems in tewkesbury which has been forced to accommodate far more than its fair share of housing recently that has led to the destruction of several attractive villages part of the reason is the difficulty that some districts have in providing brownfield sites pressure to build in tewkesbury has led to land that had been declared unsuitable being reconsidered for example peoples allotments and greenfield sites have been built on and other land which if built on would lead to villages coalescing is now being considered for the same fate i endorse the comments made by the council for the protection of rural england that the local environment must be taken into account when building in rural areas sustainability means developing brownfield sites and derelict sites and empty and old buildings not destroying the countryside and ruining lives\ni do not wish to be party political but i believe that the governments policy is inadequate the government adopted the previous governments projected figure but they did not need to do so the government have set up regional agencies without giving them the full responsibility to protect the environment and have also set a worryingly low target for building on brownfield sites regardless of party politics the planning of the building of new houses needs a radical rethink if it is to be sustainable", "will the hon lady give way", "i approach the matter from the fundamental position of objecting to the creation of a new category of prisoner in the united kingdom that is one of the main reasons why i shall vote against the bill tonight\ni would have liked the bill to link decommissioning with the release of prisoners for two reasons first i believe that the electorate in northern ireland have been misled\u2014i shall not go into that issue more deeply as it has been covered already secondly if we are releasing prisoners i believe that this is the best opportunity that we shall have of securing decommissioning the minister said last night that he hoped to see decommissioning in the future what will we trade at that point to secure decommissioning\u2014the government will have surrendered their ace without receiving anything in return\nthe government may claim that they are getting something in return ceasefires and peace but they are of value only if they are genuine and permanent i invite hon members to cast their minds back to an earlier ira ceasefire when the sinn fein president reminded a crowd who had gathered that the ira had not gone away would he have said that and would his remarks have been relevant if the ira had decommissioned at that point i suggest that if the ira had decommissioned the ground would have been swept from under him and he would not have been able to make statements such as that\nwhy would any organisation want to retain arms there can be only two reasons either it wants to use the weapons again in the future or it intends to use them as a threat to move northern ireland further down the road to a united ireland\u2014which i believe this agreement takes us some way towards", "the hon gentleman says that there is a great deal of ambiguity about the bill but does he agree that there was no ambiguity when the agreement was sold to the people of northern ireland by the government they were led to believe that prisoner release\u2014", "if he will make a statement on the discussions he has had with the indian and pakistan governments in relation to nuclear tests 44522", "as the testing has serious implications for the environment for peace and indeed for trade will the minister clarify press statements that india is prepared to sign up to some parts of the test ban treaty if no progress can be made will he assure the house that he will take every possible step to ask the united nations security council to take whatever measures may be necessary", "what discussions he has had with vehicle manufacturers about the steps they are taking to reduce emissions 43261", "i thank the minister for that answer the government of the united states are working with approximately 300 manufacturers of cars and car components on the programme for a new generation of vehicles the americans and the japanese seem to be more advanced than we are with the development of alternative fuel vehicles has the minister had any discussions with those governments if so has that advanced our position", "will the leader of the house ask one of the education ministers to come to the house to clarify the position of grantmaintained schools the labour party has always been a strong opponent of grantmaintained schools saying that it would return them to council control however in a parliamentary answer to me the government now deny that that will happen in the press this week the government said that schools would be given more of their own funds to control will ministers explain the exact position so that schools parents and the house might be aware of it", "if he will review the ban on the sale of beef on the bone 42729", "does the minister not think it rather odd that in northern ireland beef can now be exported but beef on the bone cannot be eaten", "will the home secretary give way", "i am trying to follow the home secretarys line of thought but i am finding it a\n\n\ntouch inconsistent a few moments ago he said that it was important to define which religious bodies would benefit a religious charity being governed so strictly by the charities legislation would have a close definition will the right hon gentleman accept from someone who worked for a religious charity before entering the house that a great deal of good work is carried out by such charities that may not be strictly religious but which makes it vital that those charities are able to employ people of religious thought", "the hon member for banff and buchan mr salmond will have a reduced work load nevertheless i would not suggest that he should take a lower salary\nthe public tend to attach importance to how much people are paid they tend to judge the worth of persons or organisations on the basis of how much income they receive\u2014perhaps the reason why the public do not value members of this parliament highly is that we are inadequately paid but that is another argument it is important that members of the scottish parliament do not receive higher salaries than members of the house of commons it is important that the salaries they are paid recognise what i maintain will be a lower work load and less responsibility\u2014interruption", "thank you mr deputy speaker\u2014the subject is an interesting one\nit is important to preserve the subordinate character of the scottish parliament and to prevent it from becoming a quango that feathers its own nest it is vital that we preserve the union and doing as the amendments propose would be consistent with the precedent set by the european assembly pay and pensions act 1979 to which i referred our amendments would achieve all that they would ensure fairness and in doing so protect the union for those reasons i commend amendments nos 22 23 and 21 to the house", "i beg to move amendment no 22 in page 35 line 24 at beginning insert\nsubject to subsections 6 to 8 below", "the amendments are intended to ensure that no salary or allowance paid to a member of the scottish parliament shall exceed that paid to a member of this house that no salary or allowance paid to the first minister shall exceed the average paid to a secretary of state in the united kingdom parliament and that no salary or allowance paid to a member of the scottish executive other than the first minister shall exceed that paid to a minister of state in the uk government\nthose are the details of the amendments the reasoning behind them is to protect and strengthen the union to reflect the fact that the scottish parliament is a\n\nsubordinate legislature and to recognise that the work and responsibilities of members of the scottish parliament are different from those of members of this house\nthe amendments are in keeping with the precedent set following elections to the european parliament in 1979 the work load and responsibilities of members\u2014", "the hon gentleman is either extremely well informed or very unlucky because i used to be a time and motion person and i assessed work loads each and every day if he will allow me to proceed i will explain my view\nit cannot justifiably be claimed that members of the scottish parliament will have the same work loads or the same degree of responsibility as exist in this place that is especially true of the additional members whose presence will reduce the work load and responsibilities of those who represent constituencies as we heard today the government recommend that the two different sorts of member should be paid the same therefore it is only right that members of the scottish parliament should not receive more pay than members of this house and our amendments will ensure that that is the case\nas for the first minister i am aware that the secretary of state for scotland has his eye on the job but i am confident that he could survive on a salary of no more than \u00a3106716 which is what he receives as a cabinet minister in the united kingdom government", "it is indeed a precedent and one which i am about to mention\ni do not believe that anyone is suggesting that the pay of the first minister should exceed the figure i quoted our amendments will ensure that it will not\nunder our amendments members of the scottish executive could receive up to \u00a377047 in pay i am equally confident that no one would suggest that comparably that would be inadequate however there is a deeper point about salaries which is that the scottish parliament is essentially a subordinate parliament and therefore it would be very odd indeed to pay its members more than members of the supreme and sovereign united kingdom parliament\nour objection to that is not born of greed or resentment but of a desire to protect the union because the scottish parliament is new and people have high hopes of it there may be a temptation especially if the parliament is\n\n\ndominated by scottish nationalists to attempt to enhance its standing one way to do so would be by paying its members more than members of this house receive which would be an odd and dangerous thing to do\nin those circumstances the comparable link would be broken and that would weaken the union it is important that the subordinate character of the scottish parliament be maintained and be seen to be maintained if we are to preserve the union therefore a cap needs to be applied to what members of the scottish parliament receive and our amendments would do exactly that\nas my hon friend the member for solihull mr taylor said there is a precedent which is the european assembly pay and pensions act 1979 it limits the salaries of members of the european parliament to those paid to members of this house a conservative government passed that act but the labour party supported it on second reading the then shadow home secretary merlyn rees said\ni believe that to have paid the new members of the european assembly higher salaries than those of members of this parliament \u2026 would have been an affront\nhe was right but his reason for taking that view was even more important he said\ni agree with the home secretary that in no way should the european assembly detract from the supremacy of this parliament\u2014official report 22 june 1979 vol 968 c 1679\nthat is the crucial point lord merlynrees was right for more than just one reason the fact is that he realised that paying higher salaries to members of the european parliament than those paid to members of this house was objectionable for constitutional reasons those same objections exist in the case of a scottish parliament the public tend to place importance on how much people are paid", "we are not certain\u2014because the questions have not yet been answered we do not know how things will work we are still searching for an answer to the west lothian question so we do not know how the arrangements will work in practice we shall have to wait and see but i certainly do not recommend that any members of this parliament should have to take any reduction in pay", "i beg to movethat leave be given to bring in a bill to provide for the deregulation of racecourses\nin introducing this bill i am required to declare an interest i am a member of cheltenham race course which costs me considerably more money than it brings in as a result of my interest in racing my family and i receive hospitality from race courses and connected organisations\ni should like to be able to claim that the bill is a major piece of legislation but i hope that the fact that it is not will not mean that the house hesitates to give me leave to introduce it in fact the bill is supported by hon members from three political parties in the house and i am grateful to all of them for that support i am also grateful to the undersecretary of state for the home department the hon member for knowsley north and sefton east mr howarth who has been extremely helpful and encouraging during our discussions i should also like to place on record my thanks to those at the british horseracing board\u2014which featured deregulation in its financial plan\u2014the racecourse association the tote and cheltenham race course for the help that they have given me in preparing the bill\nthe bill would deregulate race courses in great britain so that they might be in a better position to exercise the measures of selfhelp that the racing industry itself encouraged by the government recognises it needs to pursue before turning to the detail of the bill i hope that the house will allow me to describe the background that makes the introduction of such a bill so necessary\nthe horse racing and bloodstock industry is extremely important to this country in all racing and betting combined secures employment for more than 100000 people and racing provides the exchequer with a contribution in taxation of almost \u00a3500 million a year five million people attend race meetings each year and racing and horse race betting have a combined turnover of more than \u00a35 billion a year\nthe racing industry has assets of \u00a32 billion and contributes more than \u00a390 million a year in exports in my constituency of tewkesbury the cheltenham race course at prestbury park has an annual turnover of \u00a310 million and when the income received by guest houses pubs restaurants and hotels is added the value of racing to my constituency alone becomes immeasurable\nthere are those who say that all in racing is going well and yet another successful cheltenham festival last month might encourage such a point of view but alas all is not well in racing many smaller courses\u2014those where owners trainers jockeys and horses start their careers\u2014are not doing so well crucially prize money at those courses is low often yielding as little as \u00a31300 for the winner of a race given that the annual upkeep of a horse is about \u00a314000 it does not require much knowledge of racing to realise that the ownership of race horses is a very expensive activity but that without owners racing would not exist\nin britain owners recover only an average of 24 per cent of their outlay each season that compares with 47 per cent in the united states 49 per cent in\n\n\nfrance 61 per cent in south africa and 90 per cent in japan therein lies the crucial point low prize money means low returns to owners which puts vital investment in race horse ownership under threat\u2014so much so that sheikh mohammed a major race horse owner recently said that unless there were positive signs of progress and the possibility of change he would seek to reduce his racing and breeding presence in britain as he so pertinently put itmy hope and that of other owners and breeders on smaller scales is that after we have emptied our pockets we are at least allowed to keep the lining\nthe loss of such a key investor in british racing would be extremely damaging but this week the racing industry suffered shock waves from the news that sheikh mohammed is already planning to transfer the training of 100 twoyearolds to france that is bad news for employment and the industry in general and unless more money finds its way into racing such news will become epidemic we can no longer ignore the warning signs we have to address the problems in the racing industry and we have to address them now that is what the bill would begin to do\nlet me clear about one point racing asks for and needs no subsidies from government however there is much else that the government can do to help racing and i am having separate discussions with the minister about those issues one of the ways in which the government can help racing is by allowing it to help itself\ntoo much regulation for far too long has tied the hands of race courses limiting them to using their enormous assets for on average only 20 days a year\u20145 per cent of their time does any other business in the country use its buildings machinery and land for only 5 per cent of the year yet race courses are effectively limited to doing exactly that due to regulation many people ask why are race courses used so infrequently why can they not generate more of their own income well they are prevented from doing so partly by regulation\nthe bill is about removing those restrictions it is about deregulating race courses so that they can help themselves so that they can generate more of their own revenue and so that they can increase the prize money on offer thereby doing their bit to help to safeguard the future of racing in this country\nbriefly the bill seeks to allow race courses to do on nonrace days what they do on race days\u2014hardly revolutionary is it but it will help race courses to generate additional revenue for example when the grand national is being run at aintree other race courses should be able to set up large screens for people to watch the race they should be able to take tote and other bets on\n\nthe outcome of the race and run amusement and prize machines and they should be able to provide food and drink for individuals and families who attend they should be able to do all that but at the moment they cannot\ncheltenham race course for example can operate fully only if racing is taking place at cheltenham that day it cannot make maximum use of its considerable assets in the way i described on the back of racing at say aintree or during the world cup this summer my bill would enable it to do so\nmy bill is hardly a major measure it seeks to make only minor changes to current legislation but those changes will provide race courses with the potential to increase their income significantly it will also reduce unnecessary restrictions clarify the law cut bureaucracy and enable race courses to be set free to determine their own destiny\nthe regulations restricting race courses can largely be found in the betting gaming and lotteries act 1963 section 61 allows horse race courses to carry out bookmaking on nonrace days provided that bookmaking has not been carried out on that course more than seven times in the previous 12 months however given that race courses did not hold as many meetings in those days as they do now the legislation was probably drafted to enable the courses to do exactly what my bill proposes they should be able to do in other words only the passing of time and the development of race course business has caused a problem the bill aims to address that problem and in doing so to clarify and modernise the law in this respect\nthe bill will simplify the law it will thereby enable race courses to do on nonrace days what they can already do on race days it will provide race courses with the opportunity to exercise selfhelp measures and in doing so it will offer the racing industry the opportunity to increase its income significantly thereby helping to safeguard the future of britains third most popular sport\nthe bill is just one of many small measures that parliament needs to take to help the racing industry to help itself", "following the comments of the right hon member for upper bann mr trimble will the secretary of state return to the issue of sinn fein and its attitude sinn fein has had every opportunity to endorse the agreement does she agree that it is stalling in order to have time to assess how far down the road towards a united ireland the agreement will take it was not she chilled by the words of sinn feins president no sooner had he said well done david than he was commending the work of the ira and saying that it had not been defeated by the agreement", "what plans he has to meet representatives of womens groups in scotland to discuss equal opportunities 33159", "will the minister confirm that equal opportunities means people achieving posts through merit and not because of positive discrimination will he resist the temptation to create a gender balance in the scottish parliament", "what he estimates will be the cost to holders of personal equity plans to transfer them to isas 32505", "i thank the chief secretary for that illuminating reply other policyholders will be affected if costs are passed on to them the uncertainty about extra charges that may be levied if people transfer from peps to isas is preventing them from investing in peps in the first place that uncertainty is causing many problems should people invest and expect a second charge for their policies or are they expected to depend on blind trust", "will the secretary of state give way", "does my right hon friend agree that it may well have appeared that grantmaintained schools got extra money but that\n\n\nthey could spend what they needed to spend only because they were given directly money that many local education authorities had not passed on as they should have done", "i endorse everything said in this debate by my hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may and my right hon friend the member for charnwood mr dorrell i should also declare an interest as my daughter attends a grantmaintained school she is very proud to attend such a school and i am very proud that she attends one\nwe have a number of grantmaintained schools in tewkesbury and i have spent much time at them", "as they say on the television you may think that but i couldnt possibly comment nevertheless i thank my hon friend for that very kind intervention i suspect that more unfriendly interventions will be forthcoming as i make my speech\ni have spent much time at those grantmaintained schools and base my remarks not only on those visits but on my experience some years ago as a chairman of governors of a primary school that had about 200 pupils at that time primary schools of that size could not opt out they could not apply for grantmaintained status i tended to find that as chairman of governors i spent at least half my time fighting the nonsense of the socialist lea in bolton and very little time doing what i was supposed to do the headmaster found himself in a similar position\nthe lea adopted a sinister and arrogant attitude to that primary school because it knew that at that time we could do nothing about it it\u2014and other leas\u2014adopted a very different attitude to secondary schools that could opt out because of the constant threat that those schools might leave the lea i do not like to use the word threat but when dealing with socialist leas especially in the north it was necessary to use every available weapon to run a school decently\n830 pm\nthat experience persuaded me to put pressure on the then secretary of state my right hon friend the member for southwest norfolk mrs shephard to allow smaller primary schools to apply for grantmaintained status i was proud to take part in that campaign and the secretary of state authorised the change i felt that smaller primary schools needed financial and managerial autonomy the schools that have opted out have enjoyed success as a result\nthe then government wanted schools to become grant maintained because they wanted to give parents a choice about which schools their children attended there were grantmaintained schools church schools and grammar schools\u2014a range of schools\u2014so the opinion of parents the people who really take these decisions mattered\nhowever i have one criticism of the then government they made it far too difficult for schools to opt out an enormous turnout of parents in the ballot was required that requirement and the terrible campaigns that leas carried out against schools that appeared likely to opt out made it difficult for schools to opt out before any hon member says that there are not that many grantmaintained schools i should say that that is hardly surprising because there were no depths to which the leas would not sink to prevent schools from opting out that is why there are not as many as there should have been", "my hon friend is right those schools do not know what will happen and they are afraid of being returned to that situation some disgraceful campaigns were mounted against schools that proposed to opt out\ni attended st jamess school in farnworth bolton which i believe became the second school in the country to opt out it was interesting to watch how the lea acted\n\n\nto try to prevent the school from doing so it let it be known that the school might close that made parents slightly dubious about sending their children to the school so the rolls started falling and the lea then considered closing the school the bolton lea thereby put the school in a position where it had no option but to opt out the campaign that the lea waged against the school was disgraceful my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west mr brady is absolutely right\nthe previous government should have made it easier for schools to opt out especially given the success that grantmaintained schools have had i ask a single question those schools\u2014", "i can only quote the figures that i have been given laughter well i shall not quote the figures that the minister gave me because when i did so this morning having had them in writing from the minister he denied that he had given them to me\u2014so i shall not quote the governments figures because i may be corrected they may change later this evening\nhowever i understand that 92 per cent of grantmaintained schools have appointed additional staff 91 per cent have increased their spending on books and equipment and 54 per cent have increased their spending on new buildings interruption from a sedentary position the hon member for bath mr foster suggests that i am talking only about cash i am actually talking about what that cash bought which seems to me to be quite important", "as usual my hon friend makes the point better than i could\nif now that optedout schools are about to lose their status i were to ask them would you by choice revert to your previous status under the lea i am not aware that any school would choose to do so we should listen to what those schools are saying it is all very well for us to talk about the subject in the chamber should we not listen to what the schools are saying they opted out\n\nvoluntarily and they would not revert to their previous status they have had success because they have been able to control their finances they have more teachers books and buildings\ngrantmaintained schools have also been a success in less tangible terms when one walks through a grantmaintained school one can feel its liveliness balanced by discipline i believe that that is unique in such schools", "i am grateful for that intervention the prime minister is absolutely right to exercise his choice about which school he sends his children to\u2014i wish them the best of success\u2014but he is wrong to deny that choice to other children of course he is only following what many other labour ministers have done they have attended schools that at a later date they have wanted to close it is a matter of do as they say and not as they have done they have benefited from a far greater education than many conservative members have done but have then wanted to close those very schools it is hypocrisy i am sorry that that is the case\ni spoke of the success that resulted from financial and managerial autonomy i spoke of the intangible success of a disciplined and lively atmosphere in grantmaintained schools that has led to the academic success that conservative members have mentioned", "having spent 33 years in lancashire i do not recognise the success that the hon lady describes i am not suggesting that there is no discipline in schools that are not grant maintained i am saying that the grantmaintained schools that i have experience of have successfully balanced a great fun atmosphere with good discipline if the hon lady is suggesting that there has not been a discipline problem in our schools she has\n\n\nlived in a different country from me there have been serious discipline problems at many schools in lancashire\nthe financial autonomy managerial autonomy and intangible atmosphere of grantmaintained schools have led to great academic success that success is clear for all to see it is a tragedy that the government want to scrap those schools\nwhat will happen to grantmaintained schools when they return to lea control like other schools they will have to queue up for money from leas that is difficult for many schools many councils have a lot of bureaucracy and topslice the money diverting it from schools i pointed out to the secretary of state at education and employment questions a few weeks ago that the labour group in gloucestershire did not want to passport the governments extra money to schools that money is being passported only thanks to the conservative group with the support of the liberal democrat group the labour group voted against it", "absolutely disgraceful\nif something is not broken we ought not to be fixing it as my hon friend the member for maidenhead asked why are the government making the changes it is another vain attempt to look dynamic if there had been no grantmaintained status the government would probably have introduced it just to look as though they were doing something their behaviour is spiteful many labour members still consider good education to be an elitist concept i did not have the education that i might have wanted but i respect those who did and i respect organisations that provide good education it is a pity that the government do not their socialist principles are in good health and are here for all to see", "i am happy to correct the secretary of state i am not proud of the fact but i had the distinction of failing the 11 plus i went to a good secondary modern school and did not go to a grammar school until i was 16", "rose\u2014", "i am grateful to the minister who has been generous in giving way i was quoting from the written answer that he gave me", "i congratulate my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west mr brady on the way in which he introduced the debate he put his finger on a complicated matter which has a great effect across the country particularly in councils such as trafford and tewkesbury i thank my hon friend for bringing the issue to the attention of the house\nthe information that i shall use in my brief contribution was provided by the undersecretary of state the hon member for greenwich and woolwich mr raynsford a short time ago by way of a written answer i am grateful for his assistance when i examined the settlement in tewkesbury i found that the council faces a 51 per cent reduction in its standard spending assessment i found that quite odd so i examined the situation more closely\u2014the minister was kind enough to provide the details\u2014and i discovered that if national totals had been taken into account tewkesbury would have received an increase of 08 per cent if demographic changes in tewkesbury had been taken into account it would have had an increase of a further 06 per cent however the method of distribution would have meant a loss of 65 per cent\nbecause of the changes the net reduction in tewkesbury is 51 per cent i am told that changes in the composition of the indices in the all other services block and changes in the treatment of debt are responsible for that that seems rather unfair tewkesbury does not have any debt and that seems to have cost it dearly my office contacted tewkesburys finance section yesterday which\n\n\nagreed that the settlement was unfair the council said that it might not have paid off its debts if it had known that the new system would be introduced i am sure that many councils will be encouraged to take on more debt in the knowledge that the government will bail them out the government seem to have created a rather odd system that will encourage debt which must lead to a reduction in council services throughout the country", "i will certainly not join the hon gentleman in condemning any council i am not making that point and i do not have the knowledge to speak about wandsworth although i understand that it has held a responsible level of council tax community charge or rates for many years\nif a council increases its debt the voters in the area should unfortunately have to pay for it until the next opportunity to kick out that council i do not see why people in tewkesbury which has incurred no debt should have their grant reduced simply to pay for the sort of councils that my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west discussed", "the hon lady may recall that i asked a question of the secretary of state for education and employment about gloucestershire county council mistakenly the right hon gentleman assumed that it was under conservative control and condemned it for its nursery policy in fact for many years it was controlled by the liberal democrats so he got that wrong he also got another aspect wrong as the labour group on the council has tried to deny passported money going to schools and it is going to the schools only because of the conservative group on the council therefore perhaps the hon lady ought to look a little more closely at the matter than the secretary of state did on that occasion\nto return to the reply that the undersecretary was kind enough to give me it seems that the reduction in total of revenue support grant and redistributed nondomestic rates in tewkesbury exceeds the reduction in the ssa the hon gentleman informed me that that follows changes to the ssa system and crucially\u2014this will come across to council tax payers in the near future\u2014one of the causes of the change has been a shift in the cost of local authority services from central government to council tax payers with the new change it seems that the cost has been shifted only to certain council tax payers\u2014in other\n\nwords those in prudent authorities and not those who live in the sort of authorities that my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west so eloquently described", "will the leader of the house ask the minister for school standards the hon member for tyneside north mr byers to clarify his statement that any threats of closure to a village school will be called in for a decision\n\nhis statement has caused confusion throughout the country councils do not know whether it is a further example of the governments determination to centralise power or just an empty gesture to the countryside movement", "i have the honour of presenting a petition from the members of the general synod of the church of england the human rights bill requires that churches and other religious bodies be treated as public authorities when they perform public functions such as the conducting of marriages and the running of church schools as the petition makes clear because public authorities can be sued under the legislation for breaching the european convention churches and other religious bodies will be open to be sued in the secular courts on theological and moral issues\nthe petition argues that religious bodies should be free to arrange their internal affairs and organise their church schools and religious charities in accordance with existing arrangements it also argues that the house should retain the amendments passed in another place which would help to prevent religious bodies from being successfully sued in the secular courts\nthe petition has been signed by 141 members of the general synod which is a quarter of the total membership it includes the signatures of philip gore\u2014a prominent lay member\u2014and the bishops of manchester hull and rochester i am also authorised by the office of the archbishop of canterbury to say that he is concerned to ensure that the legislation cannot be used to require the church to act in ways contrary to its religious principles and beliefs there is also a great deal of concern about the issue among ordinary church members their fear is that british courts could develop the law in a way that may restrict religious liberties\nthe petition ends\nwherefore your petitioners pray that your honourable house will support the human rights bill as amended in the house of lords thus allowing a proper defence for religious bodies who could be pursued in the secular courts over what are essentially theological and moral issues", "we have all seen the expensive television advertisements about the\n\nnew deal but i am concerned about the silent majority whose voice is not heard may we have a debate on the impact of the windfall tax on people who work in the utilities and who may lose their jobs because of the utilities inability to invest the money that they would otherwise have invested and because the utilities will no longer be able to peg their prices i raise that matter following the point made by my right hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst mr forth about some hon members not being able to obtain proper answers from ministers via the table office", "rose", "i remind the minister that i described the arts council as an august body i was suggesting that the measures contained in the amendments would add weight to those bodies and take nothing from them", "i am not sure that i can follow the comments of my hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings mr hayes\u2014certainly not about rugby i must endorse what my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale mr collins has said i find the drafting of schedule 13 odd for a number of reasons not least because i have looked at similar legislation dealing with audit\nmy understanding is that the government are looking to extend the scope of auditing it seems odd to me that the arts council of wales and the sports council for\n\nwales should not be included given the nature of those august bodies it would be helpful to those bodies if they were subject to full audit because their awards are the subject of controversy\u2014not from an audit point of view but from the point of view of those who do not receive awards i am sure that many hon members are aware of the controversy surrounding the awards it would be in the interests of those bodies if they fell within the schedule for that reason the minister should look at the schedule from the point of view of those bodies", "i support what my hon friend the member for woodspring dr fox said about the possibility of the treasurys changing the rules so that the scottish parliament could levy a higher taxation rate than 3p in the pound my hon friend has covered that point but it is extremely important as regards democracy", "the scottish people were asked to vote on whether they wanted the scottish parliament to have taxvarying powers they understood that the rate would be no more than 3p in the pound but it could well be more than that\ni refer to the constraints that might be placed on the treasury the chancellor of the exchequer has said\u2014i believe very reasonably\u2014that he might want to introduce a taxation rate of 10p in the pound what effect will that have on the scottish parliaments ability to raise \u00a3450 million will it not place the most enormous constraints on the treasurys ability to act for the whole united kingdom i ask the minister to reply to those two points", "i am sure that my hon friend will agree that \u00a32 million spent in establishing a potentially enormously expensive body pales into insignificance compared with possible future sums", "i am surprised that i have heard talk about 18 years of tory misrule wales has received a disproportionate amount of inward investment given its population the labour party should take note of a former chancellor who described the state of the economy as the best in a generation labour has inherited that my hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings mr hayes correctly pointed out that the labour government decided to stick to the conservative spending limits they were not forced to do so\nin the brief time available to me i should like to draw attention to one or two points people in wales face massive council tax increases my hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings pointed out several areas that will have high increases rather than going over the many factors behind that i should like to point out some future costs the welsh assembly may have added costs it will be able to reduce the amount of money that it gives to local authorities in wales and could give that money to other bodies such as the welsh development agency it could also introduce a taxraising power through the back door by deliberately holding funds back from local authorities forcing council taxes up\nbusinesses in wales will also face a threat responsibility for the calculation of the national nondomestic rate will pass to the assembly after devolution it will also be able to decide how much money local authorities can borrow there is no guarantee that the assembly will not cut funding for councils forcing them to incur even more debt\nhon members on both sides have said that the settlement is inadequate as my hon friends have pointed out it leads to massive increases in council tax for many people if that is not bad enough there could be worse to come", "it seems curious that my hon friends the members for new forest west mr swayne and for north shropshire mr paterson always seem to attract derision for constantly hitting the nail on the head i shall not rehearse the points that they made\nwhen the scottish people were given devolution i think that they expected to be given democracy i ask the secretary of state to address this point how on earth can the scottish people have democracy if one person has the right to overturn legislation how does that sit with the principles of democracy", "i endorse the amendments tabled by my right hon and hon friends having sat through many hours of debate on the government of wales bill and the scotland bill i am worried about disputes because both bills have the potential to create a great many disputes that is one reason why i support amendment no 280 which gives guidance on how some disputes might be resolved\namendment no 279 concerns potential disputes or at least confusion so i support what my hon friend the member for northeast hertfordshire mr heald said about clarifying the bill we must make it plain that nothing in the bill permits scottish ministers to exercise any functions\u2104or enjoy any power if that word is preferable\u2104in any part of the united kingdom other than scotland that helps to clarify the bill", "i am grateful for that intervention which gives me the opportunity to say that although what the hon gentleman says may be true in relation to the scottish people we in westminster still face the prospect of scottish members coming down here and voting on purely english matters while we cannot vote on scottish matters so the potential for disputes still exists i accept that the scottish people have no selfish interest in matters outside scotland but the amendment attempts to clarify\n\n\nthe matter if the hon gentleman says that there is no potential for problems why should the clarification not be included in the bill", "i thank my right hon friend for that intervention some issues may come under the jurisdiction of scotland or england i suggest that they should come under the jurisdiction of the crown that would be the best way to proceed\ni also endorse what my hon friend the member for northeast hertfordshire said about enterprise zones the statistics for scotland are indeed impressive if we are to engage in the new spirit of cooperation\u2104in which the minister seems to be willing to engage albeit to a limited extent\u2104we want the best for scotland i admit that the conservative party does not want a scottish parliament in the first place but we do want what is best for scotland amendment no 310 deals with that issue like wales scotland has attracted a disproportionate amount of inward investment in relation to its population and we want that to continue for the purpose of creating more jobs and more wealth", "i should like to make one or two brief points in support of what my hon friend has said in my constituency\u2014", "i apologise i have not spoken to the minister about it", "thank you mr deputy speaker i apologise to you and to the house\ni have been visited more than once by farmers in my area who have shown me photographic evidence of attacks on farm animals which i do not believe could have been carried out by anything other than big cats lambs with their heads ripped completely off and fang marks of a width that no dog could produce are part of the evidence one of the problems that farmers in my area have\u2014", "i shall end by saying that it seems that the problem\u2014this may well be the case in midnorfolk \u2014is that people are reluctant to seek publicity because of stories such as those about the beast of bodmin", "my hon friend says that under the new system members of parliament could be falling over each other to help constituents but surely it could work the other way they could easily pass the buck", "it is a pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for poole mr syms who has studied proportional representation a great deal i listened closely to what he had to say\na few days ago i caused some hilarity when speaking on the government of wales bill i described a number of systems being introduced as somewhat alien to the british constitution and the british people that is basically why i object to much of the bill it introduces devolved government and more than one parliament into one united kingdom in addition to stick to the point it introduces another voting system which has not been experienced by the british people it has been experienced to some extent in northern ireland but not in britain it is a mixed system to which i object because it will lead to confusion\ni want to speak briefly against the proportional representation system of voting because it is an undemocratic system as my hon friend the member for northeast hertfordshire mr heald said it leads to government by secret deals in a pr system it is not the electorate who decide the government a few minutes ago the committee was asked whether it was fair for a party that gets 40 per cent of the vote to form the government\u2014and a case could be made that that is not fair but i would stress that it is far fairer than a party which gets 5 per cent of the vote deciding who forms the government and under a pr system such a party can indeed take that decision the present system is not perfect but it is the best one available\npr might lead to a direct ratio between the proportion of votes and the number of seats that a party has but that is only fair if one looks at the whole area in individual constituencies it is fair that the candidate who gets the highest number of votes should represent that constituency it is worth reminding ourselves that it is individual constituencies that form the constitution of this country so not only are two parliaments in one country somewhat inconsistent with the constitution and a major change to it but a change in the voting system to a pr system is too some hon members might prefer that but many do not", "does the hon gentleman agree with my assertion that the devolution bills that are\n\nbeing pushed through are part of the plan to create a federal europe of regions does he think that the united kingdom should go that way", "the hon gentleman speaks about devolution bringing harmony to the people of these islands surely it will create uncertainty among some people depending on where they live the devolution bills will mean that we will no longer be equal citizens", "will the hon gentleman give way", "is there not a contradiction as i understand it ministers will retain responsibility for ensuring that european legislation is implemented as my hon friend the member for new forest west mr swayne said agriculture is by and large controlled from europe but we are handing agriculture to the assembly is not that contradictory", "will the hon gentleman give way", "to get 20 per cent of the vote and yet no seats is wrong only if one looks at the whole area of wales but if we look at each constituency\u2014the principle on which the constitution of this country is rightly founded\u2014we see that in each case electors chose to vote for another candidate surely that is quite acceptable to everybody", "i agree with some of the remarks by the hon members for swansea east mr anderson and for montgomeryshire mr \u00f6pik they stressed the importance of the link between the member and the constituency not just because it tends to give people what they want but because it is representative of the british constitutional and electoral systems\ni shall make one or two brief comments i make no apology for repeating myself as one of my concerns about devolution and the constitution of the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly is the drift\u2014although it is somewhat driven\u2014towards european politics\nthe chancellor of the exchequer has said that there is no constitutional bar to britain joining a single currency the united kingdom is being broken up into regions\n\n\nproportional representation is also an alien concept my right hon friend the member for devizes mr ancram spoke about its dangers", "i am not sure whether i should welcome that intervention but i feel that proportional representation and devolution are totally alien to british political life\nthe concept of political parties having to register or be part of the constitution is also totally alien as is the fact that people will be asked to vote for a political party rather than a person even though they support that political party the fact that members will serve those who compile a list rather than the people whom they are supposed to represent is another element of an alien system the fact that there will be gatherings of groups to keep the whole thing going is also alien to the british way of life\ni am perplexed that so many hon members are smiling or laughing at what i am saying it may be somewhat comical but i challenge them to point out where i am wrong in saying that the system is alien to the british way of life it is not what people in this country expect or what they have grown up with i agree with the right hon member for llanelli mr davies who said that the issue will come back to haunt his party i ask the government to take note of him and many others from various parties who although i do not agree with everything that they have said have already come up with many objections to the system", "what is the number of nhs beds per head of population in scotland and what assessment he has made of the per capita provision of nhs beds in scotland relative to the united kingdom average 21719", "i am grateful to the minister for that answer does he accept that that favourable percentage is due to the financial arrangements that scotland has had in the united kingdom will those arrangements be sustainable when scotland has its own parliament", "i am privileged to be introducing an adjournment debate on the national hunt racing industry basically i want to do three things first i wish to draw attention to the importance of the racing industry to the country and to my constituency secondly i wish to highlight some of the problems that in particular national hunt racing faces thirdly i wish to suggest one or two ways forward in which the government might help\nfirst i declare an interest the cheltenham race course is in my constituency and i am a member of that course although i am sure that membership of it costs more money than it brings in i declare also a passion for racing especially national hunt racing most people in this country and many others throughout the world are stirred by the excitement of the grand national and the cheltenham gold cup and by many other races that we stage in britain\ntwo million people attended race meetings last year to enjoy the spectacle of racing it is the third most popular sport in the country racing is a large industry with a turnover of \u00a3600 million a year the turnover is more than \u00a35 billion a year if betting is included in the calculations the industrys assets total more than \u00a32 billion and it is responsible for \u00a390 millionworth of exports a year it also contributes \u00a3600 million a year to the exchequer which is a subject to which i shall return shortly\nthe industry generates jobs for more than 100000 people it is responsible for providing jobs for one in every eight agricultural workers there are 500 racing training yards in britain and 50 race courses of which 44 stage national hunt racing at present more than 12000 horses are in training\nin my constituency alone cheltenham race course has a turnover of \u00a310 million a year that does not include the massive revenue that is generated in hotels guest houses pubs and restaurants by the 173000 people who attend the threeday national hunt festival in march each year\nit might be asked if the industry is doing so well why introduce an adjournment debate on it sadly racing\u2014especially the national hunt side\u2014has its problems no one is suggesting that these problems point to a terminal decline but i want to bring the problems to the governments attention because largely they are caused by the way in which successive governments have regulated the industry\nthe house will be aware that only yesterday lord wakeham resigned as chairman of the british horseracing board and that that body has been discussing this morning a financial plan which has been compiled to address the problems of the racing industry generally\nwhat are the problems facing the industry they are of course financial the prize money won by guiding a horse to victory in the grand national or the cheltenham gold cup is well worth having however the prize money received by winning a race at fontwell or newton abbot for example can be as low as \u00a31300 out of which the winning owner would have to pay a percentage to the trainer and the jockey as well as his own travelling expenses for that day\nwhen we consider that on average it costs \u00a310000 a year to have a national hunt horse in training it does not require a degree in mathematics to work out that involvement in racing costs most owners dearly on average owners in britain recover only 24 per cent of their costs each season that compares with 47 per cent in the united states 49 per cent in france 61 per cent in south africa and 90 per cent in japan of the nine major racing nations british owners come eighth in the league with only owners in ireland being worse off it is no coincidence that ireland is the only other country to have a major national hunt programme\nthe poor return to owners has a knockon effect it means that fewer horses are in training than would otherwise be the case given the low prize money 32 per cent of races attract fewer than eight runners that in turn means that fewer bets are placed on those races because eachway betting is not an option as a result less money is collected in taxation by the government more important less money is collected by the horserace betting levy board to return to racing if less money is returned to racing prize money will remain low at that point the circle begins again\nit is crucial to the industry that smaller courses thrive the analogy that i would draw is that the football league would not survive if it contained only the big clubs such as manchester united and liverpool those clubs depend on the smaller clubs such as doncaster rovers or brentford to supply players many players start from such clubs the same goes for racing most horses trainers and owners start from what might be called the feeder tracks before progressing if they ever do to cheltenham and aintree\nit is vital that attention is given to the problems that are faced by the smaller race courses to enable them to increase the prize money on offer thereby protecting the fundamental base of the industry\nwhy is the prize money so low the answer is that not enough money comes into racing from the most obvious source of revenue the betting industry the punters cannot be blamed for that because they cheerfully or otherwise contribute about \u00a31 billion a year to the bookies in lost bets the bookies survive on a profit margin of less than 3 per cent the problem is the low percentage of betting turnover that finds its way back into racing\nfor every bet placed the punter pays tax at 9 per cent of the total bet\u2014the bet plus the tax\u2014the money is distributed as follows 78 per cent is returned to the punter as winnings which is average by international standards and overheads of 14 per cent are retained by the betting industry whereas the international level is about half that amount the percentage is high in britain because of the regulated nature of such betting the 14 per cent for overheads includes profits for bookmakers of only 235 per cent compared with an international spread of between 4 and 8 per cent\nthe betting duty taken by the government is 675 per cent which leaves only 119 per cent of the total bet to go back into racing that is the crux of the problem that percentage compares with 8 per cent in france 9 per cent in the united states and 15 per cent in germany it is no wonder that prize money is so low in britain\nthe ratio of how much the government take to how much racing receives is 61 in britain in france it is 181 and in germany it is 0051 these ratios clearly demonstrate that the government are taking too high a percentage of the tax paid by the punter when compared to the amount that racing receives from the tax\nthe minister will be aware that the tax percentage taken by the government of 675 per cent is not particularly high by international standards and is at about the middle of the range nevertheless government is racings problem in this country in a number of ways although some foreign governments might charge a comparable rate of tax the overheads of the racing industry abroad are lower than in this country the reason is the overregulation of much of the industry\nfor example race courses in this country are restricted in the activities that they can pursue betting on horse races can take place only in licensed betting shops all this regulation adds to the cost of running the betting industry which is why overheads are so high\ni have dealt with the problems but what are the solutions much in common with what the british horseracing board is suggesting today i have some proposals which if taken up would serve to protect the racing industry and enable it to remain a major employer a popular sport and a big money spinner well into the next century\nthe real way forward for racing is to deregulate much of the industry at present racing gets much of its money\u2014about \u00a354 million a year\u2014from the levy board and that arrangement is regulated by the government because of the present arrangement negotiated at government level racing stands to lose \u00a35 million a year from this source for the next two years in time the racing industry needs to be able to negotiate the levy arrangements directly with the bookmakers so that a faminetoworsefamine situation can be avoided\nthe betting industry also needs deregulating to a large extent why cannot bets on horse races be made in the same places at which lottery tickets are bought in common with what happens in other countries that would cut the industrys overheads thereby leaving more room for negotiation between the racing industry and the bookmakers race courses too should be deregulated to allow them to realise the true worth of their assets\nwithout being controversial i believe that the government should not cause further problems for the national hunt industry by accommodating legislation that would cause hunting to be banned as such a move would be very damaging to the industry\u2014a point widely acknowledged in racing circles\nthese solutions are for the future the industry needs an immediate increase in income of \u00a3105 million a year to increase prize money significantly improve its marketing and thereby safeguard the future of the industry and the livelihoods of those who work in it\nthe british horseracing board has identified ways in which the industry could raise an additional \u00a325 million a year but that leaves \u00a380 million a year which must come from the betting industry given that bookmakers make less than 3 per cent in profits it is incumbent on the government to change the present betting dutybetting levy ratio about which i spoke earlier the ratio is currently 61 if it were changed to one similar to that of france say to 171 the racing industry would have the\n\n\nmoney that it needed enabling it to double the prize money which would give the industry a tremendous boost and the money would find its way into the pockets of trainers and stablehands as well as owners\nsuch a transformation in the fortunes of the racing industry can be attained simply by the government cutting betting duty from 675 to 5 per cent with the difference going to the levy board for distribution to racing it is estimated that that would cost the government only about \u00a3125 million a year initially but that money would be regained in the short to medium term through extra tax receipts which would be taken from a regenerated racing industry in the longer term the governments tax take from the industry would probably increase just as the previous government increased their tax take by cutting the rates of tax\nwithout wanting to be party political i should point out that the previous government helped the industry by cutting betting tax by abolishing oncourse betting tax altogether and by allowing owners to claim back vat on training fees and bloodstock purchases it is time for the government to recognise the problems that the industry faces and to realise that government is the largest part of the problem", "my hon friend is absolutely right when somebody of that gentlemans standing is persuaded to consider withdrawing his horses from british racing that is a very dire warning of which we should all take notice his racehorses tend to be flatrace horses and flat racing is better funded than national hunt racing if he sees such a problem in flat racing the problem in national hunt racing is indeed worse\ni ask the government to recognise that government in general has tended to be the problem in the racing industry i should like them to consider how they might offer help to the industry i stress that no one in racing is asking for a government handout or subsidy all we ask is that the government stop taking such a large amount of money out of racing especially when they treat other forms of gambling more leniently\na cut in betting duty and a transfer of that to the levy board\u2014a move seen as vital by the industry\u2014would enable racing to continue to provide employment to thousands of people and enjoyment to millions i ask the government seriously to consider making such a mediumterm investment in an industry which is one of the hallmarks of britain", "i am pleased to follow the hon member for dundee east mr mcallion because when i made my maiden speech on the referendums scotland and wales bill he followed me and was extremely kind\ni wanted to speak in the debate because i care very much what happens to scotland i have visited and stayed in scotland many times and spent a great deal of time working there indeed i honeymooned on the isle of arran so i am well aware of the wonderful backdrop that scotland provides to some delightful activities\ni realise that a number of hon members who represent scottish seats feel that those who represent english seats should have no say in the issue as i have said before in\n\n\nthe house scottish devolution is a matter not merely for scotland but for the whole of the united kingdom of which we are all citizens therefore scottish devolution is not merely the preserve of hon members representing scottish seats it is of fundamental and constitutional interest to all of us\nenglish members have not only a right but a duty to speak out on the issue in fact it is incumbent on us to do so not only to preserve the union but to preserve the united kingdoms position as an independent selfgoverning nation state there cannot be any doubt what is in the governments mind it is the breaking up of the united kingdom and bad though that is in itself it is only part of a strategy that involves submerging this country in a federal europe we have scottish devolution and welsh devolution we do not yet know what is coming for northern ireland an assembly has been proposed for london and regional government for england that all seems to be part of a plan to break the united kingdom down into regions with the intention of submerging each of those into a federal europe\neuropean federalism and the breaking up of the united kingdom are the reverse of what people in this country want not many people mentioned scottish devolution to me during the general election campaign but since the referendum many constituents have done so both on the doorstep and through the post people in england are concerned about devolution because they see as i do that it could well usher in the breakup of the united kingdom many of us would agree with that analysis\ncuriously although scottish office ministers say that devolution will hold the united kingdom together in some way the scottish national party claims the opposite\u2014that it is the first step towards full independence for scotland both views cannot be right and having read the bill carefully i tend to agree with the scottish national partys opinion which is also held by many of my constituents who realise that full independence for scotland will be the natural consequence of the bill and of devolution that may well please the snp but it is anathema to so many people who believe in the integrity of the united kingdom\ni unashamedly stand by the union because i want scotland to be part of the kingdom in which i live not because i want to impose some supposed english power on the people of scotland but because i have a genuine affection for scotland i hope that the scottish nationalists will take that as it is intended which is sincerely\ni should have preferred the scottish people to be asked to vote on such a constitutional matter part way through a parliament when the popularity of the government and the result of the recent general election were not telling factors\u2014i accept the popularity of the labour government\u2014because it is an issue which is important enough to be discussed independently over a period of time", "the people in scotland debated it in 1979 and came up with a different verdict\nthe government were successful in the referendum in september as my frontbench colleagues have said however much we dislike that decision and may fear its consequences and feel that the scottish people were persuasively manipulated we have to accept the result of a democratic referendum but that does not mean that we should not point out the flaws weaknesses and inherent dangers that we perceive in the bill\nas well as introducing a second parliament in one nation which is likely in itself to give rise to conflict the bill introduces a voting system that is completely peculiar in britain not only will members be elected to the scottish parliament by proportional representation which is in itself a totally flawed and undemocratic system but there will be two systems in operation at the same time and two tiers of elected representatives those with constituencies and those without those who serve their constituents and those who serve those who compile the pr lists those who will receive letters from their constituents on important matters and those who will not those who will be replaced by electoral means if they choose to leave the parliament early and those who will simply be replaced\nat the moment it may be especially important to my party to have such a system because as has been said we may win seats that we would not otherwise have won but that is far too weak and unconstitutional an argument to persuade me to support the proposals on the contrary we in the conservative party are concerned about creating correct lasting constitutional arrangements to serve everyone in the united kingdom equally and fairly\ni should love to say much more but we are constrained by time time i am afraid will deny the house the wisdom of what else i had to say my concern and my priority is to ensure the survival of the union of the united kingdom and the continuation of the united kingdom as an independent nation state", "no parliament can bind its successors if what the hon gentleman has suggested is inserted in the clause will he also insert a statement that 44 per cent of the people of scotland voted for the parliament and 38 per cent voted for the taxvarying powers the hon gentleman mentioned the people of scotland\u2014those are the figures", "what is his departments policy towards the maintenance of bridges and trunk roads and if he will make a statement 19426", "i remind the minister that it is extremely important to maintain bridges i understand that\n\ngloucestershire is bidding for help to strengthen its bridges and that failure to provide such help will lead to the imposition of weight restrictions and great disruption not only around those areas but to the local economies will the right hon gentleman take that into account", "following the question asked by the hon member for moray mrs ewing may i urge that we have a full debate on the agriculture industry and on the beef situation in particular i would not expect the right hon lady to be aware of this but last night 400 farmers descended on a meat distribution depot in my constituency they stopped lorries going this way and that and are planning further disruptions i am sure that no one wants to see such action but on the other hand many people are very sympathetic to the farmers case especially as we have a beef export ban and further bans on meat but no guarantee whatever of the quality and safety of meat coming from abroad", "what steps he is taking to ensure that the extra money allocated by the government to local authorities is actually allocated to schools budgets 18754", "i thank the right hon gentleman for that reply i remind him that there is a difference between schools and education as he has written to all local authorities why did the labour group on gloucestershire county council vote just two weeks ago not to pass all the money on to schools it was only because of the conservative group that the motion to do so was carried", "is the prime minister aware of the enormous number of representations that i and other hon members have received from councils charities companies and individuals regarding the removal of advance corporation tax credit does he accept that devastating though his raid on pension funds will be his government would have been subject to far less opposition if he had at least been honest about his intentions before the election", "when the minister discusses employment opportunities in the countryside will he bear in mind the enormous impact a hunting ban would have on countryside employment", "it is a privilege to follow the hon member for vale of glamorgan mr smith especially as i come from the wrong side of the severn as he would describe it i am not welsh and do not represent a welsh constituency although i am not that far off but i wanted to take part in this debate to do my bit\u2014it is only my bit\u2014to try to preserve the united kingdom and to protect it from sliding towards the great danger of becoming a set of regions within a federal europe\nby and large i object to the bill for two main and broad reasons\u2014first because of some of the details and secondly because i object to the general principles of devolution as they are being applied\non the details the introduction of a new voting system on the back of devolution concerns me two new things are coming in at once such voting systems have not been explained to or endorsed by the electorate that form of proportional representation is alien to britain under our constitution voters vote for people and not for parties it could be said that they vote conservative labour or occasionally liberal democrat but by and large under our constitution they vote for people also parties have not previously had to register under the bill they will have to\nobviously that represents a significant and confusing shift in the way we elect the people who run our country we are moving not to one simple system of proportional representation\u2014if there is such a thing\u2014but to a dual system with all the confusion that that will bring the welsh assembly will have a twotier membership some members will have constituents and some will not some will have constituencies and some will not some will receive many letters and have much work to do each week but some will not some will be in touch with the electorate and some will not and some will be serving their constituents while others will serve those who compile the lists i do not want that system to be introduced into this country\nsuch a dual system might benefit the conservative party at the moment we might win some seats that we would not otherwise win but the principle is the important thing in this bill the principle is confusing and very wrong\nthe assembly itself is also a matter of some confusion the bill does not make it clear whether it will be powerful or weak for example the secretary of state will be able to overrule the assembly direct it and revoke its decisions does that make this new assembly nothing more than an expensive talking shop or will it be concerned with the government of wales will it be a powerful body which is it the bill certainly does not make that clear\nwe have heard much comment on the referendum as my hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans pointed out the turnout for the referendum was somewhat less than when one was held in 1978 then 583 per cent of the electorate voted this time it was 501 per cent\nthe bill is being rushed through the referendum was rushed through while it is fair to say that the labour government were enjoying a fair degree of popularity it was rushed through before the bill was published and there was a small turnout even given all that only a tiny majority was in favour of the bill\nis that a full mandate\u2014a mandate sufficiently strong to break up the united kingdom is it a mandate sufficiently strong to move the united kingdom towards the labour governments real aim which is a europe of regions if another referendum were held in 12 months say it could well give a different result it is safe to assume that by then the gloss will have gone off the labour government the bill is now published and by then we will have debated it in full and that referendum would not be influenced by the scottish vote", "the united states is a completely different country some areas of the united states experience many problems that i would not want us to experience it is not comparable\nif another referendum on the issue were held when circumstances were different\u2014even in 12 months time\u2014the outcome would be very different especially given the closeness of the vote at a time when the government had everything on their side\nas we have heard from opposition members in most countries major constitutional change requires a minimum mandate\u2014a threshold when the previous referendum was held the labour government required such a threshold if they had not scotland would have had its own parliament then the fact that it was not given a parliament then caused certain members to bring down that labour government perhaps that is what concerns this government\u2014not that they are likely to be brought down in the house but that they are conscious of the fact that they need to win the next election and that may be worrying them very much\nvirtually every club society and association in the land has to achieve a twothirds vote at a special meeting to change its constitution if that is good enough for them and for many other countries why is it not good enough\n\n\nfor devolution votes in this country especially as the bill is i understand to be considered in standing committee not on the floor of the house", "the conservative government were elected by the legitimate electoral means as indeed were the present labour government who achieved about 45 per cent of the vote and are moving towards breaking up the united kingdom and taking us headlong into a federal europe do they intend to consult the electorate on that i very much doubt it", "i thank the hon gentleman for that history lesson and bow to his great authority in the matter as the united kingdom is being broken up without any consultation of the english people there should be some certainty before the labour government proceed down the road that they have chosen\nas i was saying i regret the fact that the bill will not be considered in committee of the whole house that prevents many hon members from taking part including many labour members who may be critical of the governments plans perhaps that is part of the labour plan silence the critics ride roughshod over the house of commons and introduce referendums before legislation\nthat is no way to go about breaking up the united kingdom which as far as i can see is what this is all about we are to have a scottish parliament and a welsh assembly and regional government in england if that is not about fracturing the united kingdom i do not know what is i do not believe that the measures can strengthen the union they can only weaken it\ni recognise some of the problems under the union but i believe that wales and scotland have done well and that their future cannot be guaranteed under the proposals as my hon friend the member for ribble valley said wales received \u00a34352 per head to englands \u00a33743 if we go down the devolution road that difference could give rise to english nationalism which i would regret\nthere could be a demand to reduce that allocation and the welsh representation in parliament there could also be\u2014indeed there is\u2014a demand for an english parliament some of those demands are acceptable and understandable but i do not want a rise in english nationalism i do not want\n\nthere to be an english parliament first because i am elected to represent constituents in the united kingdom parliament and secondly because i am against devolution\ni see no reason to prevent decisions from being made on a more local basis\u2014for example i am all in favour of strengthening the role of councils in northern ireland\u2014but i see no need for bodies to be set up that create a potential for conflict two parliaments and one assembly in one country must give rise to conflict as well as to duplication and confusion not only constitutionally in government circles but in the minds of the electorate\nwhom will the electorate blame if things go wrong or credit if they go right whom will they contact\u2014their constituency member of parliament their constituency member of the welsh assembly or their regional member of the welsh assembly what on earth will they do will they not experience some gridlock if the welsh assembly or indeed the scottish parliament is of a different political persuasion from the house of commons\ni am concerned about the labour governments master plan\u2014if such it be\u2014to create a federal europe of regions do they really plan the end of the nation state in europe we have already had scottish and welsh devolution we are to have a greater london authority and proposals are already being drawn up for english regional government\nsome might accuse me of alarmism but when i hear the chancellor of the exchequer saying that there is no constitutional bar to a single currency i am greatly concerned and i want to alert the public to what is going on because i really believe that the united kingdom is being broken up into small regions and that each of those regions will form part of a federal europe the british electorate have never consented to that and would never do so this is a slippery slope to something that the people of this country simply do not want\nit is often suggested that the conservative party should not engage in this debate as we have no representation in wales as if that meant that we had no interest in wales this debate is not about wales but about the united kingdom not only are we entitled to take part in such debates it is incumbent on us to do so and to speak out against the bill so that we may preserve the union and the united kingdom and resist moves towards a federal europe of regions", "in view of the hon gentlemans remarks about the conservatives lack of representation in wales and scotland and our ability to be the party of the union in those areas is he saying that the labour party is the party of the union in northern ireland if so which party in northern ireland represents its views most closely", "does my hon friend accept that the phrase first past the post is an inadequate way of describing that voting system\n\n\nits great benefit is that it links the representative to the constituency and to the constituents to whom he should report", "what discussions he has had with the insurance industry concerning the introduction of conditional fee arrangements 18012", "can the minister confirm that a significant number of companies will be involved in taking on the arrangements or are small companies especially likely to find it very difficult to get cover because of insurance companies lack of interest in the scheme", "my background is in industry i started on the shop floor at the age of 18 and eventually moved into industrial management i have had many clients over the years and worked with many thousands of people i have also been active in small business\u2014it was getting smaller and smaller\u2014for about 14 years the nearer the election came the smaller it got\ni have also been unemployed i know how wasteful unemployment is of peoples energies and talents i know how hard it is for families unemployment is my main concern the social chapter and a range of other measures from europe will cause unemployment\nthe social chapter does not contain a great deal at the moment it is a procedure however that is what makes it dangerous not only could it grow to incorporate many things but the countries involved in it could move on to the social charter they have agreed to move towards it that would involve many more measures than are contained in the social chapter we should consider that carefully\neurope has had employment regulations for many years that is why growth in europe has been comparatively sluggish european countries have had low levels of job creation particularly compared with the united states my visits to the united states have shown me that much though i like the country it is hardly as efficient as britain however it is less regulated that is the difference between the united states and the european union\nthere is high unemployment in the european union unemployment is lower in this country that is not a coincidence our unemployment rate is approximately 72 per cent as against 106 per cent on the continent why is that we have been doing well for some years but we cannot be complacent there are many threats to the wellbeing of our national economy not just from europe economies across the world are starting to challenge us those lowtax lowspend economies are creating jobs and growth they are a direct threat to employment in this country we must be conscious of that\nhow do we meet that threat and come out on top we cannot do it through the old jobsforlife syndrome those days are long gone regardless of which party is in government we have to do it through efficiency will the social chapter and all the regulations that are coming from brussels help us to be more efficient they cannot it is no coincidence that we are doing so much better than other european union countries we do not have the labour laws that exist on the continent we do not have the social chapter we have better industrial relations and fewer addon labour costs in short we are basically less european\nwhat do we mean by less european it seems that we are attracting a great deal of investment into this country for one reason we are so much better than the rest of europe if we were exactly the same as the rest of europe i should have thought that inward investment would have gone right to the geographic centre of europe it would make sense to invest in the very centre the japanese are not investing in the very centre of europe because it is not as efficient as this country\n945 pm\nas my right hon and learned friend the member for folkestone and hythe mr howard said we must look at the addon labour costs\u2014the extraordinary amount that it costs to employ a person in germany and on the continent generally compared with this country the difference between what it costs to pay somebody and what that person takes home is crucial in germany it costs a fortune to employ a worker but that worker\n\n\ndoes not take as much home that crucial difference creates jobs jobs are created not by governments regulations or even businesses but by customers with money in their pockets\nthe social chapter and all the employment laws that are coming forward will stifle business in this country as my right hon and learned friend said if the measures are so good why cannot the government introduce them in this country when they are found to fail the government could repeal them in this country if companies want to live by the rules and laws anyway that is a matter for them\nthe debate is about something more important than just the contents of the social chapter i refer to a letter that i received only yesterday from a company in my constituency it states\nmy company is product of the thatcher revolution founded in 1984 with just eight people we now employ approaching 300 our growth is directly attributable to changed attitudes in both the factory floor and management we have built up a worthwhile export business what i do not understand is why sensible british businessmen should see any advantage in belonging to such a high cost club\nthat is the crucial point the regulations have not helped that man to build up his business he describes very well what has helped him to do so efficiency\nthe social chapter is bad in itself but the issue goes an awful lot deeper taken with a range of other things it is about who governs britain we have the social chapter and economic and monetary union under which the monetary and fiscal policies of countries that join it will be determined not in each country but in brussels\ni am not frightened to address the issue of sovereignty i know that we have had a little debate about sovereignty just on conservative benches we should not walk away from it sovereignty is not just some romantic theory it enables us to create the economy that suits our own industry our own businesses and our own work force we should not be afraid to claim the right to govern ourselves in the areas of employment monetary policy and fiscal policy\nwe have done remarkably well in this country i speak genuinely on behalf of people on the shop floor i am concerned about their jobs i see a great threat to jobs in this country we need only look across to europe to see the 18 million people who are unemployed do we want to join them and go along with the sluggish growth that we have seen in europe for far too long or go our own way and be able to compete with the asian tigers and all the growing economies in the world", "does my right hon friend agree that the government seem to be extremely sensitive on this issue when i tabled a question to ask why the grant was given the president of the board of trade replied that she had not been involved in the grant that did not answer the question was not the right hon lady overdefensive before an allegation was even made", "can the leader of the house be a little more specific about the committee stage of the government of wales bill following the point raised by my hon friend the member for north essex mr jenkin and also the hon member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney mr rowlands who sits on the government benches will she take into account the fact that although hon members from wales have a great deal to contribute to such a bill so do hon members on both sides of the house", "what assessment he has made of the adequacy of the present laws relating to the occupying of land by groups of travellers 15784", "i thank the minister for that reply i am encouraged by what he said is he aware that at least 100 people descended on my constituency of tewkesbury this summer it took a full two weeks to clear them from the land during which time there was great mayhem in the town which is trying to regenerate itself will the minister assure my constituents and the house that he will carefully monitor the situation", "i do not want to speak for long but i believe that a fundamental issue is at stake as this is a matter of such importance it is extraordinary that people in scotland wales and now in london are being asked to vote merely on the principle and not on any details it is odd that referendums come before legislation these referendums have major constitutional implications expenditure matters will have to be considered and powers will have to be shifted from one body to another\nthe public are concerned about the honesty of politicians i am a new member and i have noticed a great deal of dishonesty the way in which the government have behaved since they took office is not as the electorate might have expected there have been betrayals many labour supporters refer to the governments uturns as betrayals they have made uturns on tuition fees cold weather payments and tobacco advertising\nthe people of london will be asked to vote on a proposal about which they know very little the last time they were in office the labour government had their fingers burned because they proposed legislation before the referendums and could not get their business through the house\nthe name of the london authority also raises an issue of honesty it is now to be the greater london authority whereas in the past it was the greater london council are the government frightened to go back to that august body or is this change of name yet another smokescreen\nmore particularly i want to know exactly what the authority will do will it be yet another tier of bureaucracy from my travels around my constituency and throughout the country it is clear that people are tired of politicians and of government yet the government\n\n\nwant to create further tiers of bureaucracy and more levels of government throughout the kingdom these proposals have many more constitutional implications\nwhere will the balance of power lie between existing london authorities and the new authority what will be the division of power what will the new mayor of this great authority do will he be powerful or not will he chair council meetings and if so which ones", "my hon friend is right no one has any idea what will happen", "i am grateful to my hon friend but as there is now someone on the government front bench i shall continue\ni cannot answer the questions that i have posed it is up to the government to explain to the house and to the people of london the role of the new authority and the mayor and how that will affect the role of district authorities if a \u00a3100000 salary is to be paid many people will be asking how they can become mayor of this great body\nas the government get into further difficulties they start to retreat into themselves i advise them not to keep putting up smokescreens because it is not doing them any good\non a wider constitutional issue the government should explain to the people of london and to the house whether they are creating yet another region of europe there will be some sort of government in scotland and wales and the government have not yet published their plans for regional government in england will the greater london authority be yet another of those regions that would have important implications these matters should be explained not in a white paper but in full legislation before the people of london are asked to vote on it", "i have no problem opposing the bill my first reason concerns the wider constitutional implications which have been discussed with great eloquence i was sent by my constituency to oppose bills such as this we heard from my hon friend the member for rochford and southend east sir t taylor about the drip drip drip process we are constantly told that there will be no more transfer of power from this country to brussels but what do we find more transfer of power from britain to brussels\nsecondly i object to some of the items in the treaty we must question why a level playing field is desirable how will that benefit britain in terms of inward investment will foreign countries invest in britain if we are the same as all the other countries in europe what is the point of investing on the edge of europe if we are the same as the rest of europe if the costs of employment in the united kingdom are the same as in the rest of europe countries such as japan will invest in the centre of europe which is germany not in this country\nwhat benefits will the social chapter bring british workers we must look across the continent of europe to see the benefits that the social chapter and similar legislation have brought people there levels of unemployment across europe are shameful i do not want britain to go down that road\nthe treaty has many constitutional implications some of which have been mentioned tonight i shall deal with one or two article 13 is against any discrimination on grounds of religion or belief what implications does that have for church schools for example has that been thought through article 13 also rules out discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation although we in the conservative party are extremely tolerant what implications does that have for national law in respect of gay marriage for example will such proposals be decided in brussels rather than in our own parliament\ni am glad to go into the lobby tonight with the conservative party united for labour members to criticise conservative members for inconsistency is a bit rich labour members should question how many times they have changed their minds on whether we should be a member of the european union", "the answer to the hon gentlemans question is simple at the 1975 referendum when two out of three people endorsed our continued membership of the european community the booklet britains new deal in europe which was issued by the labour government specifically guaranteed that if a british minister objected to any legislation within europe that would be the end of the legislation if the government are to take us down a different road they should at least have the courtesy to revisit the british electorate", "if she will make a statement regarding the governments intended stance at the forthcoming ottawa conference in connection with antipersonnel land mines 14117", "i thank the right hon lady for that answer and i wish her well in her attempts to secure a worldwide ban is she aware that many land mines throughout the world are cleared by children as young as 10 what will the government do to prevent that", "rose\u2014", "rose\u2014", "will the leader of the house make time available for a debate or at least a statement on the time that ministers take to reply or give full replies to hon members questions i understand that departments try to answer such letters within 15 working days but i cannot be alone in having letters outstanding for in one case 55 working days and in another involving the treasury for 47 working days\u2014and still no reply yet i understand that ministers receive many letters from hon members but if we are to do our jobs properly we need to respond to our constituents concerns rather quicker than that", "what are his priorities for the scottish criminal justice system and if he will make a statement 12038", "i thank the right hon gentleman for that answer i am sure that he will want to confirm that it is his intention that the scottish criminal justice system should be seen to be independent and free from political manoeuvres if so will he explain the context of the transfer of jason campbell from a scottish prison to the maze in northern ireland", "if he will list the steps he is taking to establish the levels of public satisfaction with community policing in each area 11677", "the hon gentleman will be aware of the publics concern about community policing he will also be aware that the police do not view bobbies on the beat as the most effective way of policing given the importance of the publics perception of policing in their areas being favourable how does the minister intend to deal with that", "will the hon lady give way", "will the hon lady give way", "the hon gentleman makes some powerful points but to get all those points across to the people of wales in one week would be rather difficult surely the referendums should therefore be either on the same day or as has already been suggested six months apart", "the benefit was yours", "my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford mr wells was correct to raise the issue of the green belt because a report in the sunday times at the weekend quoted one of the prime ministers ministers at the department for the environment transport and the regions does the prime minister realise that in gloucestershire such remarks about building on green fields as opposed to brownfield sites will cause great alarm does he also agree that although it may be cheaper and more convenient to build on greenfield sites the longterm costs to future generations would be enormous 9743", "to ask the secretary of state for international development if she will make a statement on the steps that her department is taking to ensure that aid from the united kingdom a reaches and helps the worlds poorest people and b is not kept by their governments 8359", "i am grateful to the secretary of state for that answer given that unesco cleaned up its act because the united kingdom and the united states left\n\n\nsome years ago how does the secretary of state intend to ensure that any money that we give it is used wisely after all we have now reentered unesco and that august body tends to deal at government level", "on a point of order madam speaker does the secretary of state for\n\nwales understand hon members concern about his declaration that parliament will remain sovereign but will not have the opportunity to question someone who supposedly represents wales\u2014the secretary of state\u2014because the assembly will seemingly have sovereign powers in wales", "i congratulate the hon member for west tyrone mr thompson on a tremendously confident and if i may say so competent speech i am always greatly impressed by the passion with which northern ireland members speak and the love that they have for their constituencies and the province that they represent the hon gentleman mentioned that he is here by virtue of the creation of a new seat in northern ireland i am familiar with such feelings because mine is also a new seat although in a different part of the country\u2014gloucestershire\ni hope that northern ireland members will forgive me for intruding as an english member on the debate there is no reason why people should know this but i made my maiden speech on the subject of scottish devolution simply because although i am not scottish or from northern ireland i have a great passion for the united kingdom\ni congratulate ministers and shadow ministers on their appointments to the front benches there are many other issues that concern northern ireland but the defeat of the ira and all violence in the province must be the first priority i recognise the need for regeneration and i should like to mention a few aspects that could help the process they may be novel ideas but they deserve a mention\nsome time ago we witnessed the advent of mixed schools in northern ireland that children from all traditions could attend what provision is there for the continuation and encouragement of that process local democracy was mentioned earlier i urge caution on moving towards proportional representation but i want more specifically to ask what plans are in hand for the strengthening of local democracy\u2014giving more powers to local government\u2014iin northern ireland to give people elected to councils something worthwhile to do\non a recent visit to northern ireland i observed that there was a good setup for local government but that the elected representatives had little responsibility i do not mean to be unkind\u2014i am sure that northern ireland members know what i mean i am aware that there is a difficulty in that some of the councillors elected in belfast for instance are members of sinn fein but we must consider what can be done about the situation more peace might come to the province if local people are able to have more power and control over what happens there\nhas an expanded enterprise zone for belfast been considered with more inducements for inward investment and companies perhaps paying less tax as an encouragement for them to come there in the first place as an attempt to regenerate the province\nfinally on the peace process i urge that no time or finance be wasted on going down roads that have been shown to have failed in the past we cannot expect much good will from the men of violence we should not waste too much time seeking it", "it is a privilege to make my first speech in such an important debate i congratulate the hon members who have made such excellent maiden speeches i pay tribute to the courage and determination of the hon member for edinburgh west mr gorrie who has arrived at the house after five attempts although it has not taken me five attempts i know how he feels i also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire mr lansley who made an excellent speech to the labour members who spoke so well and to the hon ladies who have spoken with such wit charm and wisdom\nall those hon ladies on the labour benches present something of a problem to the hon ladies on the conservative benches because they get mistaken for labour members given what was said earlier i am not sure whether it is worse to be mistaken for a labour members wife or for a labour member the thought of that persuaded my wife to stand for gloucestershire county council rather than parliament happily 2 may provided an opportunity for a double celebration at least in tewkesbury\nit really was a celebration because it is a great privilege to represent such a wonderful constituency tewkesbury has many urban parts but the countryside has been described as\na place of gentle contrasts\nmy arrival in tewkesbury was a more severe contrast than might have been thought in 1471 there was a famous battle at tewkesbury in the war of the roses it was won by the yorkists as many hon members will know i am glad to say that the 1997 battle of tewkesbury was\n\n\nconvincingly won by a lancastrian it gives me great pleasure to serve as the first member of parliament for tewkesbury as a seat in itself for more than 100 years\nit is the custom of the house to pay tribute to ones predecessors that may take me a while because the seat has been cobbled together from several different constituencies most of it was contained in the old seat of cirencester and tewkesbury which was represented with such distinction by nicholas ridley i pay tribute to his successor my hon friend the member for cotswold mr cliftonbrown who represented the seat with great distinction for five years i thank him also for the help that he gave me i am pleased to pay tribute to the work of the hon member for cheltenham mr jones part of whose constituency i have taken last but by no means least i pay tribute to paul marland who unfortunately lost his seat partly because of the boundary changes and partly because of the swing against the conservatives i took quite a chunk of his seat for which he does not thank me\nwe in tewkesbury somewhat bucked the national trend i like to think that that was at least partly due to the clear ideas that we put to the electorate i stood on an unashamedly british ticket fighting against european federalism and stressing the need for and benefits of preserving the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it has been said before but it is my firm belief that the united kingdom as a whole is stronger than the sum of its parts our strength has been built together thanks to the strength of the union and in no small part thanks to 18 years of conservative government the new labour government inherit a strong prosperous united nation\nit is impossible to separate the bill from the wider issue of devolution and impossible to separate devolution from the prospect of the united kingdom breaking up devolution could usher in the beginning of the end of the united kingdom i have no interest to declare as such but i have something of a love affair with scotland it is incorrect to assume that english members have no knowledge of scotland i have spent much time there and indeed worked there for a while i have a great passion for scotland that is why i am so determined that it should remain part of the united kingdom\ni see great danger for scotland in moving down the devolutionary road scotland could be left to fend for itself as a small country in a hostile european union the hardearned freedom that it would have gained from the united kingdom would soon be snatched away by the federalist tendencies of that body in such circumstances what strength would scotland have to fight against the federalist tendencies that it once wanted to throw off\ni am not convinced that the suggested great demonstrable demand for devolution exists many people are making noises for it but they cannot necessarily claim to represent the views of the majority i believe that many people in scotland as was acknowledged earlier want to retain the status quo they see no need for another layer of bureaucracy to be imposed upon them and certainly see no need for up to 3p in the pound more income tax to be levied on them\nmany people in scotland will be against devolution scots who live in scotland can vote against it but what about scottish people who no longer live in scotland\n\nthey may live in another part of what they consider to be their country the united kingdom we have learned from the government this week that such people will have no say for whatever reason they chose to live in another part of the united kingdom but they should be given some say in what happens to the united kingdom tearing scotland away from the united kingdom which is the prospect that we face is surely a matter for all of us the policy of allowing only people who reside in scotland to vote is inconsistent with existing law which allows british people who have left our shores to continue to vote in our elections\nit has not escaped anyones attention that the conservative party has no representation in the house from scotland or wales or for that matter from northern ireland in general although not this time the conservative party commands a majority of seats in england it is in the interests of the conservative party especially with such a large hill to climb to let the united kingdom break up in such circumstances the conservative party could enjoy almost perpetual government in england i am not a member of a party that is interested in narrow electoral advantage i belong to a party that believes in the wider interests of the united kingdom those interests are not best served by going down the devolution route\nwe are at risk from devolution and from so rapid an introduction of the bill people in scotland may be persuaded to vote for devolution as a reaction against what they may have regarded as an english conspiracy to govern them i believe in democracy that is one reason why i joined the conservative party if a significant majority of scottish people clearly and consistently\u2014those two words are important\u2014showed that they wanted devolution we would of course have to accept that verdict the danger with such a rushed bill is that if only a small majority of people in scotland voted in favour the government would rush devolution through that did not happen in 1978 when a small majority\u2014329 per cent\u2014voted in favour against 308 per cent who voted against the then labour government had insisted that at least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote had to vote yes the legislation fell and so did the labour government shortly after that is perhaps what worries the government\ngiven the precedents and the importance of the matter is not it reasonable to ask the government before they set up a scottish parliament with taxraising powers to be absolutely sure that such an arrangement is preferred by a sizeable number of scottish people and not by only a small majority on a very low turnout\nmuch is at stake through the bill including 300 years of history the economic strength that has been achieved and the future of the united kingdom the issues before us should not be hurried nor should they be treated lightly\ni conclude my remarks by thanking the house for extending its courtesy to me"]
